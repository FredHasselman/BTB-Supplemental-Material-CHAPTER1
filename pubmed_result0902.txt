AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a specific deficit in
      reading despite adequate overall intelligence and educational resources. The
      neurological substrate underlying these significant behavioral impairments is not
      known. Studies of post mortem brain tissue from male and female dyslexic
      individuals revealed focal disruptions of neuronal migration concentrated in the 
      left hemisphere, along with aberrant symmetry of the right and left the planum
      temporale, and changes in cell size distribution within the medial geniculate
      nucleus of the thalamus (Galaburda et al., 1985; Humphreys et al., 1990). More
      recent neuroimaging studies have identified several changes in the brains of
      dyslexic individuals, including regional changes in gray matter, changes in white
      matter, and changes in patterns of functional activation. In a further effort to 
      elucidate the etiology of dyslexia, epidemiological and genetic studies have
      identified several candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes. Some recent work has 
      investigated associations between some of these genetic variants and structural
      changes in the brain. Variants of one candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene,
      KIAA0319, have been linked to morphological changes in the cerebellum and
      functional activational changes in the superior temporal sulcus (Jamadar et al., 
      2011; Pinel et al., 2012). Animal models have been used to create a knockdown of 
      Kiaa0319 (the rodent homolog of the human gene) via in utero RNA interference in 
      order to study the gene's effects on brain development and behavior. Studies
      using this animal model have demonstrated that knocking down the gene leads to
      focal disruptions of neuronal migration in the form of ectopias and heterotopias,
      similar to those observed in the brains of human dyslexics. However, further
      changes to the structure of the brain have not been studied following this
      genetic disruption. The current study sought to determine the effects of
      embryonic Kiaa0319 knockdown on volume of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as 
      midsagittal area of the corpus callosum in male rats. Results demonstrate that
      Kiaa0319 knockdown did not change the volume of the cortex or hippocampus, but
      did result in a significant reduction in the midsagittal area of the corpus
      callosum. Taken in the context of previous reports of behavioral deficits
      following Kiaa0319 knockdown (Szalkowski et al., 2012), and reports that
      reductions of corpus callosum size are related to processing deficits in humans
      (Paul, 2011), these results suggest that Kiaa0319 has a specific involvement in
      neural systems important for temporal processing.

TI  - Evidence for cerebellar dysfunction in Chinese children with developmental
      dyslexia: an fMRI study.
AB  - ABSTRACT Numerous studies reported that developmental dyslexia in alphabetic
      languages was associated with a wide range of sensorimotor deficits, including
      balance, motor skill and time estimation, explained by skill automatization
      deficit hypothesis. Neural correlates of skill automatization deficit point to
      cerebellar dysfunction. Recently, a behavioral study revealed an implicit motor
      learning deficit in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia in their left
      hands, indicating left cerebellar dysfunction. Using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), our study examined the brain activation during implicit
      motor learning in 9 Chinese dyslexic and 12 age-matched children. Dyslexic
      children showed abnormal activations in the left cerebellum, left middle/medial
      temporal lobe and right thalamus compared with age-matched children during
      implicit motor learning. These findings provide evidence of cerebellar
      abnormality in Chinese dyslexic people. Furthermore, dysfunction of the left
      cerebellum in Chinese dyslexia is inconsistent with the right cerebellum
      abnormalities that were reported by studies on alphabetic-language dyslexia,
      suggesting that neurobiological abnormalities of impaired reading are probably
      language specific.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Letter-speech sound integration in fluent readers takes place
      automatically and is dependent on temporal synchrony between letters and sounds. 
      In developmental dyslexia, however, letter-speech sound associations are hard to 
      learn, compromising accurate and fluent reading. We studied the effect of printed
      text on processing speech sounds in dyslexic and fluent adult readers. METHODS:
      Visual stimuli were presented with sequences of spoken syllables including vowel 
      or consonant changes, or changes in syllable intensity, frequency, or vowel
      duration. As visual material, written syllables or their scrambled images were
      used. The auditory stimuli were presented either synchronously with the visual
      stimuli or time delayed. The mismatch negativity (MMN), an index of automatic
      neural change detection, was recorded. RESULTS: MMN amplitudes were larger to
      syllable changes in combination with written syllables than with scrambled images
      in fluent readers. However, dyslexic readers showed no difference between
      syllables vs. scrambled image condition. Furthermore, MMNs to consonant and
      frequency changes peaked later in dyslexic than fluent readers. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest deficient and sluggish audiovisual integration in dyslexic
      individuals, which is not dependent on the phonological relevance of the deviant 
      type. SIGNIFICANCE: Unlike previous studies, our study included several different
      types of syllable changes presented with concurrent print, enabling us to
      determine in more detail the nature of the audiovisual deficit in dyslexia.

AB  - Dyslexia is a polygenic developmental reading disorder characterized by an
      auditory/phonological deficit. Based on the latest genetic and neurophysiological
      studies, we propose a tentative model in which phonological deficits could arise 
      from genetic anomalies of the cortical micro-architecture in the temporal lobe.

TI  - Predicting reading disability: early cognitive risk and protective factors.
PG  - 1-10

AB  - This longitudinal study examined early cognitive risk and protective factors for 
      Grade 2 reading disability (RD). We first examined the reading outcome of 198
      children in four developmental cognitive subgroups that were identified in our
      previous analysis: dysfluent trajectory, declining trajectory, unexpected
      trajectory and typical trajectory. We found that RD was unevenly distributed
      among the subgroups, although children with RD were found in all subgroups. A
      majority of the children with RD had familial risk for dyslexia. Second, we
      examined in what respect children with similar early cognitive development but
      different RD outcome differ from each other in cognitive skills, task-focused
      behaviour and print exposure. The comparison of the groups with high cognitive
      risk but different RD outcome showed significant differences in phonological
      skills, in the amount of shared reading and in task-focused behaviour. Children
      who ended up with RD despite low early cognitive risk had poorer cognitive
      skills, more task avoidance and they were reading less than children without RD
      and low cognitive risk. In summary, lack of task avoidance seemed to act as a
      protective factor, which underlines the importance of keeping children interested
      in school work and reading. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - An assessment of gene-by-environment interactions in developmental
      dyslexia-related phenotypes.
PG  - 47-55
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12000 [doi]
AB  - While the genetic and environmental contributions to developmental dyslexia (DD) 
      have been studied extensively, the effects of identified genetic risk
      susceptibility and of specified environmental hazardous factors have usually been
      investigated separately. We assessed potential gene-by-environment (GxE)
      interactions on DD-related reading, spelling and memory phenotypes. The presence 
      of GxE effects were investigated for the DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319 and ROBO1 genes,
      and for seven specified environmental moderators in 165 nuclear families in which
      at least one member had DD, by implementing a general test for GxE interaction in
      sib-pair-based association analysis of quantitative traits. Our results support a
      diathesis-stress model for both reading and memory composites: GxE effects were
      found between some specified environmental moderators (i.e. maternal smoke during
      pregnancy, birth weight and socio-economic status) and the DYX1C1-1259C/G marker.
      We have provided initial evidence that the joint analysis of identified genetic
      risk susceptibility and measured putative risk factors can be exploited in the
      study of the etiology of DD and reading-related neuropsychological phenotypes,
      and may assist in identifying/preventing the occurrence of DD.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a highly heritable neurological disorder that is
      prevalent in school-aged children. The dyslexia-associated gene DCDC2 is a member
      of the DCX family of genes known to play roles in neurogenesis, neuronal
      migration, and differentiation. However, the associations between DCDC2 genetic
      variations and dyslexia have yielded inconclusive results. Clarifying the effects
      of DCDC2 polymorphisms on dyslexia risk will advance not only elucidation of the 
      role of DCDC2 in the brain development but also development of possible
      therapeutic approach for dyslexia. In this review, we summarized the ongoing
      association studies concerning DCDC2 polymorphisms and dyslexia risk by using
      meta-analysis and revealed that DCDC2 rs807701 might contribute significantly to 
      dyslexia risk.

PG  - 245-60
LID - 10.1080/17470218.2012.705305 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigated the nature of visual spatial attention deficits in
      adults with developmental dyslexia, using a partial report task with five-letter,
      digit, and symbol strings. Participants responded by a manual key press to one of
      nine alternatives, which included other characters in the string, allowing an
      assessment of position errors as well as intrusion errors. The results showed
      that the dyslexic adults performed significantly worse than age-matched controls 
      with letter and digit strings but not with symbol strings. Both groups produced
      W-shaped serial position functions with letter and digit strings. The dyslexics' 
      deficits with letter string stimuli were limited to position errors, specifically
      at the string-interior positions 2 and 4. These errors correlated with letter
      transposition reading errors (e.g., reading slat as "salt"), but not with the
      Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) task. Overall, these results suggest that the
      dyslexic adults have a visual spatial attention deficit; however, the deficit
      does not reflect a reduced span in visual-spatial attention, but a deficit in
      processing a string of letters in parallel, probably due to difficulty in the
      coding of letter position.

AB  - To date, the nature of the phonological deficit in developmental dyslexia is
      still debated. We concur with possible impairments in the representations of the 
      universal phonological constraints that universally govern how phonemes co-occur 
      as a source of this deficit. We were interested in whether-and how-dyslexic
      children have sensitivity to sonority-related markedness constraints. We tested
      10 French dyslexic children compared with 20 typically developing chronological
      age-matched and reading level-matched controls. All were tested with two aurally 
      administered syllable counting tasks that manipulated well-formedness of
      unattested consonant clusters, as determined by universal phonological
      sonority-related markedness constraints (onset clusters in Experiment 1;
      intervocalic clusters in Experiment 2). Surprisingly, dyslexic children's
      response patterns were similar to those in both control groups; as universal
      phonological sonority-related markedness increased, dyslexic children
      increasingly perceptually confused and phonologically repaired clusters with an
      illusory epenthetic vowel (e.g., /bal/). Although dyslexic children were
      systematically slower, like both control groups, they were influenced by
      universal sonority-related markedness constraints and hierarchically ranked
      constraints specific to French over evident acoustic-phonetic contrasts or
      sonority-unrelated cues. Our results are counterintuitive but innovative and
      compete to question an impaired universal phonological grammar because dyslexic
      children were found to have normal universal phonological constraints and were
      skilled to restore phonotactically legal syllable structures with a
      language-specific illusory epenthetic vowel (i.e., //-like vowel). We discuss
      them regarding active phonological decoding and recoding processes within the
      framework of the optimality theory.

TI  - The frequency modulated auditory evoked response (FMAER), a technical advance for
      study of childhood language disorders: cortical source localization and selected 
      case studies.
PG  - 12
AB  - ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Language comprehension requires decoding of complex,
      rapidly changing speech streams. Detecting changes of frequency modulation (FM)
      within speech is hypothesized as essential for accurate phoneme detection, and
      thus, for spoken word comprehension. Despite past demonstration of FM auditory
      evoked response (FMAER) utility in language disorder investigations, it is seldom
      utilized clinically. This report's purpose is to facilitate clinical use by
      explaining analytic pitfalls, demonstrating sites of cortical origin, and
      illustrating potential utility. RESULTS: FMAERs collected from children with
      language disorders, including Developmental Dysphasia, Landau-Kleffner syndrome
      (LKS), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also normal controls - utilizing
      multi-channel reference-free recordings assisted by discrete source analysis -
      provided demonstratrions of cortical origin and examples of clinical utility.
      Recordings from inpatient epileptics with indwelling cortical electrodes
      provided, direct assessment of FMAER origin. The FMAER is shown to normally arise
      from bilateral posterior superior temporal gyri and immediate temporal lobe
      surround. Childhood language disorders associated with prominent receptive
      deficits demonstrate absent left or bilateral FMAER temporal lobe responses. When
      receptive language is spared, the FMAER may remain present bilaterally. Analyses 
      based upon mastoid or ear reference electrodes are shown to result in erroneous
      conclusions. Serial FMAER studies may dynamically track status of underlying
      language processing in LKS. FMAERs in ASD with language impairment may be normal 
      or abnormal. Cortical FMAERs can locate language cortex when conventional
      cortical stimulation does not. CONCLUSION: The FMAER measures the processing by
      the superior temporal gyri and adjacent cortex of rapid frequency modulation
      within an auditory stream. Clinical disorders associated with receptive deficits 
      are shown to demonstrate absent left or bilateral responses. Serial FMAERs may be
      useful for tracking language change in LKS. Cortical FMAERs may augment invasive 
      cortical language testing in epilepsy surgical patients. The FMAER may be normal 
      in ASD and other language disorders when pathology spares the superior temporal
      gyrus and surround but presumably involves other brain regions. Ear/mastoid
      reference electrodes should be avoided and multichannel, reference free
      recordings utilized. Source analysis may assist in better understanding of
      complex FMAER findings.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a neurobiological deficit characterized by persistent
      difficulty in learning to read in children and adults who otherwise possess
      normal intelligence. Functional and structural connectivity data suggest that
      developmental dyslexia could be a disconnection syndrome. However, whether
      abnormalities in connectivity exist in beginning readers at-risk for reading
      difficulties is unknown. Using graph-theoretical analysis, we investigated
      differences in global and regional topological properties of structural brain
      networks in 42 beginning readers with (FH+) and without (FH-) familial risk for
      reading difficulties. We constructed separate structural correlation networks
      based on measures of surface area and cortical thickness. Results revealed
      changes in topological properties in brain regions known to be abnormal in
      dyslexia (left supramarginal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus) in the FH+ group
      mainly in the network constructed from measures of cortical surface area. We also
      found alterations in topological properties in regions that are not often
      advertised as dyslexia but nonetheless play important role in reading (left
      posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and left precentral gyrus). To our knowledge,
      this is the first report of altered topological properties of structural
      correlation networks in children at risk for reading difficulty, and motivates
      future studies that examine the mechanisms underlying how these brain networks
      may mediate the influences of family history on reading outcome.

AB  - The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationship
      between non-verbal auditory disorders and developmental dyslexia. This question
      has led to conflicting results in the literature, which we argued might be due to
      a failure to consider the heterogeneity of dyslexic profiles. This study included
      three groups of adult participants: unimpaired readers and dyslexic readers with 
      or without a phonological deficit. Auditory temporal processing deficits, as
      measured by stream segregation thresholds, were present in most dyslexic
      participants with phonological disorders. In contrast, most dyslexic participants
      with preserved phonological skills had normal auditory stream segregation
      thresholds. Overall, the present study leads to a better understanding of the
      relationship between phonological and sequential auditory processing disorders in
      developmental dyslexia. In addition, it demonstrates for the first time the
      importance of considering the heterogeneity of individual cognitive profiles when
      investigating the role of auditory deficits in developmental dyslexia.

AB  - We investigated the phonological and surface subtypes of developmental dyslexia
      in light of competing predictions made by two computational models of single word
      reading, the Dual-Route Cascaded Model (DRC; Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, &
      Ziegler, 2001) and Harm and Seidenberg's connectionist model (HS model; Harm &
      Seidenberg, 1999). The regression-outlier procedure was applied to a large sample
      to identify children with disproportionately poor phonological coding skills
      (phonological dyslexia) or disproportionately poor orthographic coding skills
      (surface dyslexia). Consistent with the predictions of the HS model, children
      with "pure" phonological dyslexia, who did not have orthographic deficits, had
      milder phonological impairments than children with "relative" phonological
      dyslexia, who did have secondary orthographic deficits. In addition, pure cases
      of dyslexia were more common among older children. Consistent with the
      predictions of the DRC model, surface dyslexia was not well conceptualized as a
      reading delay; both phonological and surface dyslexia were associated with
      patterns of developmental deviance. In addition, some results were problematic
      for both models. We identified a small number of individuals with severe
      phonological dyslexia, relatively intact orthographic coding skills, and very
      poor real word reading. Further, a subset of controls could read normally despite
      impaired orthographic coding. The findings are discussed in terms of improvements
      to both models that might help better account for all cases of developmental
      dyslexia.

PG  - 11-28
LID - 10.1017/S0305000912000098 [doi]
AB  - This study tests the hypothesis that developmental dyslexia is (partly) caused by
      a deficit in implicit sequential learning, by investigating whether infants at
      familial risk of dyslexia can track non-adjacent dependencies in an artificial
      language. An implicit learning deficit would hinder detection of such
      dependencies, which mark grammatical relations (e.g. between 'is' and '-ing' in
      'she is happily singing'). In a head-turn experiment with infants aged 1;6,
      family risk and typically developing infants were exposed to one of two novel
      languages containing dependencies of the type a-X-c, b-X-d or a-X-d, b-X-c, with 
      fixed first and third elements and twenty-four different X elements. During test,
      typically developing children listened longer to ungrammatical strings (i.e. that
      did not correspond to their training language). However, family-risk children did
      not discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings, indicating
      deficient implicit learning. The implications of these findings in relation to
      dyslexia and other language-based disorders are discussed.

      developmental language disorders.
PG  - 121-31
LID - 10.1037/a0031277 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Children with developmental language disorders have been shown to be
      impaired not only in language processing (including syntax), but also in rhythm
      and meter perception. Our study tested the influence of external rhythmic
      auditory stimulation (i.e., musical rhythm) on syntax processing in children with
      specific language impairment (SLI; Experiment 1A) and dyslexia (Experiment 1B).
      Method: Children listened to either regular or irregular musical prime sequences 
      followed by blocks of grammatically correct and incorrect sentences. They were
      required to perform grammaticality judgments for each auditorily presented
      sentence. Results: Performance of all children (SLI, dyslexia, and controls) in
      the grammaticality judgments was better after regular prime sequences than after 
      irregular prime sequences, as shown by d' data. The benefit of the regular prime 
      was stronger for SLI children (partial eta2 = .34) than for dyslexic children
      (partial eta2 = .14), who reached higher performance levels. Conclusion: Together
      with previous findings on deficits in temporal processing and sequencing, as well
      as with the recent proposition of a temporal sampling (oscillatory) framework for
      developmental language disorders (U. A. Goswami, 2011, Temporal sampling
      framework for developmental dyslexia, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Vol. 15, pp. 
      3-10), our results point to potential avenues in using rhythmic structures (even 
      in nonverbal materials) to boost linguistic structure processing. (PsycINFO

AB  - Most studies today agree about the link between visual-attention and oculomotor
      control during reading: attention seems to affect saccadic programming, that is, 
      the position where the eyes land in a word. Moreover, recent studies show that
      visuo-attentional processes are strictly linked to normal and impaired reading.
      In particular, a large body of research has found evidence of defective
      visuo-attentional processes in dyslexics. What do eye movements tell us about
      visuo-attentional deficits in developmental dyslexia? The purpose of this paper
      is to explore the link between oculomotor control and dyslexia, taking into

TI  - Predictors of developmental dyslexia in European orthographies with varying
      complexity.
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.12029 [doi]
AB  - Background: The relationship between phoneme awareness, rapid automatized naming 
      (RAN), verbal short-term/working memory (ST/WM) and diagnostic category is
      investigated in control and dyslexic children, and the extent to which this
      depends on orthographic complexity. Methods: General cognitive, phonological and 
      literacy skills were tested in 1,138 control and 1,114 dyslexic children speaking
      six different languages spanning a large range of orthographic complexity
      (Finnish, Hungarian, German, Dutch, French, English). Results: Phoneme deletion
      and RAN were strong concurrent predictors of developmental dyslexia, while verbal
      ST/WM and general verbal abilities played a comparatively minor role. In logistic
      regression models, more participants were classified correctly when orthography
      was more complex. The impact of phoneme deletion and RAN-digits was stronger in
      complex than in less complex orthographies. Conclusions: Findings are largely
      consistent with the literature on predictors of dyslexia and literacy skills,
      while uniquely demonstrating how orthographic complexity exacerbates some
      symptoms of dyslexia.

TI  - Profiling dyslexia in bilingual adolescents.
PG  - 529-42
LID - 10.3109/17549507.2012.693201 [doi]
AB  - This article addresses the issue of whether difficulties with reading and writing
      in a second language learner stem from developmental dyslexia or from issues
      associated with second language acquisition. In line with a phonological
      explanatory model of dyslexia, phonological processing and reading (decoding at
      both word and text levels) were tested, using data from 10 Spanish-Swedish
      speaking adolescents whose teachers had identified them as possibly having
      dyslectic difficulties, and a matched comparison group of 10 Spanish-Swedish
      speaking adolescents with no reading difficulties. Unlike previous studies, this 
      analysis takes into account results from both languages and uses a matched
      bilingual comparison group as the norm. Based on these results, a bilingual
      dyslexia continuum is proposed as an analytical tool to be used for the
      assessment of developmental dyslexia from a bilingual perspective. The
      systematized continuum offers various degrees of difficulty -from high
      indications of dyslexia to no indications of dyslexia-and the positioning along
      this continuum by the target group participants of this study provides examples
      of both over- and under-identification of dyslexia. Overall, a greater number of 
      participants in the target group were under-identified rather than
      over-identified by the schools. An important insight of this study is that the
      positioning of bilingual participants on the continuum would have been different 
      if the analysis had taken only one of the two languages into account.
      Furthermore, possible effects from differences between Spanish and Swedish
      orthographies and syllable structure were observed, as, in general, the
      participants read more accurately in Spanish. The present data also suggest that 
      decoding processing might vary more in second-language learners with dyslexia
      compared to monolingual individuals with dyslexia.

AB  - Efficient reading relies on expertise in the visual word form area, with
      abnormalities in the functional specialization of this area observed in
      individuals with developmental dyslexia. We have investigated event related
      potentials in print tuning in adults with dyslexia, based on their N170 response 
      at 135-255 ms. Control and dyslexic adults performed a lexical decision task with
      symbol strings and four sets of word-like stimuli (consonant strings,
      pseudowords, low frequency words and high frequency words). N170 tuning was
      observed in the control group, with larger left occipito-temporal negativities
      for word-like stimuli than for symbol strings. In contrast, N170 specialization
      was lacking in dyslexics, suggesting no visual expertise for print. Moreover,
      behavioral data indicated that adults with dyslexia had longer latencies and more
      errors for pseudowords than for other stimuli, suggesting a persistent
      phonological deficit in these individuals. These findings suggest that altered
      decoding abilities may disrupt perceptual expertise for print. The results are
      discussed in the context of the phonological mapping deficit theory.

AB  - The current study examined auditory processing deficits in dyslexia using a
      dichotic pitch stimulus and functional MRI. Cortical activation by the dichotic
      pitch task occurred in bilateral Heschl's gyri, right planum temporale, and right
      superior temporal sulcus. Adolescents with dyslexia, relative to age-matched
      controls, illustrated greater activity in left Heschl's gyrus for random noise,
      less activity in right Heschl's gyrus for all auditory conditions, and less
      activity in right superior temporal sulcus for a dichotic melody. Subsequent
      analyses showed that these group differences were attributable to dyslexic
      readers who performed poorly on the psychophysical task. Furthermore, behavioral 
      performance on phonological reading was correlated to activity from dichotic
      conditions in right Heschl's gyrus and right superior temporal sulcus. It is
      postulated that these differences between reader groups is primarily due to a
      noise exclusion deficit shown previously in dyslexia.

TI  - Old and new ways to study characteristics of reading disability: the case of the 
      nonword-reading deficit.
PG  - 414-56
LID - 10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.06.003 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical and computational models of reading have traditionally been informed 
      by specific characteristics of disabled readers. One of the most frequently
      studied marker effects of developmental dyslexia is the nonword-reading deficit. 
      Disabled readers are generally believed to show a specific problem in reading
      nonwords. This study presents a survey of frequently cited methods used to
      examine this effect by controlling general reading ability in various ways. An
      extensive analysis, however, shows that the majority of these methods (grade
      equivalents scores, the reading-level match design, and interactions in a
      chronological-age match design) actually fail to account for confounding
      variables such as age and general slowing, potentially affecting the conclusions 
      reached. To alleviate this problem, an alternative method is presented: i.e.
      state trace analysis. Applying this method in a sample of Dutch disabled and
      typical readers, the results revealed an absence of a nonword-reading deficit in 
      the disabled readers. Furthermore, after controlling for their decoding ability, 
      disabled readers showed inferior word reading performance, which strongly
      suggests that the fundamental problem of disabled readers does not relate to the 
      reading of nonwords but concerns their (dis)ability to acquire orthographic
      (word-specific) knowledge. Further, predictions for disabled readers in an
      inconsistent orthography like English are formulated. Finally, based on a review 
      of neurobiological studies, implications for theories of reading disability are
      discussed.

TI  - A case control study on specific learning disorders in school going children in
      Bikaner city.
PG  - 1477-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To asses the prevalence of learning disorders in school going children
      and to compare the socio-demographic variables and other related factors with
      learning disorder. METHODS: All the 500 students of class III to V with all
      sections were given the dyslexia assessment questionnaire (DAQ) to fill; 468
      students returned the completed forms.Statistical analysis was done using
      chi-square test. Only 68 children scored >/= 4 on DAQ were given MISIC (Mallin's 
      intelligence scale for Indian children) for IQ assessment and DST-J for dyslexia 
      screening. Forty-eight students were labeled as dyslexia and further diagnosis
      was confirmed by DSM IV- TR classification. RESULTS: Prevalence of learning
      disorders (LD) was found to be 10.25% with higher in males than females (11.40%
      vs. 7.14%).The delivery complications (20.83% vs. 4.17%; X 2-4.667, p
      value-0.031) were more in LD and more family members were left handed (16.67% vs.
      2.08%; X 2-4.41, p value-0.036) as compared to control group. In classroom
      behavior, children with LD asked questions less (10.42% vs. 75%; X 2-40.91, p
      value-0.0001), answered questions less frequently (6.25% vs. 79.16%; X 2-52.15, p
      value-0.0001) and took notes less attentively than control group (4.17% vs.
      58.33%; X 2-32.77, p value-0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The current study, therefore, is
      an attempt to identify children with learning disorders and explore the
      prevalence of the problem and etiological factors e.g., family environment,
      social factors and developmental issues of child and associated co-morbidities.
      More studies with larger sample size should be undertaken to get accurate picture
      of these disorders.There is also need for some community based programme to raise
      the level of awareness and knowledge about these disorders in general population.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to examine the extent to which 
      Chinese dyslexic children experience deficits in phonological and orthographic
      processing skills and (b) to examine if Chinese dyslexia is associated with
      deficits in Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive (PASS) processing. 
      A total of 27 Grade 4 children with dyslexia (DYS), 27 Grade 4 chronological age 
      (CA) controls, and 27 Grade 2 reading age (RA) controls were tested on measures
      of phonological awareness, rapid naming, phonological memory, PASS, reading
      accuracy, and reading fluency. The results indicated that the DYS group performed
      significantly poorer than the CA and RA groups on both measures of phonological
      awareness and on a measure of orthographic processing but comparably to the RA
      group on a measure of rapid naming and both measures of phonological memory. In
      regard to the PASS processing skills, the DYS group performed worse than the CA
      controls on Successive and Simultaneous processing but comparably to the RA group
      on all PASS processing skills. Implications of these findings for early
      identification and intervention of reading difficulties are discussed.

TI  - Attentional requirements during acquisition and consolidation of a skill in
      normal readers and developmental dyslexics.
PG  - 744-57
LID - 10.1037/a0030235 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research demonstrated that individuals with developmental
      dyslexia (DD) may suffer from a deficit in the acquisition stage of a new skill, 
      whereas consolidation processes seem to be preserved. The present study was
      designed to examine whether this impaired acquisition was attributable to a lack 
      of automatization, and whether the reported preserved consolidation was
      attributable to the use of DDs' conscious compensation strategies. These aims
      were implemented by testing a skill-learning task in dyslexics and normal readers
      using a dual task paradigm. The impact of dual task costs on participants'
      performance was used as an indication for automaticity. METHOD: DD and control
      groups completed a sequence-learning task over a first session (acquisition) and 
      a second session 24 hours later (consolidation). The task was performed by half
      of the participants under a full attention condition and by the other half under 
      a divided attention condition. RESULTS: Consistent with previous reports in the
      literature, divided attention impaired sequence learning in both groups.
      Nevertheless, divided attention resulted in delayed acquisition of the motor
      skill in the DD group compared with normal readers. Finally, divided attention
      enhanced motor procedural consolidation only in the control group. CONCLUSIONS:
      The differential effect of divided attention on acquisition and consolidation of 
      procedural skill in DD and normal readers supports the cerebellum deficit
      hypothesis in DD. In addition, the enhanced skill consolidation in normal readers
      under divided attention suggests that attentional requirements are not necessary 
      for all types of human learning.

AB  - Noninvasive quantitative MRI methods, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can
      offer insights into the structure-function relationships in human developmental
      brain disorders. In this article, we quantified the macrostructural and
      microstructural attributes of the corpus callosum (CC) in children with dyslexia 
      and in typically developing readers of comparable age and gender. Diffusion
      anisotropy, and mean, radial and axial diffusivities of cross-sectional CC
      subregions were computed using a validated DTI methodology. The normalized
      posterior CC area was enlarged in children with dyslexia relative to that in
      typically developing children. Moreover, the callosal microstructural attributes,
      such as the mean diffusivity of the posterior middle sector of the CC, correlated
      significantly with measures of word reading and reading comprehension. Reading
      group differences in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and radial
      diffusivity were observed in the posterior CC (CC5). This study demonstrates the 
      utility of regional DTI measurements of the CC in understanding the neurobiology 
      of reading disorders.

PG  - 1841-56
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2012.04.009 [doi]
AB  - This article reports two different studies examining the theoretical account of
      low-level deficits in beat perception as an alternative explanation of
      developmental dyslexia in Greek, an orthographically consistent language. Study I
      examined the relationship of amplitude rise time and frequency discrimination
      with measures of phonological processing, working memory, and reading fluency in 
      a large unselected sample of Grade 4 children. Study II examined the presence of 
      beat perception deficits in groups of Grade 2, 4, and 6 children with dyslexia
      and their chronological age controls. The results provided no evidence to support
      meaningful associations between beat perception tasks and reading or the
      theoretical account of beat perception deficits as a sufficient explanation or
      contributing factor to dyslexia. Implications on the importance of auditory
      processing in reading in orthographically consistent languages are discussed.

AB  - While the genetic and environmental contributions to Developmental Dyslexia (DD) 
      have been studied extensively, the effects of identified genetic risk
      susceptibility and of specified environmental hazardous factors have usually been
      investigated separately. We assessed potential gene-by-environment interactions
      (GxE) on DD-related reading, spelling and memory phenotypes. The presence of GxE 
      effects were investigated for the DYX1C1, DCDC2, KIAA0319 and ROBO1 genes, and
      for 7 specified environmental moderators in 165 nuclear families in which at
      least one member had DD, by implementing a general test for GxE interaction in
      sib pair-based association analysis of quantitative traits. Our results support a
      diathesis-stress model for both reading and memory composites: GxE effects were
      found between some specified environmental moderators (i.e., maternal smoke
      during pregnancy, birth weight, and socio-economic status) and the DYX1C1-1259C/G
      marker. We have provided initial evidence that the joint analysis of identified
      genetic risk susceptibility and measured putative risk factors can be exploited
      in the study of the aetiology of DD and reading-related neuropsychological
      phenotypes, and may assist in identifying/preventing the occurrence of DD.

TI  - TMS on Right Frontal Eye Fields Induces an Inflexible Focus of Attention.
AB  - The focus of spatial attention can be not only oriented to a particular location,
      but also adjusted in its size to select visual information from a narrow
      (zoom-in) or broad (zoom-out) region of the visual field. Attentional orienting, 
      saccades programming, and visual search have been linked to the frontal eye
      fields (FEF) activity. However, the FEF causal role in the frontoparietal network
      for the attentional focus size modulation remains unclear. Here, we delivered
      single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on FEF while participants
      performed an attentional zooming task. They were asked to detect a visual target 
      appearing at 3 eccentricities from the fixation. Two cue types modulated the size
      of the attended region: a small cue was employed to narrow the attentional focus,
      whereas a large cue induced participants to broaden the attended region. Results 
      showed that TMS delivered on the right FEF, but not on the left FEF, was able to 
      interfere with both zoom-in and zoom-out attentional mechanisms. Our results
      provide the first evidence of the right FEF casual role in the attentional
      zooming control and give new insights into the neural mechanisms of dysfunctional
      spatial attention deployment shown in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
      autism and dyslexia.

AB  - ERP studies have revealed that for alphabetic languages letter/speech-sound
      integration develops with brain maturation and reading instruction over a
      relatively long period of time. Experienced adult readers associate letters and
      speech sounds automatically, as indexed by enhanced mismatch negativity (MMN) to 
      simultaneously presented stimuli, but reveal attenuated MMN when the speech sound
      stimuli are presented with a delay. Chinese as a logographic language differs
      substantially from alphabetic languages and therefore integration processes might
      be characterized by unique timing mechanisms. In the present study, MMN was used 
      to investigate the timing and automaticity of association between characters and 
      lexical tones in adult native Chinese speakers. A character was presented
      simultaneously with a lexical tone, or with either a 100ms stimulus onset
      asynchrony (SOA) or a 200ms SOA in separate conditions. MMN was enhanced when the
      character and the lexical tone were presented with 100ms SOA, while no
      significant MMN enhancement was observed with simultaneous presentation or with
      200ms SOA. These results suggest that the automatic association of characters and
      lexical tones in experienced Chinese adult readers requires more processing time 
      than for alphabetic languages. These results highlight critical differences
      between fundamental reading processes across different writing systems. The
      neural differences between alphabetic and logographic languages for
      letter/character and speech-sound/tone integration need to be taken into
      consideration when considering past and future research on reading processes in
      these languages and especially for investigations of reading disorders, such as
      developmental dyslexia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The dyslexia susceptibility 1 candidate 1 (DYX1C1) gene has recently 
      been associated with dyslexia and reading scores in several population samples.
      The DYX1C1 has also been shown to affect neuronal migration and modulate estrogen
      receptor signaling. METHODS: We have analyzed the molecular networks of DYX1C1 by
      gene expression and protein interaction profiling in a human neuroblastoma cell
      line. RESULTS: We find that DYX1C1 can modulate the expression of nervous system 
      development and neuronal migration genes such as RELN and associate with a number
      of cytoskeletal proteins. We also show by live cell imaging that DYX1C1 regulates
      cell migration of the human neuroblastoma cell line dependent on its
      tetratricopeptide repeat and DYX1 protein domains. The DYX1 domain is a novel
      highly conserved domain identified in this study by multiple sequence alignment
      of DYX1C1 proteins recovered from a wide range of eukaryotic species.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to the hypothesis that dyslexia has a
      developmental neurobiological basis by linking DYX1C1 with many genes involved in
      neuronal migration disorders.

TI  - Evidence for a deficit in orthographic structure processing in Chinese
      developmental dyslexia: an event-related potential study.
PG  - 20-31
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2012.06.010 [doi]
AB  - The present event-related potential (ERP) study aimed to examine group
      differences in processing of orthographic information in Chinese children with
      dyslexia and typically developing children. Twelve dyslexic (ages 100-125 months)
      and 11 control (ages 104-124 months) children were given a character decision
      task (similar to a lexical decision task). For the control group, the radical
      position information influenced the character processing at a later stage of
      semantic information processing as reflected by a more negative N400 component in
      the pseudocharacter condition, in which the semantic and phonetic radical were
      combined following correct orthographic rules, as compared to the noncharacter
      condition, in which the structure of the semantic and phonetic radicals was
      reversed from that for each real character. In contrast, the dyslexic group
      showed no such differences across the experimental conditions for the N400
      component. Results suggest that Chinese children with dyslexia may have a deficit
      in processing orthographic information (specifically, radical position).
      Furthermore, a late positive component (LPC) was elicited in both groups,
      suggesting that children may have to back track on their earlier semantic memory 
      in order to make a final decision as to whether the character is real or not.

TI  - Spelling-stress regularity effects are intact in developmental dyslexia.
AB  - The current experiment investigated conflicting predictions regarding the effects
      of spelling-stress regularity on the lexical decision performance of skilled
      adult readers and adults with developmental dyslexia. In both reading groups,
      lexical decision responses were significantly faster and significantly more
      accurate when the orthographic structure of a word ending was a reliable as
      opposed to an unreliable predictor of lexical stress assignment. Furthermore, the
      magnitude of this spelling-stress regularity effect was found to be equivalent
      across reading groups. These findings are consistent with intact phoneme-level
      regularity effects also observed in dyslexia. The paper discusses how findings of
      intact spelling-sound regularity effects at both prosodic and phonemic levels, as
      well as other similar results, can be reconciled with the obvious difficulties
      that people with dyslexia experience in other domains of phonological processing.

TI  - Lexical-semantic processing in the semantic priming paradigm in aphasic patients.
PG  - 718-26
LID - S0004-282X2012000900014 [pii]
AB  - There is evidence that the explicit lexical-semantic processing deficits which
      characterize aphasia may be observed in the absence of implicit semantic
      impairment. The aim of this article was to critically review the international
      literature on lexical-semantic processing in aphasia, as tested through the
      semantic priming paradigm. Specifically, this review focused on aphasia and
      lexical-semantic processing, the methodological strengths and weaknesses of the
      semantic paradigms used, and recent evidence from neuroimaging studies on
      lexical-semantic processing. Furthermore, evidence on dissociations between
      implicit and explicit lexical-semantic processing reported in the literature will
      be discussed and interpreted by referring to functional neuroimaging evidence
      from healthy populations. There is evidence that semantic priming effects can be 
      found both in fluent and in non-fluent aphasias, and that these effects are
      related to an extensive network which includes the temporal lobe, the pre-frontal
      cortex, the left frontal gyrus, the left temporal gyrus and the cingulated
      cortex.

PG  - 791-805
LID - 10.3109/02699206.2012.702185 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that word reading accuracy, 
      not oral language, is associated with spelling performance in school-age
      children. We compared fourth grade spelling accuracy in children with specific
      language impairment (SLI), dyslexia or both (SLI/dyslexia) to their typically
      developing grade-matched peers. Results of the study revealed that children with 
      SLI performed similarly to their typically developing peers on a single-word
      spelling task. Alternatively, those with dyslexia and SLI/dyslexia evidenced poor
      spelling accuracy. Errors made by both those with dyslexia and SLI/dyslexia were 
      characterized by numerous phonologic, orthographic and semantic errors.
      Cumulative results support the hypothesis that word reading accuracy, not oral
      language, is associated with spelling performance in typically developing
      school-age children and their peers with SLI and dyslexia. Findings are provided 
      as further support for the notion that SLI and dyslexia are distinct, yet
      co-morbid, developmental disorders.

TI  - [A study of reading disorder comorbid with pervasive developmental disorder or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder].
PG  - 378-86
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the frequency and characteristics of reading disorder 
      comorbid with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD). METHODS: Articulation times and
      reading errors were evaluated using four Japanese reading tasks (a monomoraic
      syllable reading task, a word reading task, a non-word reading task, and a short 
      sentence reading task) in 31 children with PDD (22 boys and 9 girls) aged 6-14
      years (average 9.5 years) and 39 children with AD/HD (33 boys and 6 girls) aged
      6-12 years (average 9.6 years). Poor readers (PRs) were identified when
      articulation times were significantly longer than those of typically-developing
      children (> or = 2.0 SD) for two or more reading tasks, and non-PRs were
      identified when articulation times were within normal range (<2.0 SD) for all
      reading tasks. RESULTS: Eight children with PDD (25.8%) and 17 children with
      AD/HD (43.6%) were identified as PRs. For 13 of the 70 subjects, the chief
      complaints were difficulties in reading and writing words at their first visit to
      our hospital. All 13 of these subjects had AD/HD, and twelve of these were
      additionally identified as PRs. Among the remaining 26 children with AD/HD, five 
      (19.2%) were identified as PRs. In AD/HD children, PRs made significantly more
      reading errors and had lower IQ scores than did non-PRs, but in PDDchildren,
      there were no significant differences between these two groups regarding IQ or
      reading errors. An analysis using the Clinical-Symptoms-Checklist for Reading and
      Writing Words revealed that PRs in our study showed difficulties in reading words
      in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: PRs in our study had reading disorders, which would, 
      in turn, mean that reading disorder was often comorbid with PDD or AD/HD. These
      results strongly indicate the necessity of testing for the presence of reading
      disorder in children with PDD or AD/HD.

TI  - First-degree relatives of young children with autism spectrum disorders: some
      gender aspects.
PG  - 1642-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2012.03.025 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal risk factors, with special focus on gender distribution of
      neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions were analysed in first-degree
      relatives in a population-based group of young children with autism spectrum
      disorders (ASD). Multiple information sources were combined. This group was
      contrasted with the general population regarding data from the Swedish Medical
      Birth register. In the ASD group, information was also obtained at parental
      interviews focusing on developmental and psychiatric disorders in the family.
      Compared to the general population, fathers of children with ASD were older and
      parents more often of non-European origin. Mothers of children with ASD had an
      increased rate of antidepressant and psychoactive medication use, and of
      scheduled caesarean sections. Fathers and brothers of children with ASD had high 
      rates of ASD including the broader phenotype. Mothers of children with ASD had
      high rates of depression and other psychiatric disorders. These findings,
      hypothetically, could reflect a different ASD phenotype and difficulties
      diagnosing ASD in females or be an example of the close genetic relation between 
      ASD and other psychiatric disorders. The results suggest that, in clinical and
      research settings, the familial background in ASD should be reviewed with a
      broader approach, and not be restricted to "looking out" only for diagnoses and
      symptoms traditionally accepted as being part of or typical of ASD. The high rate
      of parents of non-European origin has been noted in many Swedish studies of ASD, 
      but the reason for this association, remains unclear.

TI  - Multiple stimulus presentation yields larger deficits in children with
      developmental dyslexia: A study with reading and RAN-type tasks.
AB  - In this study, we examined the effect of multiple versus single stimulus
      presentation in typically developing readers and children with developmental
      dyslexia. The tasks involved either reading single words or arrays of words or
      naming single or multiple colors and digits (rapid automatized naming or RAN). To
      be able to compare these sets of conditions, we recorded total response times
      (i.e., the time between stimulus onset and the end of the participant's vocal
      response) in all cases. The study included 43 typically developing readers and 25
      children with dyslexia. Results indicate that typically developing readers have a
      clear advantage with multiple over single items on both RAN and reading tasks.
      The children with dyslexia showed a moderate advantage for multiple stimuli in
      naming colors and digits but presented the opposite pattern in reading. With
      regard to reading, the disproportionate impairment of the children with dyslexia 
      in dealing with multiple arrays suggests difficulty in integrating the multiple
      subcomponents of the reading task over and above the basic nuclear deficit in
      decoding words. Regarding the RAN tasks, results confirm that the requirement of 
      integrating multiple subcomponents may be critical in mediating the predictive
      value of these measures on reading.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia, a severe and persistent reading and spelling impairment, 
      is characterized by difficulties in processing speech sounds (i.e., phonemes).
      Here, we test the hypothesis that these phonological difficulties are associated 
      with a dysfunction of the auditory sensory thalamus, the medial geniculate body
      (MGB). By using functional MRI, we found that, in dyslexic adults, the MGB
      responded abnormally when the task required attending to phonemes compared with
      other speech features. No other structure in the auditory pathway showed distinct
      functional neural patterns between the two tasks for dyslexic and control
      participants. Furthermore, MGB activity correlated with dyslexia diagnostic
      scores, indicating that the task modulation of the MGB is critical for
      performance in dyslexics. These results suggest that deficits in dyslexia are
      associated with a failure of the neural mechanism that dynamically tunes MGB
      according to predictions from cortical areas to optimize speech processing. This 
      view on task-related MGB dysfunction in dyslexics has the potential to reconcile 
      influential theories of dyslexia within a predictive coding framework of brain
      function.

TI  - Music education for improving reading skills in children and adolescents with
      dyslexia.
PG  - CD009133
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009133.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyslexia (or developmental dyslexia or specific reading disability)
      is a specific learning disorder that has a neurobiological origin. It is marked
      by difficulties with accurate or fluent recognition of words and poor spelling in
      people who have average or above average intelligence and these difficulties
      cannot be attributed to another cause, for example, poor vision, hearing
      difficulty, or lack of socio-environmental opportunities, motivation, or adequate
      instruction. Studies have correlated reading skills with musical abilities. It
      has been hypothesized that musical training may be able to remediate timing
      difficulties, improve pitch perception, or increase spatial awareness, thereby
      having a positive effect on skills needed in the development of language and
      literacy. OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of music education on reading
      skills (that is, oral reading skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency,
      phonological awareness, and spelling) in children and adolescents with dyslexia. 
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases in June 2012:
      CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to May Week 4 2012 ), EMBASE (1980 to 2012
      Week 22), CINAHL (searched 7 June 2012), LILACS (searched 7 June 2012), PsycINFO 
      (1887 to May Week 5 2012), ERIC (searched 7 June 2012), Arts and Humanities
      Citation Index (1970 to 6 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index -
      Social Sciences and Humanities (1990 to 6 June 2012), and WorldCat (searched 7
      June 2012). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry
      Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of studies. We did not apply any date or
      language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomized controlled 
      trials. We looked for studies that included at least one of our primary outcomes.
      The primary outcomes were related to the main domain of the reading: oral reading
      skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and
      spelling, measured through validated instruments. The secondary outcomes were
      self esteem and academic achievement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors
      (HCM and RBA) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified through 
      the search strategy to determine their eligibility. For our analysis we had
      planned to use mean difference for continuous data, with 95% confidence
      intervals, and to use the random-effects statistical model when the effect
      estimates of two or more studies could be combined in a meta-analysis. MAIN
      RESULTS: We retrieved 851 references via the search strategy. No randomized
      controlled trials testing music education for the improvement of reading skills
      in children with dyslexia could be included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:
      There is no evidence available from randomized controlled trials on which to base
      a judgment about the effectiveness of music education for the improvement of
      reading skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia. This uncertainty
      warrants further research via randomized controlled trials, involving a
      interdisciplinary team: musicians, hearing and speech therapists, psychologists, 
      and physicians.

TI  - Cerebellar Function in Developmental Dyslexia.
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a genetically based neurobiological syndrome, which is 
      characterized by reading difficulty despite normal or high general intelligence. 
      Even remediated dyslexic readers rarely achieve fast, fluent reading. Some
      dyslexics also have impairments in attention, short-term memory, sequencing
      (letters, word sounds, and motor acts), eye movements, poor balance, and general 
      clumsiness. The presence of "cerebellar" motor and fluency symptoms led to the
      proposal that cerebellar dysfunction contributes to the etiology of dyslexia.
      Supporting this, functional imaging studies suggest that the cerebellum is part
      of the neural network supporting reading in typically developing readers, and
      reading difficulties have been reported in patients with cerebellar damage.
      Differences in both cerebellar asymmetry and gray matter volume are some of the
      most consistent structural brain findings in dyslexics compared with good
      readers. Furthermore, cerebellar functional activation patterns during reading
      and motor learning can differ in dyslexic readers. Behaviorally, some children
      and adults with dyslexia show poorer performance on cerebellar motor tasks,
      including eye movement control, postural stability, and implicit motor learning. 
      However, many dyslexics do not have cerebellar signs, many cerebellar patients do
      not have reading problems, and differences in dyslexic brains are found
      throughout the whole reading network, and not isolated to the cerebellum.
      Therefore, impaired cerebellar function is probably not the primary cause of
      dyslexia, but rather a more fundamental neurodevelopmental abnormality leads to
      differences throughout the reading network.

TI  - Retrospective assessment of ADHD symptoms in childhood: discriminatory validity
      of Finnish translation of the Wender Utah Rating Scale.
PG  - 449-59
LID - 10.1177/1087054710397801 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the discriminatory validity of the Wender Utah Rating Scale
      (WURS) and its five suggested subscales (Conduct Problems, Impulsivity Problems, 
      Mood Difficulties, Inattention/Anxiety, Academic Concerns) in a Finnish sample.
      METHOD: WURS was administered to 114 adults, aged 18 to 55 years. Participants
      with ADHD (n = 37) and dyslexia (n = 36) were compared with healthy controls (n =
      41). RESULTS: The ADHD group scored significantly higher than the control group
      on all subscales. Compared with the dyslexia group, the ADHD group did not differ
      in Mood Difficulties or Academic Concerns. Using the total score, the positive
      predictive value was .53 in this sample and only .21 when the prevalence of ADHD 
      was taken into account. CONCLUSION: Three out of five domains of WURS are
      reliable indicators of ADHD. Domains with low discriminatory power, low general
      prevalence of ADHD, and other developmental disorders within the population
      decrease the accuracy.

TI  - Universality of categorical perception deficit in developmental dyslexia: an
      investigation of Mandarin Chinese tones.
PG  - 874-82
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02528.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While previous studies have shown that children affected by dyslexia 
      exhibit a deficit in categorical perception of segmental features in alphabetic
      languages, it remains unclear whether the categorical perception deficit
      generalizes to nonalphabetic languages at the suprasegmental level. In this
      study, we investigated the occurrence of categorical perception deficit in
      Mandarin lexical tones in Chinese children with dyslexia. METHODS: Both
      behavioral and electrophysiological measures were taken to compare Chinese
      dyslexic children with age-matched controls. Auditory event-related potentials
      were collected with a passive listening oddball paradigm. RESULTS: Behavioral
      data showed that dyslexic children perceived lexical tone contrasts less
      categorically and less precisely than age-matched controls. Consistent with the
      behavioral data, the across-category tone contrast elicited larger mismatch
      negativity than the within-category distinction in the left hemisphere for the
      age-matched controls but not for the dyslexic children. CONCLUSION: The
      behavioral and electrophysiological results demonstrate impaired categorical
      perception of lexical tones in Chinese children with dyslexia. Our findings
      support the hypothesis that children affected by dyslexia have a general deficit 
      in categorical perception of speech, which generalizes to nonalphabetic languages
      at the suprasegmental level.

TI  - Aetiology for the covariation between combined type ADHD and reading difficulties
      in a family study: the role of IQ.
PG  - 864-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2012.02527.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twin studies using both clinical and population-based samples suggest
      that the frequent co-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) and reading ability/disability (RD) is largely driven by shared genetic
      influences. While both disorders are associated with lower IQ, recent twin data
      suggest that the shared genetic variability between reading difficulties and ADHD
      inattention symptoms is largely independent from genetic influences contributing 
      to general cognitive ability. The current study aimed to extend the previous
      findings that were based on rating scale measures in a population sample by
      examining the generalisability of the findings to a clinical population, and by
      measuring reading difficulties both with a rating scale and with an objective
      task. This study investigated the familial relationships between ADHD, reading
      difficulties and IQ in a sample of individuals diagnosed with ADHD combined type,
      their siblings and control sibling pairs. METHODS: Multivariate familial models
      were run on data from 1,789 individuals at ages 6-19. Reading difficulties were
      measured with both rating scale and an objective task. IQ was obtained using the 
      Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WISC-III/WAIS-III). RESULTS: Significant phenotypic
      (.2-.4) and familial (.3-.5) correlations were observed among ADHD, reading
      difficulties and IQ. Yet, 53%-72% of the overlapping familial influences between 
      ADHD and reading difficulties were not shared with IQ. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding
      that familial influences shared with general cognitive ability, although present,
      do not account for the majority of the overlapping familial influences on ADHD
      and reading difficulties extends previous findings from a population-based study 
      to a clinically ascertained sample with combined type ADHD.

AB  - Motor sequence learning has been studied extensively in Developmental dyslexia
      (DD). The purpose of the present research was to examine procedural learning of
      letter names and motor sequences in individuals with DD and control groups. Both 
      groups completed the Serial Search Task which enabled the assessment of learning 
      of letter names and motor sequences independently of each other. Control
      participants learned both the letter names as well as the motor sequence. In
      contrast, individuals with DD were impaired in learning of the letter names
      sequence and showed a reliable transfer of the motor sequence. Previous studies
      proved that motor sequence learning is impaired in DD. The present study
      demonstrated that this deficit is more pronounced when the task to be learned
      involves linguistic units. This result implies that the procedural learning
      system of language is more deficient than the motor procedural learning system in
      individuals with DD. The dissociation between motor and letter names sequence
      learning in those with DD also implies that the systems underlying these two
      tasks are separable.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: exploring how much phonological and visual attention span
      disorders are linked to simultaneous auditory processing deficits.
AB  - The simultaneous auditory processing skills of 17 dyslexic children and 17
      skilled readers were measured using a dichotic listening task. Results showed
      that the dyslexic children exhibited difficulties reporting syllabic material
      when presented simultaneously. As a measure of simultaneous visual processing,
      visual attention span skills were assessed in the dyslexic children. We presented
      the dyslexic children with a phonological short-term memory task and a phonemic
      awareness task to quantify their phonological skills. Visual attention spans
      correlated positively with individual scores obtained on the dichotic listening
      task while phonological skills did not correlate with either dichotic scores or
      visual attention span measures. Moreover, all the dyslexic children with a
      dichotic listening deficit showed a simultaneous visual processing deficit, and a
      substantial number of dyslexic children exhibited phonological processing
      deficits whether or not they exhibited low dichotic listening scores. These
      findings suggest that processing simultaneous auditory stimuli may be impaired in
      dyslexic children regardless of phonological processing difficulties and be
      linked to similar problems in the visual modality.

      the Dual Route Model and the Phonological Deficit Theory of Dyslexia.
AB  - The dual route model (DRM) of reading suggests two routes of reading development:
      the phonological and the orthographic routes. It was proposed that although the
      two routes are active in the process of reading; the first is more involved at
      the initial stages of reading acquisition, whereas the latter needs more reading 
      training to mature. A number of studies have shown that deficient phonological
      processing is a core deficit in developmental dyslexia. According to the DRM,
      when the Lexical Decision Task (LDT) is performed, the orthographic route should 
      also be involved when decoding words, whereas it is clear that when decoding
      pseudowords the phonological route should be activated. Previous functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) studies have suggested that the upper left
      frontal lobe is involved in decision making in the LDT. The current study used
      fNIR to compare left frontal lobe activity during LDT performance among three
      reading-level groups: 12-year-old children, young adult dyslexic readers, and
      young adult typical readers. Compared to typical readers, the children
      demonstrated lower activity under the word condition only, whereas the dyslexic
      readers showed lower activity under the pseudoword condition only. The results
      provide evidence for upper left frontal lobe involvement in LDT and support the
      DRM and the phonological deficit theory of dyslexia.

AB  - The background noise of response times is often overlooked in scientific
      inquiries of cognitive performances. However, it is becoming widely acknowledged 
      in psychology, medicine, physiology, physics, and beyond that temporal patterns
      of variability constitute a rich source of information. Here, we introduce two
      complexity measures (1/f scaling and recurrence quantification analysis) that
      employ background noise as metrics of reading fluency. These measures gauge the
      extent of interdependence across, rather than within, cognitive components. In
      this study, we investigated dyslexic and non-dyslexic word-naming performance in 
      beginning readers and observed that these complexity metrics differentiate
      reliably between dyslexic and average response times and correlate strongly with 
      the severity of the reading impairment. The direction of change in the introduced
      metrics suggests that developmental dyslexia resides from dynamical instabilities
      in the coordination among the many components necessary to read, which could
      explain why dyslexic readers score below average on so many distinct tasks and
      modalities.

PG  - 71-81
LID - 10.1007/s11881-011-0064-y [doi]
AB  - Cross-linguistic studies suggest that the orthographic system determines the
      reading performance of dyslexic children. In opaque orthographies, the
      fundamental feature of developmental dyslexia is difficulty in reading accuracy, 
      whereas slower reading speed is more common in transparent orthographies. The aim
      of the current study was to examine the extent to which different variables of
      words affect reaction times and articulation times in developmental dyslexics. A 
      group of 19 developmental dyslexics of different ages and an age-matched group of
      19 children without reading disabilities completed a word naming task. The
      children were asked to read 100 nouns that differed in length, frequency, age of 
      acquisition, imageability, and orthographic neighborhood. The stimuli were
      presented on a laptop computer, and the responses were recorded using DMDX
      software. We conducted analyses of mixed-effects models to determine which
      variables influenced reading times in dyslexic children. We found that word
      naming skills in dyslexic children are affected predominantly by length, while in
      non-dyslexics children the principal variable is the age of acquisition, a
      lexical variable. These findings suggest that Spanish-speaking developmental
      dyslexics use a sublexical procedure for reading words, which is reflected in
      slower speed when reading long words. In contrast, normal children use a lexical 
      strategy, which is frequently observed in readers of opaque languages.

AB  - In this study, event related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the
      extent to which dyslexics (aged 9-13 years) differ from normally reading controls
      in early ERPs, which reflect prelexical orthographic processing, and in late
      ERPs, which reflect implicit phonological processing. The participants performed 
      an implicit reading task, which was manipulated in terms of letter-specific
      processing, orthographic familiarity, and phonological structure. Comparing
      consonant- and symbol sequences, the results showed significant differences in
      the P1 and N1 waveforms in the control but not in the dyslexic group. The reduced
      P1 and N1 effects in pre-adolescent children with dyslexia suggest a lack of
      visual specialization for letter-processing. The P1 and N1 components were not
      sensitive to the familiar vs. less familiar orthographic sequence contrast. The
      amplitude of the later N320 component was larger for phonologically legal
      (pseudowords) compared to illegal (consonant sequences) items in both controls
      and dyslexics. However, the topographic differences showed that the controls were
      more left-lateralized than the dyslexics. We suggest that the development of the 
      mechanisms that support literacy skills in dyslexics is both delayed and follows 
      a non-normal developmental path. This contributes to the hemispheric differences 
      observed and might reflect a compensatory mechanism in dyslexics.

      efficiency.
PG  - 201-7
LID - 10.1016/j.brs.2011.04.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor reading efficiency is the most persistent problem for adults
      with developmental dyslexia. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship
      between left posterior temporal cortex (pTC) function and reading ability,
      regardless of dyslexia status. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: In this study, we tested
      whether enhancing left lateralization of pTC using transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) improves reading efficiency in adults without dyslexia.
      METHOD: Twenty-five right-handed adults with no history of learning disorder
      participated. Real and sham "Left lateralizing" tDCS were applied to the pTC in
      separate sessions. Standardized word and nonword reading tests were given
      immediately after stimulation. RESULTS: Modeling of the induced electrical field 
      confirmed that tDCS was likely to increase left pTC excitability and reduce right
      pTC excitability as intended. Relative to sham, real tDCS induced improvements in
      word reading efficiency in below average readers. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing left
      lateralization of the pTC using tDCS improves word reading efficiency in
      below-average readers. This demonstrates that left lateralization of the pTC
      plays a role in reading ability, and provides stimulation parameters that could
      be used for a trial of tDCS in adults with developmental dyslexia. Such
      short-term gains could amplify the effect of appropriate reading interventions
      when performed in conjunction with them.

PG  - 2107-13
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.05.012 [doi]
AB  - Controversy still exists over whether there is a magnocellular deficit associated
      with developmental dyslexia. Here we utilised a magnocellular system-biased
      phantom contour form discrimination task defined by high temporal frequency
      contrast reversals to compare contrast sensitivity in a group of children with
      dyslexia and an age- and nonverbal intelligence-matched control group (9-14
      years). Stimuli were either abruptly presented for 4 refresh frames (34 ms), or
      in two reduced transience conditions had contrast progressively ramped on and off
      over either 4 frames or 10 frames (86 ms). Children in the dyslexia group showed 
      increased contrast thresholds compared with the control group in all three
      conditions, and thus strong evidence for a magnocellular deficit. Although the
      absolute size of the differences in threshold scores between control and dyslexic
      groups increased dramatically between the abrupt and the 4 and 10 frame ramped
      onset stimuli, the similar effect size across all tasks, and also the similar
      range of contrast change at the first frame of stimulus presentation across all
      tasks between groups suggests that a similar neural mechanism could provide the
      locus of the apparent magnocellular deficit in children with dyslexia for all
      tasks tested. These results suggest that threshold discrimination of stimuli with
      low contrast and high temporal frequencies designed to target the magnocellular
      system, and has great potential for early screening for children at risk of
      visually derived reading difficulties.

LID - 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.04.002 [doi]
AB  - In this review paper we address whether deficits in reading (i.e. developmental
      dyslexia) are rooted in neurobiological anomalies in white matter tracts.
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers an index of the connections between brain
      regions (via tractography) and of the white matter properties of these
      connections (via fractional anisotropy, FA). The reported studies generally show 
      that lower FA values in left temporoparietal and frontal areas are indicative of 
      poorer reading ability or dyslexia. Second, most studies have indicated that
      these regions coincide with the left arcuate fasciculus and corona radiata, with 
      fewer studies suggesting a role for the posterior part of the corpus callosum or 
      for more ventral tracts such as the inferior longitudinal fasciculus or the
      inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Finally, a quantitative activation
      likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on all reported studies that used a
      voxel-based approach reveals a cluster located close to the left temporoparietal 
      region (x=-29, y=-17, z=26). Fibertracking through this cluster demonstrates that
      this region hosts both the left arcuate fasciculus and the left corona radiata.

TI  - Neural intersections of the phonological, visual magnocellular and
      motor/cerebellar systems in normal readers: Implications for imaging studies on
      dyslexia.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22098 [doi]
AB  - We used fMRI to explore the extent of the anatomical overlap of three neural
      systems that the literature on developmental dyslexia associates with reading:
      the auditory phonological, the visual magnocellular, and the motor/cerebellar
      systems. Twenty-eight normal subjects performed four tasks during fMRI scans:
      word and pseudoword reading, auditory rhyming for letter names, visual motion
      perception, and a motor sequence learning task. We found that the left
      occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), which previous studies reported to be
      dysfunctional in dyslexia, can be fractionated into different functional areas:
      an anterior and lateral area that was activated by both reading and auditory
      rhyming tasks; a posterior area that was commonly activated by both the reading
      and the motion perception task and a medial/intermediate area, including the
      so-called Visual Word Form Area, which was specifically activated by the reading 
      task. These results show that the left OTC is an area of segregated convergence
      of different functional systems. We compared our results with the hypoactivation 
      pattern reported for reading in a previous cross-cultural PET study on 36
      dyslexic subjects from three countries. The region of decreased activation in
      dyslexia overlapped with regions that are specific for reading and those
      activated during both the auditory rhyming task and the single word and
      pseudoword reading task described in the present fMRI study. No overlap was found
      with the activation patterns for the visual motion perception task or for the
      motor sequence learning task. These observations challenge current theories of
      dyslexia. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - We used coordinate-based meta-analysis in order to objectively quantify gray
      matter abnormalities reported in nine Voxel-Based Morphometry studies of
      developmental dyslexia. Consistently across studies, reduced gray matter volume
      in dyslexic readers was found in the right superior temporal gyrus and left
      superior temporal sulcus. These results were related to findings from previous
      meta-analyses on functional brain abnormalities in dyslexic readers. Convergence 
      of gray matter reduction and reading-related underactivation was found for the
      left superior temporal sulcus. Recent studies point to the presence of both
      functional and structural abnormalities in left temporal and occipito-temporal
      brain regions before reading onset. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

TI  - Cognitive and neurological sequelae after stereoendoscopic disconnection of a
      hypothalamic hamartoma. A case study.
PG  - 274-8

AB  - Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are congenital malformations of the hypothalamus,
      often generating medically refractory gelastic seizures. There is great risk of
      progression to various complex partial and generalized seizures and of cognitive 
      and behavioral deterioration. Hence, various surgical approaches have been
      introduced to resect or disconnect the HH from surrounding tissue, and
      stereoendoscopic disconnection has been advocated as one of the most lenient
      approaches to sessile HH embedded in the third ventricle. In fact, no long-term
      neurological or cognitive impairments have hitherto been reported after this
      procedure. Yet, unforeseen complications may arise in any surgical intervention
      on this region. We found serious deterioration of memory and reading skills by
      comprehensive neuropsychological assessments pre- and postoperatively in a child 
      who, before surgery, was age-appropriate with respect to cognitive, emotional,
      and behavioral development. The child also contracted a permanent oculomotor
      paresis. Our results are discussed in light of previous relevant findings.

TI  - Neocortical disruption and behavioral impairments in rats following in utero RNAi
      of candidate dyslexia risk gene Kiaa0319.
PG  - 293-302
LID - 10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2012.01.009 [doi]
AB  - Within the last decade several genes have been identified as candidate risk genes
      for developmental dyslexia. Recent research using animal models and embryonic RNA
      interference (RNAi) has shown that a subset of the candidate dyslexia risk
      genes--DYX1C1, ROBO1, DCDC2, KIAA0319--regulate critical parameters of
      neocortical development, such as neuronal migration. For example, embryonic
      disruption of the rodent homolog of DYX1C1 disrupts neuronal migration and
      produces deficits in rapid auditory processing (RAP) and working
      memory--phenotypes that have been reported to be associated with developmental
      dyslexia. In the current study we used a modified prepulse inhibition paradigm to
      assess acoustic discrimination abilities of male Wistar rats following in utero
      RNA interference targeting Kiaa0319. We also assessed spatial learning and
      working memory using a Morris water maze (MWM) and a radial arm water maze. We
      found that embryonic interference with this gene resulted in disrupted migration 
      of neocortical neurons leading to formation of heterotopia in white matter, and
      to formation of hippocampal dysplasia in a subset of animals. These animals
      displayed deficits in processing complex acoustic stimuli, and those with
      hippocampal malformations exhibited impaired spatial learning abilities. No
      significant impairment in working memory was detected in the Kiaa0319 RNAi
      treated animals. Taken together, these results suggest that Kiaa0319 plays a role
      in neuronal migration during embryonic development, and that early interference
      with this gene results in an array of behavioral deficits including impairments
      in rapid auditory processing and simple spatial learning.

AB  - We tracked the developmental influences of exposure to French on developing
      English phonological awareness, decoding and reading comprehension of
      English-speaking at-risk readers from Grade 1 to Grade 3. Teacher-nominated
      at-risk readers were matched with not-at-risk readers in French immersion and
      English language programs. Exposure to spoken French phonetic and syllabic forms 
      and to written French orthographic and morphological forms by children attending 
      French immersion programs was expected to promote phonological, decoding and
      reading comprehension achievement. Growth in all outcomes was found, with
      children in immersion experiencing higher final status in phonological awareness 
      and more rapid growth and higher final status in decoding, using multilevel
      modeling. At-risk readers in French immersion experienced faster growth and
      higher final status in reading comprehension. Benefits to reading of exposure to 
      an additional language are discussed in relation to cross-language transfer,
      phonological grain size and enhanced executive control processes.

PG  - 683-94
LID - 10.1044/1092-4388(2011/10-0263) [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the relative contributions of phonological
      short-term memory and phonological representations to nonword repetition (NWR).
      This was evaluated in children with specific language impairment (SLI) and/or
      reading impairment (RI); it was also studied from a developmental perspective by 
      comparing 2 groups of typically developing (TD) children who differed in age.
      METHOD: NWR, digit span, vocabulary, and word and nonword discrimination were
      tested in 2 groups of TD children: one group matched on chronological age (CA TD 
      group: n = 41, mean age = 7;8 [months;years]), and one language age-matched
      control group (LA TD group: n = 16, mean age = 5;8). Also, 10 children with SLI, 
      14 children with RI, and 23 children with SLI and RI (hereafter, SLI + RI)
      participated and were matched to the age of the CA TD group. RESULTS: For the TD 
      children, NWR was predicted by discrimination, digit span, and age. The
      interaction between discrimination ability and age was also significant. Children
      with SLI + RI were significantly impaired on NWR compared with all other groups. 
      A regression analysis, including the CA TD group and the children with SLI and/or
      RI, showed that digit span, discrimination ability, and group (SLI + RI)
      contributed significantly to NWR. CONCLUSIONS: Phonological short-term memory and
      phonological representations both significantly contribute to NWR. The predictive
      strength of the quality of phonological representations changes during
      development.

PG  - 1543-52
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.03.007 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is associated with impaired speech-in-noise perception.
      The goal of the present research was to further characterize this deficit in
      dyslexic adults. In order to specify the mechanisms and processing strategies
      used by adults with dyslexia during speech-in-noise perception, we explored the
      influence of background type, presenting single target-words against backgrounds 
      made of cocktail party sounds, modulated speech-derived noise or stationary
      noise. We also evaluated the effect of three listening configurations differing
      in terms of the amount of spatial processing required. In a monaural condition,
      signal and noise were presented to the same ear while in a dichotic situation,
      target and concurrent sound were presented to two different ears, finally in a
      spatialised configuration, target and competing signals were presented as if they
      originated from slightly differing positions in the auditory scene. Our results
      confirm the presence of a speech-in-noise perception deficit in dyslexic adults, 
      in particular when the competing signal is also speech, and when both signals are
      presented to the same ear, an observation potentially relating to phonological
      accounts of dyslexia. However, adult dyslexics demonstrated better levels of
      spatial release of masking than normal reading controls when the background was
      speech, suggesting that they are well able to rely on denoising strategies based 
      on spatial auditory scene analysis strategies.

      and phonological analysis in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1553-64
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.03.008 [doi]
AB  - Whilst there is general consensus that phonological processing is deficient in
      developmental dyslexia, recent research also implicates visuo-attentional
      contributions. Capitalising on the P3a wave of event-related potentials as an
      index of attentional capture, we tested dyslexic and normal readers on a novel
      variant of a visual oddball task to examine the interplay of
      orthographic-phonological integration and attentional engagement. Targets were
      animal words (10% occurrence). Amongst nontarget stimuli were two critical
      conditions: pseudohomophones of targets (10%) and control pseudohomophones (of
      fillers; 10%). Pseudohomophones of targets (but not control pseudohomophones)
      elicited a large P3 wave in normal readers only, revealing a lack of attentional 
      engagement with these phonologically salient stimuli in dyslexic participants.
      Critically, both groups showed similar early phonological discrimination as
      indexed by posterior P2 modulations. Furthermore, phonological engagement, as
      indexed by P3a differences between pseudohomophone conditions, correlated with
      several measures of reading. Meanwhile, an analogous experiment using coloured
      shapes instead of orthographic stimuli failed to show group differences between
      experimental modulations in the P2 or P3 ranges. Overall, our results show that, 
      whilst automatic aspects of phonological processing appear intact in
      developmental dyslexia, the breakdown in pseudoword reading occurs at a later

AB  - Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterised by slow and
      inaccurate word recognition. Dyslexia has been reported in every culture studied,
      and mounting evidence draws attention to cross-linguistic similarity in its
      neurobiological and neurocognitive bases. Much progress has been made across
      research specialties spanning the behavioural, neuropsychological,
      neurobiological, and causal levels of analysis in the past 5 years. From a
      neuropsychological perspective, the phonological theory remains the most
      compelling, although phonological problems also interact with other cognitive
      risk factors. Work confirms that, neurobiologically, dyslexia is characterised by
      dysfunction of the normal left hemisphere language network and also implicates
      abnormal white matter development. Studies accounting for reading experience
      demonstrate that many recorded neural differences show causes rather than effects
      of dyslexia. Six predisposing candidate genes have been identified, and evidence 
      shows gene by environment interaction.

TI  - Perception of patterns of musical beat distribution in phonological developmental
      dyslexia: Significant longitudinal relations with word reading and reading
      comprehension.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In a recent study, we reported that the accurate perception of beat
      structure in music ('perception of musical meter') accounted for over 40% of the 
      variance in single word reading in children with and without dyslexia (Huss et
      al., 2011). Performance in the musical task was most strongly associated with the
      auditory processing of rise time, even though beat structure was varied by
      manipulating the duration of the musical notes. METHODS: Here we administered the
      same musical task a year later to 88 children with and without dyslexia, and used
      new auditory processing measures to provide a more comprehensive picture of the
      auditory correlates of the beat structure task. We also measured reading
      comprehension and nonword reading in addition to single word reading. RESULTS:
      One year later, the children with dyslexia performed more poorly in the musical
      task than younger children reading at the same level, indicating a severe
      perceptual deficit for musical beat patterns. They now also had significantly
      poorer perception of sound rise time than younger children. Longitudinal analyses
      showed that the musical beat structure task was a significant longitudinal
      predictor of development in reading, accounting for over half of the variance in 
      reading comprehension along with a linguistic measure of phonological awareness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The non-linguistic musical beat structure task is an important
      independent longitudinal and concurrent predictor of variance in reading
      attainment by children. The different longitudinal versus concurrent associations
      between musical beat perception and auditory processing suggest that individual
      differences in the perception of rhythmic timing are an important shared neural
      basis for individual differences in children in linguistic and musical
      processing.

AB  - Reading is a unique, cognitive human skill crucial to life in modern societies,
      but, for about 10% of the children, learning to read is extremely difficult. They
      are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder called dyslexia. Although impaired 
      auditory and speech sound processing is widely assumed to characterize dyslexic
      individuals, emerging evidence suggests that dyslexia could arise from a more
      basic cross-modal letter-to-speech sound integration deficit. Letters have to be 
      precisely selected from irrelevant and cluttering letters by rapid orienting of
      visual attention before the correct letter-to-speech sound integration applies.
      Here we ask whether prereading visual parietal-attention functioning may explain 
      future reading emergence and development. The present 3 year longitudinal study
      shows that prereading attentional orienting--assessed by serial search
      performance and spatial cueing facilitation--captures future reading acquisition 
      skills in grades 1 and 2 after controlling for age, nonverbal IQ, speech-sound
      processing, and nonalphabetic cross-modal mapping. Our findings provide the first
      evidence that visual spatial attention in preschoolers specifically predicts
      future reading acquisition, suggesting new approaches for early identification
      and efficient prevention of dyslexia.

PG  - 91-5
LID - 10.1016/j.actpsy.2012.03.003 [doi]
AB  - Auditory phoneme categories are less well-defined in developmental dyslexic
      readers than in fluent readers. Here, we examined whether poor recalibration of
      phonetic boundaries might be associated with this deficit. 22 adult dyslexic
      readers were compared with 22 fluent readers on a phoneme identification task and
      a task that measured phonetic recalibration by lipread speech (Bertelson,
      Vroomen, & De Gelder, 2003). In line with previous reports, we found that
      dyslexics were less categorical in the labeling of the speech sounds. The size of
      their phonetic recalibration effect, though, was comparable to that of normal
      readers. This result indicates that phonetic recalibration is unaffected in
      dyslexic readers, and that it is unlikely to lie at the foundation of their
      auditory phoneme categorization impairments. For normal readers however, it
      appeared that a well-calibrated system is related to auditory precision as the
      steepness of the auditory identification curve positively correlated with
      recalibration.

TI  - Impaired letter-string processing in developmental dyslexia: what
      visual-to-phonology code mapping disorder?
PG  - 77-93
LID - 10.1002/dys.1437 [doi]
AB  - Poor parallel letter-string processing in developmental dyslexia was taken as
      evidence of poor visual attention (VA) span, that is, a limitation of visual
      attentional resources that affects multi-character processing. However, the use
      of letter stimuli in oral report tasks was challenged on its capacity to
      highlight a VA span disorder. In particular, report of poor letter/digit-string
      processing but preserved symbol-string processing was viewed as evidence of poor 
      visual-to-phonology code mapping, in line with the phonological theory of
      developmental dyslexia. We assessed here the visual-to-phonological-code mapping 
      disorder hypothesis. In Experiment 1, letter-string, digit-string and
      colour-string processing was assessed to disentangle a phonological versus visual
      familiarity account of the letter/digit versus symbol dissociation. Against a
      visual-to-phonological-code mapping disorder but in support of a familiarity
      account, results showed poor letter/digit-string processing but preserved
      colour-string processing in dyslexic children. In Experiment 2, two tasks of
      letter-string report were used, one of which was performed simultaneously to a
      high-taxing phonological task. Results show that dyslexic children are similarly 
      impaired in letter-string report whether a concurrent phonological task is
      simultaneously performed or not. Taken together, these results provide strong
      evidence against a phonological account of poor letter-string processing in
      developmental dyslexia.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine if children with dyslexia learning to
      read a consistent orthography (Greek) experience auditory and visual processing
      deficits and if these deficits are associated with phonological awareness, rapid 
      naming speed and orthographic processing. We administered measures of general
      cognitive ability, phonological awareness, orthographic processing, short-term
      memory, rapid automatized naming, auditory and visual processing, and reading
      fluency to 21 Grade 6 children with dyslexia, 21 chronological age-matched
      controls and 20 Grade 3 reading age-matched controls. The results indicated that 
      the children with dyslexia did not experience auditory processing deficits, but
      about half of them showed visual processing deficits. Both orthographic
      processing and rapid automatized naming deficits were associated with dyslexia in
      our sample, but it is less clear that they were associated with visual processing
      deficits.

PG  - 188-92
AB  - Several studies have shown that a phonological deficit is the origin of
      developmental dyslexia, because dyslexics have important difficulties in mapping 
      orthographic to phonological codes. However, visual criteria are still used for
      the diagnosis of dyslexia and to develop methods of intervention. This study
      attempts to determine whether there are visual problems in dyslexic children. To 
      this aim, dyslexic children and children without reading difficulties, matched by
      chronological age, participated in two experiments. One study was based on the
      Reversal test and the other was a visual decision task in which participants had 
      to decide whether two letters were the same or different. There were 40 pairs of 
      letters, to measure reaction times and mistakes. The results showed that
      dyslexics had similar performance to controls in the detection of different
      visual stimuli. Developmental dyslexics do not appear to have visual perceptual
      problems, but a particular difficulty to retrieve the phonological code of
      graphemes.

      during German vowel length discrimination: an fMRI study.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2011.12.003 [doi]
AB  - This fMRI study investigated phonological vs. auditory temporal processing in
      developmental dyslexia by means of a German vowel length discrimination paradigm 
      (Groth, Lachmann, Riecker, Muthmann, & Steinbrink, 2011). Behavioral and fMRI
      data were collected from dyslexics and controls while performing same-different
      judgments of vowel duration in two experimental conditions. In the temporal, but 
      not in the phonological condition, hemodynamic brain activation was observed
      bilaterally within the anterior insular cortices in both groups and within the
      left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in controls, indicating that the left IFG and
      the anterior insular cortices are part of a neural network involved in temporal
      auditory processing. Group subtraction analyses did not demonstrate significant
      effects. However, in a subgroup analysis, participants performing low in the
      temporal condition (all dyslexic) showed decreased activation of the insular
      cortices and the left IFG, suggesting that this processing network might form the
      neural basis of temporal auditory processing deficits in dyslexia.

AB  - Phonological awareness, knowledge that speech is composed of syllables and
      phonemes, is critical for learning to read. Phonological awareness precedes and
      predicts successful transition from language to literacy, and weakness in
      phonological awareness is a leading cause of dyslexia, but the brain basis of
      phonological awareness for spoken language in children is unknown. We used
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates of
      phonological awareness using an auditory word-rhyming task in children who were
      typical readers or who had dyslexia (ages 7-13) and a younger group of
      kindergarteners (ages 5-6). Typically developing children, but not children with 
      dyslexia, recruited left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when making
      explicit phonological judgments. Kindergarteners, who were matched to the older
      children with dyslexia on standardized tests of phonological awareness, also
      recruited left DLPFC. Left DLPFC may play a critical role in the development of
      phonological awareness for spoken language critical for reading and in the
      etiology of dyslexia.

PG  - 466-76
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.10.004 [doi]
AB  - According to wide literature, a global impairment in the temporal and spatial
      domains as well as an increased crowding effect is common of dyslexics. The aim
      of the study was to evaluate if such subjects suffer from a more general
      impairment of spatial relationship perception (SRP) and in particular from
      anomalous spatial relationship anisotropy (SRA) thus accounting both for their
      global perceptual distortions and abnormal crowding. SRP of 39 young disabled
      readers and 23 normal subjects were measured by a specifically designed
      psychophysical technique based on circular and elliptical target recognitions. A 
      general impairment of SRP characterized by increased horizontal/vertical
      anisotropy was found in the dyslexic sample compared to the controls. In the
      second part of the experiment, reading efficiency and reading time were measured 
      by MNREAD((c)) reading cards in standard conditions and after increasing
      horizontal spatial extension of the sentence by different values. We suppose this
      modification could well compensate the abnormal anisotropy found in dyslexics.
      Data obtained in the two groups were compared. A strong correlation between
      reading efficiency (a parameter we have specifically devised) and horizontal
      spatial text relationship values were present in the patients (r=.87, p<.01), but
      not in the controls. The same was found taking into consideration mean reading
      time (r=-.82, p<.01). We therefore gather that an alteration of SRP,
      characterized by an increased anisotropy may be involved in developmental
      dyslexia.

PG  - 705-11

AB  - PURPOSE: Children with rolandic epilepsy (RE) experience difficulties with
      reading, language, and attention. Their siblings are at high risk of dyslexia but
      are not otherwise known to have neurocognitive deficits. We therefore sought
      evidence for an RE-associated neurocognitive endophenotype. METHODS: Thirteen
      probands (male-to-female ratio 9:4) and 11 epilepsy-free siblings (male-to-female
      ratio 5:6) completed a neurocognitive evaluation within the domains of reading,
      language, and attention. Frequencies of impairment were compared, and mean
      standardized scores of children with RE and their siblings were each compared
      against population means. KEY FINDINGS: Frequency of impairment in each domain
      was comparable for siblings and probands: 9% of siblings and 31% of probands were
      reading impaired; 36% of siblings and 54% of probands were language impaired; and
      70% of siblings and 67% of probands had attention impairments. Comparison of
      differences between sample and population means revealed evidence of a similar
      pattern of language deficits in both groups, specifically for picture naming and 
      attention to competing words. For measures of attention, both groups made
      significantly higher omission errors and were impaired in their ability to
      sustain attention. SIGNIFICANCE: Children with RE and unaffected siblings
      demonstrate neurocognitive impairments in the domains of language and attention
      that are likely to remain undetected with general clinical protocols.
      Neurocognitively impaired probands and siblings showed a remarkably similar
      profile of deficits in language and attention that could explain poor academic
      performance. Early evaluation and intervention may benefit these children
      academically.

TI  - The rs3743205 SNP is important for the regulation of the dyslexia candidate gene 
      DYX1C1 by estrogen receptor beta and DNA methylation.
PG  - 619-29
LID - 10.1210/me.2011-1376 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen is involved in numerous physiological processes such as growth,
      differentiation, and function of the male and female reproductive tissues. In the
      developing brain, estrogen signaling has been linked to cognitive functions, such
      as learning and memory; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this
      phenomenon are poorly understood. We have previously shown a link between
      developmental dyslexia and estrogen signaling, when we studied the functional
      interactions between the dyslexia candidate protein DYX1C1 and the estrogen
      receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta). Here, we investigate the
      17beta-estradiol (E2)-dependent regulation of dyslexia susceptibility 1 candidate
      1 (DYX1C1) expression. We demonstrate that ERbeta, not ERalpha, binds to a
      transcriptionally active cis-regulatory region upstream of DYX1C1 transcriptional
      start site and that DYX1C1 expression is enhanced by E2 in a neuroblastoma cell
      line. This regulation is dependent on transcription factor II-I and liganded
      ERbeta recruitment to this region. In addition, we describe that a single
      nucleotide polymorphism previously shown to be associated with dyslexia and
      located in the cis-regulatory region of DYX1C1 may alter the epigenetic and
      endocrine regulation of this gene. Our data provide important molecular insights 
      into the relationship between developmental dyslexia susceptibility and estrogen 
      signaling.

      representations in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 640-54
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.01.001 [doi]
AB  - In transparent orthographies, like German, children with developmental dyslexia
      (DD) are mainly characterized by a reading fluency deficit. The reading fluency
      deficit might be traced back to a scarce integration of orthographic and
      phonological representations. In order to address this question, the present
      study used EEG to investigate the N300, an ERP component which has been
      associated with the integration of orthographic and phonological representations.
      Twenty children without DD and 18 children with DD performed a phonological
      (P)-orthographic (O) matching task (P-O condition), which tapped the integration 
      of orthographic and phonological representations. A control task was applied
      which did not require the integration of orthographic and phonological
      representations and consisted only of orthographic information (O-O condition).
      The O-O condition revealed a similar N300 distribution between groups with a
      bilateral activity over fronto-temporal electrodes. However, in the P-O condition
      N300 differentiated the 2 groups of children. The control group revealed greater 
      activity over left fronto-temporal electrodes, whereas the N300 was distributed
      bilaterally in the group of children with DD suggesting deficient integration of 
      orthographic and phonological representations. These findings might be related to
      the reading fluency deficit as it was also observed that better reading fluency
      was correlated with higher (r=-.36) and earlier peaking (r=-.33) N300 amplitudes 
      in the left hemisphere and attenuated N300 amplitudes (r=.45) in the right
      hemisphere. Standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography analysis
      (sLORETA) revealed that children with DD rely more on right temporo-parietal
      brain areas compared to children without DD. Furthermore, in order to rule out
      that earlier deficient processes might influence the group differences found in
      the N300, we analyzed the N170 for group differences. We did not find significant
      differences between children without DD and children with DD. In conclusion the
      results suggest deficient integration of orthographic and phonological
      representations in dyslexia, as indexed by the N300, and further highlight how
      this activity is relevant for fluent reading.

TI  - [Molecular genetics of functional articulation disorder in children].
PG  - 316-20
AB  - Genetic factors are an important cause of functional articulation disorder in
      children. This article reviews some genes and chromosome regions associated with 
      a genetic susceptibility to functional articulation disorders. The forkhead box
      P2 (FOXP2) gene on chromosome 7 is introduced in details including its structure,
      expression and function. The relationship between the FOXP2 gene and
      developmental apraxia of speech is discussed. As a transcription factor, FOXP2
      gene regulates the expression of many genes. CNTNAP2 as an important target gene 
      of FOXP2 is a key gene influencing language development. Functional articulation 
      disorder may be developed to dyslexia, therefore some candidate regions and genes
      related to dyslexia, such as 3p12-13, 15q11-21, 6p22 and 1p34-36, are also
      introduced. ROBO1 gene in 3p12.3, ZNF280D gene, TCF12 gene, EKN1 gene in 15q21,
      and KIAA0319 gene in 6p22 have been candidate genes for the study of functional
      articulation disorder.

TI  - Impaired non-speech auditory processing at a pre-reading age is a risk-factor for
      dyslexia but not a predictor: An ERP study.
AB  - Impaired auditory sensitivity to amplitude rise time (ART) has been suggested to 
      be a primary deficit in developmental dyslexia. The present study investigates
      whether impaired ART-sensitivity at a pre-reading age precedes and predicts later
      emerging reading problems in a sample of Dutch children. An oddball paradigm,
      with a deviant that differed from the standard stimulus in ART, was administered 
      to 41-month-old children (30 genetically at-risk for developmental dyslexia and
      14 controls) with concurrent EEG measurement. A second deviant that differed from
      the standard stimulus in frequency served as a control deviant. Grade two reading
      scores were used to divide the at-risks in a typical-reading and a dyslexic
      subgroup. We found that both ART- and frequency processing were related to later 
      reading skill. We however also found that irrespective of reading level, the
      at-risks in general showed impaired basic auditory processing when compared to
      controls and that it was impossible to discriminate between the at-risk groups on
      basis of both auditory measures. A relatively higher quality of early expressive 
      syntactic skills in the typical-reading at-risk group might indicate a protective
      factor against negative effects of impaired auditory processing on reading
      development. Based on these results we argue that ART- and frequency-processing
      measures, although they are related to reading skill, lack the power to be
      considered single-cause predictors of developmental dyslexia. More likely, they
      are genetically driven risk factors that may add to cumulative effects on
      processes that are critical for learning to read.

TI  - Neural dissociation of phonological and visual attention span disorders in
      developmental dyslexia: FMRI evidence from two case reports.
PG  - 381-94
LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2011.12.015 [doi]
AB  - A dissociation between phonological and visual attention (VA) span disorders has 
      been reported in dyslexic children. This study investigates whether this
      cognitively-based dissociation has a neurobiological counterpart through the
      investigation of two cases of developmental dyslexia. LL showed a phonological
      disorder but preserved VA span whereas FG exhibited the reverse pattern. During a
      phonological rhyme judgement task, LL showed decreased activation of the left
      inferior frontal gyrus whereas this region was activated at the level of the
      controls in FG. Conversely, during a visual categorization task, FG demonstrated 
      decreased activation of the parietal lobules whereas these regions were activated
      in LL as in the controls. These contrasted patterns of brain activation thus
      mirror the cognitive disorders' dissociation. These findings provide the first
      evidence for an association between distinct brain mechanisms and distinct
      cognitive deficits in developmental dyslexia, emphasizing the importance of
      taking into account the heterogeneity of the reading disorder.

TI  - Global and local pitch perception in children with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 265-70
LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2011.12.002 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated global versus local pitch pattern perception in children 
      with dyslexia aged between 8 and 11 years. Children listened to two consecutive
      4-tone pitch sequences while performing a same/different task. On the different
      trials, sequences either preserved the contour (local condition) or they violated
      the contour (global condition). Compared to normally developing children,
      dyslexics showed robust pitch perception deficits in the local but not the global
      condition. This finding was replicated in a simple pitch direction task, which
      minimizes sequencing and short term memory. Results are consistent with a
      left-hemisphere deficit in dyslexia because local pitch changes are supposedly
      processed by the left hemisphere, whereas global pitch changes are processed by
      the right hemisphere. The present data suggest a link between impaired pitch
      processing and abnormal phonological development in children with dyslexia, which
      makes pitch pattern processing a potent tool for early diagnosis and remediation 
      of dyslexia.

LID - 10.1037/a0025660 [doi]
AB  - Parameters of a formal working-memory model were estimated for verbal and spatial
      memory updating of children. The model proposes interference though feature
      overwriting and through confusion of whole elements as the primary cause of
      working-memory capacity limits. We tested 2 age groups each containing 1 group of
      normal intelligence and 1 deficit group. For young children the deficit was
      developmental dyslexia; for older children it was a general learning difficulty. 
      The interference model predicts less interference through overwriting but more
      through confusion of whole elements for the dyslexic children than for their
      age-matched controls. Older children exhibited less interference through
      confusion of whole elements and a higher processing rate than young children, but
      general learning difficulty was associated with slower processing than in the
      age-matched control group. Furthermore, the difference between verbal and spatial
      updating mapped onto several meaningful dissociations of model parameters.

TI  - Rhythmogram-based analysis for continuous electrographic data of the human brain.
PG  - 205-11
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2011.2170217 [doi]
AB  - Ecologically relevant stimuli are rarely used in scientific studies because they 
      are difficult to control. Instead, researchers employ simple stimuli with sharp
      boundaries (in space and time). Here, we explore how the rhythmogram can be used 
      to provide much needed rigorous control of natural continuous stimuli like music 
      and speech. The analysis correlates important features in the time course of
      stimuli with corresponding features in brain activations elicited by the same
      stimuli. Correlating the identified regularities of the stimulus time course with
      the features extracted from the activations of each voxel of a tomographic
      analysis of brain activity provides a powerful view of how different brain
      regions are influenced by the stimulus at different times and over different
      (user-selected) timescales. The application of the analysis to tomographic
      solutions extracted from magnetoencephalographic data recorded while subjects
      listen to music reveals a surprising and aesthetically pleasing aspect of brain
      function: an area believed to be specialized for visual processing is recruited
      to analyze the music after the acoustic signal is transformed to a feature map.
      The methodology is ideal for exploring processing of complex stimuli, e.g.,
      linguistic structure and meaning and how it fails, for example, in developmental 
      dyslexia.

TI  - Time-Resolved and Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Complex Cognitive Processes and
      their Role in Disorders like Developmental Dyscalculia.
PG  - 81-96
AB  - The aim of this article is to report on the importance and challenges of a
      time-resolved and spatio-temporal analysis of fMRI data from complex cognitive
      processes and associated disorders using a study on developmental dyscalculia
      (DD). Participants underwent fMRI while judging the incorrectness of
      multiplication results, and the data were analyzed using a sequence of methods,
      each of which progressively provided more a detailed picture of the
      spatio-temporal aspect of this disease. Healthy subjects and subjects with DD
      performed alike behaviorally though they exhibited parietal disparities using
      traditional voxel-based group analyses. Further and more detailed differences,
      however, surfaced with a time-resolved examination of the neural responses during
      the experiment. While performing inter-group comparisons, a third group of
      subjects with dyslexia (DL) but with no arithmetic difficulties was included to
      test the specificity of the analysis and strengthen the statistical base with
      overall fifty-eight subjects. Surprisingly, the analysis showed a functional
      dissimilarity during an initial reading phase for the group of dyslexic but
      otherwise normal subjects, with respect to controls, even though only numerical
      digits and no alphabetic characters were presented. Thus our results suggest that
      time-resolved multi-variate analysis of complex experimental paradigms has the
      ability to yield powerful new clinical insights about abnormal brain function.
      Similarly, a detailed compilation of aberrations in the functional cascade may
      have much greater potential to delineate the core processing problems in mental
      disorders.

TI  - Language development in Japanese children who receive cochlear implant and/or
      hearing aid.
PG  - 433-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.12.027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate a wide variety of factors that
      influence auditory, speech, and language development following pediatric cochlear
      implantation (CI). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective collection of language tested data
      in profound hearing-impaired children. HYPOTHESIS: Pediatric CI can potentially
      be effective to development of practical communication skills and early
      implantation is more effective. METHODS: We proposed a set of language tests
      (assessment package of the language development for Japanese hearing-impaired
      children; ALADJIN) consisting of communication skills testing (test for
      question-answer interaction development; TQAID), comprehensive (Peabody Picture
      Vocabulary Test-Revised; PVT-R and Standardized Comprehension Test for Abstract
      Words; SCTAW) and productive vocabulary (Word Fluency Test; WFT), and
      comprehensive and productive syntax (Syntactic processing Test for Aphasia; STA).
      Of 638 hearing-impaired children recruited for this study, 282 (44.2%) with >70
      dB hearing impairment had undergone CI. After excluding children with low birth
      weight (<1800 g), those with >11 points on the Pervasive Developmental Disorder
      ASJ Rating Scale for the test of autistic tendency, and those <2 SD on Raven's
      Colored Progressive Matrices for the test of non-verbal intelligence, 190
      children were subjected to this set of language tests. RESULTS: Sixty children
      (31.6%) were unilateral CI-only users, 128 (67.4%) were CI-hearing aid (HA)
      users, and 2 (1.1%) were bilateral CI users. Hearing loss level of CI users was
      significantly (p<0.01) worse than that of HA-only users. However, the threshold
      level, maximum speech discrimination score, and speech intelligibility rating in 
      CI users were significantly (p<0.01) better than those in HA-only users. The
      scores for PVT-R (p<0.01), SCTAW, and WFT in CI users were better than those in
      HA-only users. STA and TQAID scores in CI-HA users were significantly (p<0.05)
      better than those in unilateral CI-only users. The high correlation (r=0.52) has 
      been found between the age of CI and maximum speech discrimination score. The
      scores of speech and language tests in the implanted children before 24 months of
      age have been better than those in the implanted children after 24 months of age.
      CONCLUSIONS: We could indicate that CI was effective for language development in 
      Japanese hearing-impaired children and early CI was more effective for productive
      vocabulary and syntax.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading
      disability commonly co-occur because of shared genetic risk factors. However, the
      stability and change of these genetic influences and the predictive relationships
      underlying this association longitudinally remain unclear. METHODS: ADHD symptoms
      and reading were assessed as continuous dimensions in a UK general population
      sample of approximately 7,000 twin pairs. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms and
      teacher ratings of reading were obtained at two ages: middle childhood (ages 7-8 
      years) and early adolescence (ages 11-12 years). Cross-lagged quantitative
      genetic analyses were applied. RESULTS: ADHD symptoms and reading significantly
      predicted each other over time. However, ADHD symptoms were a significantly
      stronger predictor of reading than vice versa. Inattentive and
      hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of ADHD both contributed to the prediction of
      reading, but inattentiveness was a significantly stronger predictor. Furthermore,
      ADHD symptoms and reading were highly heritable, and their association was
      primarily attributable to shared genetic influences. Despite notable genetic
      innovation for each trait, genetic factors involved in the association of ADHD
      symptoms and reading over time were highly stable. CONCLUSIONS: ADHD symptoms may
      put children at increased risk for reading problems and vice versa. Moreover,
      enduring genetic mechanisms appear to be important in the association of ADHD
      symptoms and reading over time.

TI  - A follow-up study on word and non-word reading skills in Down syndrome.
PG  - 121-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jcomdis.2011.11.001 [doi]
AB  - The current study was designed to trace changes in the relationship between
      non-word reading and irregular word reading on the one hand, and between
      phonological awareness and non-word reading on the other, through a follow-up
      study of a group of individuals with Down syndrome. Twelve individuals with Down 
      syndrome, whose data were originally reported in Roch and Jarrold (2008), were
      seen four years later, and were given the same tasks as in the previous study
      evaluating phonological awareness, non-word reading and irregular word reading.
      After four years, an improvement was observed in all the skills of interest.
      Furthermore, the pattern of relationships among the three skills was observed to 
      change considerably across the four year period. At the first time point, a weak 
      association between non-word and irregular word reading was found, but there was 
      a strong association between these two measures at the second time point. In
      contrast, a strong relationship was found at Time 1 between non-word reading and 
      phonological awareness, which became weaker at Time 2. Longitudinal associations 
      between the three skills were also examined in order to explain this changing
      pattern of associations. The results indicated that the ability to decode
      non-words plays a marginal role on later irregular word reading. In contrast,
      irregular word reading is a longitudinal predictor of later non-word reading.
      Phonological awareness was not longitudinally related to non-word reading. The
      results indicate that developing word knowledge can facilitate later non-word
      reading in Down syndrome, perhaps by a process of reading by visual analogy to
      known lexical items. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (a) explain the
      development of word reading, non-word reading and phonological awareness in Down 
      syndrome; (b) explain the longitudinal changes in the relationships among the
      three skills; (c) explain the relevance for education of the influence of word
      reading for the improvement in non-word reading.

TI  - The Influence of Pathologies upon Sensory Perception and Sensory Coordination in 
      Children with Developmental Dyslexia and Learning Disorders: A Unified Theory of 
      Developmental Dyslexia.
PG  - 109-16
LID - 10.4103/1947-2714.93878 [doi]
AB  - This case is presented to explain that developmental dyslexia and related
      autistic spectrum disorders have solely pathological origins. There is a general 
      consensus of opinion which supports the phonological theory. However, this
      largely ignores the biological basis for all aspects of the brain's development
      and function, and hence, for its dysfunction. A unified explanation must take
      into account all salient features including cognitive dysfunction, encephalograph
      (EEG) frequencies, neural networks, physiological systems, autonomic nervous
      system and the function of the cerebellum. It must explain the significance of
      the brain waves and neurons and their normally synchronized or coherent function.
      This article builds upon an earlier article by the authors, which incorporates a 
      review and discussion of the prevailing theories or models for developmental
      dyslexia. It looks at the issues from a top-down 'systems biology' perspective.
      It concludes that it may be only the body's biochemistry and, in particular, the 
      onset of pathologies that explain the phenomena which we recognize as
      developmental dyslexia. Pathologies experienced in the early prepubescent years
      influence neural development. They influence the speed and coherent transmission 
      of data between the senses and neural centers. It is proposed that this explains 
      the nature and occurrence of what we recognize as developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Functional characteristics of developmental dyslexia in left-hemispheric
      posterior brain regions predate reading onset.
PG  - 2156-61
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1107721109 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD) show a disruption in posterior
      left-hemispheric neural networks during phonological processing. Additionally,
      compensatory mechanisms in children and adults with DD have been located within
      frontal brain areas. However, it remains unclear when and how differences in
      posterior left-hemispheric networks manifest and whether compensatory mechanisms 
      have already started to develop in the prereading brain. Here we investigate
      functional networks during phonological processing in 36 prereading children with
      a familial risk for DD (n = 18, average age = 66.50 mo) compared with age and
      IQ-matched controls (n = 18; average age = 65.61 mo). Functional neuroimaging
      results reveal reduced activation in prereading children with a family-history of
      DD (FHD(+)), compared with those without (FHD(-)), in bilateral occipitotemporal 
      and left temporoparietal brain regions. This finding corresponds to previously
      identified hypoactivations in left hemispheric posterior brain regions for
      school-aged children and adults with a diagnosis of DD. Furthermore, left
      occipitotemporal and temporoparietal brain activity correlates positively with
      prereading skills in both groups. Our results suggest that differences in neural 
      correlates of phonological processing in individuals with DD are not a result of 
      reading failure, but are present before literacy acquisition starts.
      Additionally, no hyperactivation in frontal brain regions was observed,
      suggesting that compensatory mechanisms for reading failure are not yet present. 
      Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether the identified
      differences may serve as neural premarkers for the early identification of
      children at risk for DD.

TI  - Association of polymorphisms in the DCDC2 gene with developmental dyslexia in the
      Han Chinese.
PG  - 622-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic association studies on populations of European origin have
      identified the DCDC2 gene as a susceptibility locus for developmental dyslexia.
      Here, we sought to investigate the association of DCDC2 polymorphisms with
      developmental dyslexia in children of Han Chinese origin. METHODS: We undertook a
      case-control genetic association study on 76 dyslexic children and 79
      non-dyslexic matched controls. We isolated DNA from oral mucosal cell samples and
      genotyped two DCDC2 coding-sequence single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2274305
      and rs6456593, in each sample using SNaPshot single nucleotide extension. We
      compared the allele and genotype frequencies between the groups using the chi(2) 
      test and analyzed the relationship between dyslexia and the polymorphism at both 
      loci using unconditional logistic regression. We also predicted haplotypes and
      compared their frequencies between the two groups. RESULTS: The differences in
      the genotype distribution and the allelic genes of the two single nucleotide luci
      of the DCDC2 gene, rs2274305 and rs6456593, between the two dyslexic and
      non-dyslexic groups were statistically meaningless (P > 0.05). The differences in
      the haplotype distributions of the DCDC2 gene between the dyslexic and normal
      group were statistically meaningless (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The DCDC2 gene may
      not be a susceptibility factor for developmental dyslexia among the Han Chinese. 
      However, methodological issues may have prevented the detection of positive
      associations.

      the presence of dyslexia among a group of high-risk Chinese children.
PG  - 40-57
LID - 10.1002/dys.1434 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to examine factors that are predictive of future developmental 
      dyslexia among a group of 5-year-old Chinese children at risk for dyslexia,
      including 62 children with a sibling who had been previously diagnosed with
      dyslexia and 52 children who manifested clinical at-risk factors in aspects of
      language according to testing by paediatricians. The age-5 performances on
      various literacy and cognitive tasks, gender and group status (familial risk or
      language delayed) were used to predict developmental dyslexia 2 years later using
      logistic regression analysis. Results showed that greater risk of dyslexia was
      related to slower rapid automatized naming, lower scores on morphological
      awareness, Chinese character recognition and English letter naming, and gender
      (boys had more risk). Three logistic equations were generated for estimating
      individual risk of dyslexia. The strongest models were those that included all
      print-related variables (including speeded number naming, character recognition
      and letter identification) and gender, with about 70% accuracy or above. Early
      identification of those Chinese children at risk for dyslexia can facilitate
      better dyslexia risk management.

AB  - Long-standing issues with the conceptualization, identification and subtyping of 
      developmental dyslexia persist. This study takes an alternative approach to
      examine the heterogeneity of developmental dyslexia using taxometric
      classification techniques. These methods were used with a large sample of 671
      children ages 6-8 who were diagnosed with severe reading disorders. Latent
      characteristics of the sample are assessed in regard to posited subtypes with
      phonological deficits and naming speed deficits, thus extending prior work by
      addressing whether these deficits embody separate classes of individuals.
      Findings support separate taxa of dyslexia with and without phonological
      deficits. Different latent structure for naming speed deficits was found
      depending on the definitional criterion used to define dyslexia.
      Non-phonologically based forms of dyslexia showed particular difficulty with
      naming speed and reading fluency.

TI  - Imaging genetics of FOXP2 in dyslexia.
PG  - 224-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2011.160 [doi]
AB  - Dyslexia is a developmental disorder characterised by extensive difficulties in
      the acquisition of reading or spelling. Genetic influence is estimated at 50-70%.
      However, the link between genetic variants and phenotypic deficits is largely
      unknown. Our aim was to investigate a role of genetic variants of FOXP2, a
      prominent speech and language gene, in dyslexia using imaging genetics. This
      technique combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and genetics to
      investigate relevance of genetic variants on brain activation. To our knowledge, 
      this represents the first usage of fMRI-based imaging genetics in dyslexia. In an
      initial case/control study (n = 245) for prioritisation of FOXP2 polymorphisms
      for later use in imaging genetics, nine SNPs were selected. A non-synonymously
      coding mutation involved in verbal dyspraxia was also investigated. SNP
      rs12533005 showed nominally significant association with dyslexia (genotype GG
      odds ratio recessive model = 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.1-3.9), P = 0.016). A
      correlated SNP was associated with altered expression of FOXP2 in vivo in human
      hippocampal tissue. Therefore, influence of the rs12533005-G risk variant on
      brain activity was studied. fMRI revealed a significant main effect for the
      factor 'genetic risk' in a temporo-parietal area involved in phonological
      processing as well as a significant interaction effect between the factors
      'disorder' and 'genetic risk' in activation of inferior frontal brain areas.
      Hence, our data may hint at a role of FOXP2 genetic variants in dyslexia-specific
      brain activation and demonstrate use of imaging genetics in dyslexia research.

AB  - Family history and poor preliteracy skills (referred to here as familial and
      behavioral risk, respectively) are critical predictors of developmental dyslexia.
      This study systematically investigated the independent contribution of familial
      and behavioral risks on brain structures, which had not been explored in past
      studies. We also examined the differential effects of maternal versus paternal
      history on brain morphometry, and familial risk dimensionally versus
      categorically, which were also novel aspects of the study. We assessed 51
      children (5 to 6 years of age) with varying degrees of familial and behavioral
      risks for developmental dyslexia and examined associations with brain
      morphometry. We found that greater maternal history of reading disability was
      associated with smaller bilateral prefrontal and parieto-temporal gray, but not
      white matter volumes. Regressing out behavioral risk, socioeconomic status, and
      maternal education and other confounds did not change the results. No such
      relationship was observed for paternal reading history and behavioral risk.
      Results of cortical surface area and thickness further showed that there was a
      significant negative relationship between cortical surface area (but not
      thickness) and greater severity of maternal history, in particular within the
      left inferior parietal lobule, suggesting prenatal influence of maternal history 
      on children's brain morphometry. The results suggested greater maternal, possibly
      prenatal, influence on language-related brain structures. These results help to
      guide future neuroimaging research focusing on environmental and genetic
      influences and provide new information that may help predict which child will
      develop dyslexia in the future.

AB  - Perception of speech at multiple temporal scales is important for the efficient
      extraction of meaningful phonological elements. Individuals with developmental
      dyslexia have difficulty in the accurate neural representation of phonological
      aspects of speech, across languages. Recently, it was proposed that these
      difficulties might arise in part because of impaired phase locking to the slower 
      modulations in the speech signal (<10 Hz), which would affect syllabic parsing
      and segmentation of the speech stream (the "temporal sampling" hypothesis,
      Goswami, 2011). Here we measured MEG responses to different rates of amplitude
      modulated white noise in adults with and without dyslexia. In line with the
      temporal sampling hypothesis, different patterns of phase locking to amplitude
      modulation at the delta rate of 2 Hz were found when comparing participants with 
      dyslexia to typically-reading participants. Typical readers exhibited better
      phase locking to slow modulations in right auditory cortex, whereas adults with
      dyslexia showed more bilateral phase locking. The results suggest that
      oscillatory phase locking mechanisms for slower temporal modulations are atypical
      in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - DCDC2 genetic variants and susceptibility to developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 25-30
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e32834acdb2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): Developmental dyslexia is a heritable condition, with genetic
      factors accounting for 44-75% of the variance in performance tests of reading
      component subphenotypes. Compelling genetic linkage and association evidence
      supports a quantitative trait locus in the 6p21.3 region that encodes a gene
      called DCDC2. In this study, we explored the contribution of two DCDC2 markers to
      dyslexia, related reading and memory phenotypes in nuclear families of Italian
      origin. METHODS: The 303 nuclear families recruited on the basis of having a
      proband with developmental dyslexia have been studied with 6p21.3 markers,
      BV677278 and rs793862. Marker-trait association was investigated by the
      quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (version 2.5.1) that allows for the
      analyses of quantitative traits. Seven phenotypes were used in association
      analyses, that is, word and nonword reading, word and nonword spelling,
      orthographic choice, memory, and the affected status based on inclusion criteria.
      RESULTS: Quantitative transmission disequilibrium test analyses yielded evidence 
      for association between reading skills and the BV677278 deletion (empirical
      P-values=0.025-0.029) and between memory and BV677278 allele 10 (empirical
      P-value=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our result adds further evidence in support of DCDC2
      contributing to the deficits in developmental dyslexia. More specifically, our
      data support the view that DCDC2 influences both reading and memory impairments
      thus shedding further light into the etiologic basis and the phenotypic
      complexity of developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Genetic variants of FOXP2 and KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 locus are associated with
      altered brain activation in distinct language-related regions.
PG  - 817-25
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5996-10.2012 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances have been made in the genetics of two human communication skills:
      speaking and reading. Mutations of the FOXP2 gene cause a severe form of language
      impairment and orofacial dyspraxia, while single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      located within a KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 gene cluster and affecting the KIAA0319
      gene expression are associated with reading disability. Neuroimaging studies of
      clinical populations point to partially distinct cerebral bases for language and 
      reading impairments. However, alteration of FOXP2 and KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2
      polymorphisms on typically developed language networks has never been explored.
      Here, we genotyped and scanned 94 healthy subjects using fMRI during a reading
      task. We studied the correlation of genetic polymorphisms with interindividual
      variability in brain activation and functional asymmetry in frontal and temporal 
      cortices. In FOXP2, SNPs rs6980093 and rs7799109 were associated with variations 
      of activation in the left frontal cortex. In the KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 locus,
      rs17243157 was associated with asymmetry in functional activation of the superior
      temporal sulcus (STS). Interestingly, healthy subjects bearing the
      KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 variants previously identified as enhancing the risk of
      dyslexia showed a reduced left-hemispheric asymmetry of the STS. Our results
      confirm that both FOXP2 and KIAA0319/TTRAP/THEM2 genes play an important role in 
      human language development, but probably through different cerebral pathways. The
      observed cortical effects mirror previous fMRI results in developmental language 
      and reading disorders, and suggest that a continuum may exist between these
      pathologies and normal interindividual variability.

AB  - The general goal of the study was to identify global and specific components in
      developmental dyslexia using various manipulations based on the rapid
      automatization paradigm (RAN). In two experiments, we used both factor analysis
      and the Rate-and-Amount Model to verify if one (or more) global factor(s) and a
      variety of specific effects contribute to the naming (and visual search) deficits
      in children with dyslexia. Results of Experiment 1 indicated the presence of
      three global components: pictorial naming, detailed orthographic analysis, and
      visual search. Pictorial naming is predicated by typical RAN tasks (such as
      naming colors or objects), independent of set size, but also from a variety of
      other tasks including Stroop interference conditions. The detailed orthographic
      analysis factor accounts for naming of orthographic stimuli at high set size.
      Visual search marked tasks requiring the scanning of visual targets. Results of
      Experiment 2 confirmed the separation between the pictorial naming and detailed
      orthographic analysis factors both in the original sample and in a new group of
      children. Furthermore, specific effects of frequency, lexicality, and length were
      shown to contribute to the reading deficit. Overall, it is proposed that focusing
      on the profile of both global and specific effects provides a more effective and,
      at the same time, simpler account of the dyslexics' impairment.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: the difficulties of interpreting poor performance, and
      the importance of normal performance.
PG  - 104-22
AB  - This paper provides a selective review of data on phonology, audition, vision,
      and learning abilities in developmental dyslexia, with a specific focus on
      patterns of normal alongside poor performance. Indeed we highlight the
      difficulties of interpreting poor performance, and we criticize theories of
      dyslexia that are exclusively suited to explaining poor performance, at the risk 
      of overgeneralizing and predicting deficits in many more situations than are
      observed. We highlight a number of tasks and conditions where individuals with
      dyslexia seem to show perfectly normal performance, and we discuss the value of
      taking such data seriously into account and the difficulties of current theories 
      to explain them. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges for tasks
      investigating the nature of cognitive deficits in dyslexia and in other
      developmental disorders and the challenges for any proper theory of dyslexia
      aiming to explain cases of normal as well as poor performance.

AB  - We examined whether developmental dyslexic adults suffer from sluggish
      attentional shifting (SAS; Hari and Renvall in Trends Cogn Sci 5:525-532, 2001)
      by measuring their shifting of attention in a visual search task with dynamic
      cluttered displays (Van der Burg et al. in J Exp Psychol Human 34:1053-1065,
      2008). Dyslexics were generally slower than normal readers in searching a
      horizontal or vertical target among oblique distracters. However, the addition of
      a click sound presented in synchrony with a color change of the target
      drastically improved their performance up to the level of the normal readers.
      These results are in line with the idea that developmental dyslexics have
      specific problems in disengaging attention from the current fixation, and that
      the phasic alerting by a sound can compensate for this deficit.

AB  - This mini-review summarizes and integrates findings from recent meta-analyses and
      original neuroimaging studies on functional brain abnormalities in dyslexic
      readers. Surprisingly, there is little empirical support for the standard
      neuroanatomical model of developmental dyslexia, which localizes the primary
      phonological decoding deficit in left temporo-parietal (TP) regions. Rather,
      recent evidence points to a dysfunction of a left hemisphere reading network,
      which includes occipito-temporal (OT), inferior frontal, and inferior parietal
      regions.

AB  - Auditory cortical oscillations have been proposed to play an important role in
      speech perception. It is suggested that the brain may take temporal "samples" of 
      information from the speech stream at different rates, phase resetting ongoing
      oscillations so that they are aligned with similar frequency bands in the input
      ("phase locking"). Information from these frequency bands is then bound together 
      for speech perception. To date, there are no explorations of neural phase locking
      and entrainment to speech input in children. However, it is clear from studies of
      language acquisition that infants use both visual speech information and auditory
      speech information in learning. In order to study neural entrainment to speech in
      typically developing children, we use a rhythmic entrainment paradigm (underlying
      2 Hz or delta rate) based on repetition of the syllable "ba," presented in either
      the auditory modality alone, the visual modality alone, or as auditory-visual
      speech (via a "talking head"). To ensure attention to the task, children aged 13 
      years were asked to press a button as fast as possible when the "ba" stimulus
      violated the rhythm for each stream type. Rhythmic violation depended on delaying
      the occurrence of a "ba" in the isochronous stream. Neural entrainment was
      demonstrated for all stream types, and individual differences in standardized
      measures of language processing were related to auditory entrainment at the theta
      rate. Further, there was significant modulation of the preferred phase of
      auditory entrainment in the theta band when visual speech cues were present,
      indicating cross-modal phase resetting. The rhythmic entrainment paradigm
      developed here offers a method for exploring individual differences in
      oscillatory phase locking during development. In particular, a method for
      assessing neural entrainment and cross-modal phase resetting would be useful for 
      exploring developmental learning difficulties thought to involve temporal
      sampling, such as dyslexia.

LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00154 [doi]
AB  - The ability to identify letters and encode their position is a crucial step of
      the word recognition process. However and despite their word identification
      problem, the ability of dyslexic children to encode letter identity and
      letter-position within strings was not systematically investigated. This study
      aimed at filling this gap and further explored how letter identity and
      letter-position encoding is modulated by letter context in developmental
      dyslexia. For this purpose, a letter-string comparison task was administered to
      French dyslexic children and two chronological age (CA) and reading age
      (RA)-matched control groups. Children had to judge whether two successively and
      briefly presented four-letter strings were identical or different.
      Letter-position and letter identity were manipulated through the transposition
      (e.g., RTGM vs. RMGT) or substitution of two letters (e.g., TSHF vs. TGHD).
      Non-words, pseudo-words, and words were used as stimuli to investigate
      sub-lexical and lexical effects on letter encoding. Dyslexic children showed both
      substitution and transposition detection problems relative to CA-controls. A
      substitution advantage over transpositions was only found for words in dyslexic
      children whereas it extended to pseudo-words in RA-controls and to all type of
      items in CA-controls. Letters were better identified in the dyslexic group when
      belonging to orthographically familiar strings. Letter-position encoding was very
      impaired in dyslexic children who did not show any word context effect in
      contrast to CA-controls. Overall, the current findings point to a strong letter
      identity and letter-position encoding disorder in developmental dyslexia.

      task over a first session (online learning) and a second session 24 hours later
      (offline learning). While both groups showed improvements in performance during
      offline learning, only the control group showed improvements in performance
      during online learning. Moreover, the DD group differed from the control group in
      their ability to recover from the introduction of a different sequence.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the neural substrates of an adult
      English-German bilingual with dyslexia (in both languages) during lexical
      decision-making using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A lexical
      decision task with five conditions in a block design was employed (nonverbal
      shape judgment, lettercase judgment, regular word judgment, irregular word
      judgment, and nonword judgment), and the activation was compared to a
      non-dyslexic control bilingual and a control monolingual participant. Both of the
      control participants matched the dyslexic bilingual BK on age, sex, IQ,
      handedness, and education level. Results indicated that the bilingual adult with 
      dyslexia was strongly right lateralized for stimuli that required phonological
      processing, a profile that differed particularly from the activation observed
      from the monolingual participant. These results are consistent with the idea of
      increased activation (mostly in the right hemisphere) during linguistic tasks in 
      adults with dyslexia and in late proficient bilinguals relative to monolinguals. 
      Findings also suggest that the additional activation observed in both of the
      bilinguals are similar, suggesting that these effects are not additive in the
      dyslexic bilingual.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia, we have investigated
      neurocognitive processes related to phonology and other risk factors of later
      reading problems. Here we review studies in which we have investigated whether
      dyslexic children with familial risk background would show atypical
      auditory/speech processing at birth, at six months and later before school and at
      school age as measured by brain event-related potentials (ERPs), and how infant
      ERPs are related to later pre-reading cognitive skills and literacy outcome.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: One half of the children came from families with at least
      one dyslexic parent (the at-risk group), while the other half belonged to the
      control group without any familial background of dyslexia. RESULTS: Early ERPs
      were correlated to kindergarten age phonological processing and letter-naming
      skills as well as phoneme duration perception, reading and writing skills at
      school age. The correlations were, in general, more consistent among at-risk
      children. Those at-risk children who became poor readers also differed from
      typical readers in the infant ERP measures at the group level. ERPs measured
      before school and at the 3rd grade also differed between dyslexic and typical
      readers. Further, speech perception at behavioural level differed between
      dyslexic and typical readers, but not in all dyslexic readers. CONCLUSIONS: These
      findings suggest persisting developmental differences in the organization of the 
      neural networks sub-serving auditory and speech perception, with cascading
      effects on later reading related skills, in children with familial background for
      dyslexia. However, atypical auditory/speech processing is not likely a sufficient
      reason by itself for dyslexia but rather one endophenotype or risk factor.

AB  - AIM: Ten years ago, we published developmental data on a representative group of 
      children (n = 25) with moderate or severe speech and language impairment, who
      were attending special preschools for children. The aim of this study was to
      perform a follow-up of these children as teenagers. METHODS: Parents of 23
      teenagers participated in a clinical interview that requested information on the 
      child's current academic achievement, type of school, previous clinical
      assessments, and developmental diagnoses. Fifteen children participated in a
      speech and language evaluation, and 13 participated in a psychological
      evaluation. RESULTS: Seven of the 23 teenagers had a mild intellectual
      disability, and another three had borderline intellectual functioning. Nine had
      symptoms of disorders on the autism spectrum; five of these had an autism
      spectrum disorder, and four had clear autistic traits. Six met criteria for
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/subthreshold ADHD. Thirteen of 15
      teenagers had a moderate or severe language impairment, and 13 of 15 had a
      moderate or severe reading impairment. Overlapping disorders were frequent. None 
      of the individuals who underwent the clinical evaluation were free from
      developmental problems. CONCLUSION: A large number of children with speech and
      language impairment at preschool age had persistent language problems and/or met 
      the criteria for developmental diagnoses other than speech and language
      impairment at their follow-up as teenagers. Language impairment in young children
      is a marker for several developmental disorders, particularly intellectual
      disability and autism spectrum disorder.

TI  - Differences in learning volitional (manual) and non-volitional (posture) aspects 
      of a complex motor skill in young adult dyslexic and skilled readers.
PG  - e43488
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0043488 [doi]
AB  - The 'Cerebellar Deficit Theory' of developmental dyslexia proposes that a subtle 
      developmental cerebellar dysfunction leads to deficits in attaining 'automatic'
      procedures and therefore manifests as subtle motor impairments (e.g., balance
      control, motor skill learning) in addition to the reading and phonological
      difficulties. A more recent version of the theory suggests a core deficit in
      motor skill acquisition. This study was undertaken to compare the time-course and
      the nature of practice-related changes in volitional (manual) and non-volitional 
      (posture) motor performance in dyslexic and typical readers while learning a new 
      movement sequence. Seventeen dyslexic and 26 skilled young adult readers
      underwent a three-session training program in which they practiced a novel
      sequence of manual movements while standing in a quiet stance position. Both
      groups exhibited robust and well-retained gains in speed, with no loss of
      accuracy, on the volitional, manual, aspects of the task, with a time-course
      characteristic of procedural learning. However, the dyslexic readers exhibited a 
      pervasive slowness in the initiation of volitional performance. In addition,
      while typical readers showed clear and well-retained task-related adaptation of
      the balance and posture control system, the dyslexic readers had significantly
      larger sway and variance of sway throughout the three sessions and were less
      efficient in adapting the posture control system to support the acquisition of
      the novel movement sequence. These results support the notion of a
      non-language-related deficit in developmental dyslexia, one related to the
      recruitment of motor systems for effective task performance rather than to a
      general motor learning disability.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0043122 [doi]
AB  - The neural correlates of developmental dyslexia have been investigated
      intensively over the last two decades and reliable evidence for a dysfunction of 
      left-hemispheric reading systems in dyslexic readers has been found in functional
      neuroimaging studies. In addition, structural imaging studies using voxel-based
      morphometry (VBM) demonstrated grey matter reductions in dyslexics in several
      brain regions. To objectively assess the consistency of these findings, we
      performed activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on nine published 
      VBM studies reporting 62 foci of grey matter reduction in dyslexic readers. We
      found six significant clusters of convergence in bilateral temporo-parietal and
      left occipito-temporal cortical regions and in the cerebellum bilaterally. To
      identify possible overlaps between structural and functional deviations in
      dyslexic readers, we conducted additional ALE meta-analyses of imaging studies
      reporting functional underactivations (125 foci from 24 studies) or
      overactivations (95 foci from 11 studies ) in dyslexics. Subsequent conjunction
      analyses revealed overlaps between the results of the VBM meta-analysis and the
      meta-analysis of functional underactivations in the fusiform and supramarginal
      gyri of the left hemisphere. An overlap between VBM results and the meta-analysis
      of functional overactivations was found in the left cerebellum. The results of
      our study provide evidence for consistent grey matter variations bilaterally in
      the dyslexic brain and substantial overlap of these structural variations with
      functional abnormalities in left hemispheric regions.

AB  - Motor timing tasks have been employed in studies of neurodevelopmental disorders 
      such as developmental dyslexia and ADHD, where they provide an index of temporal 
      processing ability. Investigations of these disorders have used different
      stimulus parameters within the motor timing tasks that are likely to affect
      performance measures. Here we assessed the effect of auditory and visual pacing
      stimuli on synchronised motor timing performance and its relationship with
      cognitive and behavioural predictors that are commonly used in the diagnosis of
      these highly prevalent developmental disorders. Twenty-one children (mean age 9.6
      years) completed a finger tapping task in two stimulus conditions, together with 
      additional psychometric measures. As anticipated, synchronisation to the beat
      (ISI 329 ms) was less accurate in the visually paced condition. Decomposition of 
      timing variance indicated that this effect resulted from differences in the way
      that visual and auditory paced tasks are processed by central timekeeping and
      associated peripheral implementation systems. The ability to utilise an efficient
      processing strategy on the visual task correlated with both reading and sustained
      attention skills. Dissociations between these patterns of relationship across
      task modality suggest that not all timing tasks are equivalent.

AB  - Cilia are cell organelles that play important roles in cell motility, sensory and
      developmental functions and are involved in a range of human diseases, known as
      ciliopathies. Here, we search for novel human genes related to cilia using a
      strategy that exploits the previously reported tendency of cell type-specific
      genes to be coexpressed in the transcriptome of complex tissues. Gene
      coexpression networks were constructed using the noise-resistant WGCNA algorithm 
      in 12 publicly available microarray datasets from human tissues rich in motile
      cilia: airways, fallopian tubes and brain. A cilia-related coexpression module
      was detected in 10 out of the 12 datasets. A consensus analysis of this module's 
      gene composition recapitulated 297 known and predicted 74 novel cilia-related
      genes. 82% of the novel candidates were supported by tissue-specificity
      expression data from GEO and/or proteomic data from the Human Protein Atlas. The 
      novel findings included a set of genes (DCDC2, DYX1C1, KIAA0319) related to a
      neurological disease dyslexia suggesting their potential involvement in ciliary
      functions. Furthermore, we searched for differences in gene composition of the
      ciliary module between the tissues. A multidrug-and-toxin extrusion transporter
      MATE2 (SLC47A2) was found as a brain-specific central gene in the ciliary module.
      We confirm the localization of MATE2 in cilia by immunofluorescence staining
      using MDCK cells as a model. While MATE2 has previously gained attention as a
      pharmacologically relevant transporter, its potential relation to cilia is
      suggested for the first time. Taken together, our large-scale analysis of gene
      coexpression networks identifies novel genes related to human cell cilia.

      randomized into two equal groups: group 1 received encephabol (suspension form,
      daily dosage 200-250 mg, or 12-15 mg/kg) during 2 months; group 2 did not receive
      this medication. In the first group, there was a significant improvement of
      expressive and impressive speech and speech attention; the active vocabulary and 
      a number of phrases in colloquial speech increased by a factor of 3 versus 1.5 in
      the control group. After the treatment with encephabol, the parents reported the 
      decrease in motor disturbances, psychosomatic disorders, the improvement of
      attention and the emotional state of the children.

AB  - The development of reading skills may depend to a certain extent on the
      development of basic visual perception. The magnocellular theory of developmental
      dyslexia assumes that deficits in the magnocellular pathway, indicated by less
      sensitivity in perceiving dynamic sensory stimuli, are responsible for a
      proportion of reading difficulties experienced by dyslexics. Using a task that
      measures coherent motion detection threshold, this study examined the
      relationship between dynamic visual perception and reading development in Chinese
      children. Experiment 1 compared the performance of 27 dyslexics and their age-
      and IQ-matched controls in the coherent motion detection task and in a static
      pattern perception task. Results showed that only in the former task did the
      dyslexics have a significantly higher threshold than the controls, suggesting
      that Chinese dyslexics, like some of their Western counterparts, may have
      deficits in magnocellular pathway. Experiment 2 examined whether dynamic visual
      processing affects specific cognitive processes in reading. One hundred
      fifth-grade children were tested on visual perception and reading-related tasks. 
      Regression analyses found that the motion detection threshold accounted for 11%
      and 12%, respectively, variance in the speed of orthographic similarity judgment 
      and in the accuracy of picture naming after IQ and vocabulary size were
      controlled. The static pattern detection threshold could not account for any
      variance. It is concluded that reading development in Chinese depends to a
      certain extent on the development of dynamic visual perception and its underlying
      neural pathway and that the impact of visual development can be specifically
      related to orthographic processing in reading Chinese.

TI  - Auditory short-term memory capacity correlates with gray matter density in the
      left posterior STS in cognitively normal and dyslexic adults.
PG  - 3746-56
LID - 10.1162/jocn_a_00060 [doi]
AB  - A central feature of auditory STM is its item-limited processing capacity. We
      investigated whether auditory STM capacity correlated with regional gray and
      white matter in the structural MRI images from 74 healthy adults, 40 of whom had 
      a prior diagnosis of developmental dyslexia whereas 34 had no history of any
      cognitive impairment. Using whole-brain statistics, we identified a region in the
      left posterior STS where gray matter density was positively correlated with
      forward digit span, backward digit span, and performance on a "spoonerisms" task 
      that required both auditory STM and phoneme manipulation. Across tasks and
      participant groups, the correlation was highly significant even when variance
      related to reading and auditory nonword repetition was factored out. Although the
      dyslexics had poorer phonological skills, the effect of auditory STM capacity in 
      the left STS was the same as in the cognitively normal group. We also illustrate 
      that the anatomical location of this effect is in proximity to a lesion site
      recently associated with reduced auditory STM capacity in patients with stroke
      damage. This result, therefore, indicates that gray matter density in the
      posterior STS predicts auditory STM capacity in the healthy and damaged brain. In
      conclusion, we suggest that our present findings are consistent with the view
      that there is an overlap between the mechanisms that support language processing 
      and auditory STM.

AB  - Language and learning disorders such as reading disability and language
      impairment are recognized to be subject to substantial genetic influences, but
      few causal mutations have been identified in the coding regions of candidate
      genes. Association analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms have suggested the
      involvement of regulatory regions of these genes, and a few mutations affecting
      gene expression levels have been identified, indicating that the quantity rather 
      than the quality of the gene product may be most relevant for these disorders. In
      addition, several of the candidate genes appear to be involved in neuronal
      migration, confirming the importance of early developmental processes.
      Accordingly, alterations in epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and
      histone modification are likely to be important in the causes of language and
      learning disorders based on their functions in gene regulation. Epigenetic
      processes direct the differentiation of cells in early development when
      neurological pathways are set down, and mutations in genes involved in epigenetic
      regulation are known to cause cognitive disorders in humans. Epigenetic processes
      also regulate the changes in gene expression in response to learning, and
      alterations in histone modification are associated with learning and memory
      deficits in animals. Genetic defects in histone modification have been reversed
      in animals through therapeutic interventions resulting in rescue of these
      deficits, making it particularly important to investigate their potential
      contribution to learning disorders in humans.

AB  - Cerebral infarctions are uncommon in neonates. However, they should be considered
      among causes of neonatal seizures. We describe seven neonates with cerebral
      infarctions. Clinical presentations, perinatal history, perinatal risk factors,
      cranial magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography findings,
      thrombophilic factors, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Six patients
      manifested seizures, whereas one exhibited cyanosis. Six neonates manifested left
      middle cerebral artery infarctions, and one exhibited a borderzone infarction
      between the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries. Electroencephalograms
      indicated epileptiform discharges on the left hemisphere in three neonates with
      left middle cerebral artery territory infarctions, and epileptiform discharges on
      both hemispheres in one patient. At most recent follow-up visit, five patients
      had achieved normal development, whereas one exhibited right hemiparesis and
      aphasia, and another manifested toe-in gait. These findings may help predict
      neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with cerebral infarctions.

PG  - 1179-96
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2011.05.013 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to examine past-tense spelling deficits in
      developmental dyslexia and their relationship to phonological abilities, spoken
      morphological awareness and word specific orthographic memory. Three groups of
      children (28 9-year-old dyslexic, 28 chronological age-matched and 28
      reading/spelling age-matched children) completed a battery of tests including
      spelling regularly inflected words (e.g., kissed) and matched one-morpheme words 
      (e.g., wrist). They were also assessed on a range of tests of reading and
      spelling abilities and associated linguistic measures. Dyslexic children were
      impaired in relation to chronological age-matched controls on all measures.
      Furthermore, they were significantly poorer than younger reading and spelling
      age-matched controls at spelling inflected verbs, supporting the existence of a
      specific deficit in past-tense spelling in dyslexia. In addition to under-using
      the -ed spelling on inflected verbs, the dyslexic children were less likely to
      erroneously apply this spelling to one-morpheme words than younger controls.
      Dyslexics were also poorer than younger controls at using a consistent spelling
      for stems presented in isolation versus as part of an inflected word, indicating 
      that they make less use of the morphological relations between words to support
      their spelling. In line with this interpretation, regression analyses revealed
      another qualitative difference between the spelling and reading age-matched group
      and the dyslexic group: while both spoken morphological awareness and
      orthographic word specific memory were significant predictors of the accuracy of 
      past-tense spelling in the former group, only orthographic memory (irregular word
      reading and spelling) was a significant factor in the dyslexic group. Finally, we
      identified a subgroup of seven dyslexic children who were severely deficient in
      past-tense spelling. This subgroup was also significantly worse than other
      dyslexics and than younger controls on scores of orthographic memory. The
      implications of our findings for teaching and remediation strategies are
      discussed.

AB  - The nature of word recognition difficulties in developmental dyslexia is still a 
      topic of controversy. We investigated the contribution of phonological processing
      deficits and uncertainty to the word recognition difficulties of dyslexic
      children by mathematical diffusion modeling of visual and auditory lexical
      decision data. The first study showed that poor visual lexical decision
      performance of reading disabled children was mainly due to a delay in the
      evaluation of word characteristics, suggesting impaired phonological processing. 
      The adoption of elevated certainty criteria by the disabled readers suggests that
      uncertainty contributed to the visual word recognition impairments as well. The
      second study replicated the outcomes for visual lexical decision with formally
      diagnosed dyslexic children. In addition, during auditory lexical decision,
      dyslexics presented with reduced accuracy, which also resulted from delayed
      evaluation of word characteristics. Since orthographic influences are diminished 
      during auditory lexical decision, this strengthens the phonological processing
      deficit account. Dyslexic children did not adopt heightened certainty criteria
      during auditory lexical decision, indicating that uncertainty solely impairs
      reading and not listening.

AB  - Developmental reading disorder (RD) affects 5-10% of school aged children, with a
      heritability of approximately 60%. Genetic association studies have identified
      several candidate RD susceptibility genes, including DCDC2; however, a direct
      connection between the function of these genes and cognitive or learning
      impairments remains unclear. Variants in DCDC2, a member of the doublecortin
      family of genes, have been associated in humans with RD and ADHD and Dcdc2 may
      play a role in neuronal migration in rats. In this study, we examined the effect 
      of Dcdc2 mutation on cognitive abilities in mice using a visual attention and
      visuo-spatial learning and memory task. We show that both heterozygous and
      homozygous mutations of Dcdc2 result in persistent visuo-spatial memory deficits,
      as well as visual discrimination and long-term memory deficits. These behavioral 
      deficits occur in the absence of neuronal migration disruption in the mutant
      mice, and may be comorbid with an anxiety phenotype. These are the first results 
      to suggest a direct relationship between induced mutation in Dcdc2 and changes in
      behavioral measures. Dcdc2 mutant mice should prove useful in future studies
      designed to further dissect the underlying neural mechanisms that are impaired
      following Dcdc2 mutation.

TI  - [Developmental changes of rapid automatized naming and Hiragana reading of
      Japanese in elementary-school children].
PG  - 465-70
AB  - Two hundred and seven Japanese elementary school children aged from 6 (Grade 1)
      to 12 (Grade 6) years old were tested for their abilities to name numbers and
      pictured objects along with reading Hiragana characters and words. These children
      all showed typical development and their classroom teachers judged that they were
      not having any problems with reading or writing. The children were randomly
      divided into two groups, the first group was assigned to two naming tasks;the
      rapid automatized naming (RAN) of "numbers" and "pictured objects," the second
      group was assigned to two rapid alternative stimulus (RAS) naming tasks using
      numbers and pictured objects. All children were asked to perform two reading
      tasks that were written in Hiragana script: single mora reading task and four
      syllable word reading task. The total articulation time for naming and reading
      and performance in terms of accuracy were measured for each task. Developmental
      changes in these variables were evaluated. The articulation time was
      significantly longer for the first graders, and it gradually shortened as they
      moved through to the upper grades in all tasks. The articulation time reached a
      plateau in the 5th grade for the number naming, while gradual change continued
      after drastic change in the lower grades for the pictured object naming. The
      articulation times for the single mora reading and RAN of numbers correlated
      strongly. The articulation time for the RAS naming was significantly longer
      compared to that for the RAN, though there were very few errors. The RAS naming
      showed the highest correlation with the four syllable word reading. This study
      demonstrated that the performance in rapid automatized naming of numbers and
      pictures were closely related with performance on reading tasks. Thus Japanese
      children with reading disorders such as developmental dyslexia should also be
      evaluated for rapid automatized naming.

TI  - Relative burden of large CNVs on a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes.
PG  - e1002334
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002334 [doi]
AB  - While numerous studies have implicated copy number variants (CNVs) in a range of 
      neurological phenotypes, the impact relative to disease severity has been
      difficult to ascertain due to small sample sizes, lack of phenotypic details, and
      heterogeneity in platforms used for discovery. Using a customized microarray
      enriched for genomic hotspots, we assayed for large CNVs among 1,227 individuals 
      with various neurological deficits including dyslexia (376), sporadic autism
      (350), and intellectual disability (ID) (501), as well as 337 controls. We show
      that the frequency of large CNVs (>1 Mbp) is significantly greater for
      ID-associated phenotypes compared to autism (p = 9.58 x 10(-11), odds ratio =
      4.59), dyslexia (p = 3.81 x 10(-18), odds ratio = 14.45), or controls (p = 2.75 x
      10(-17), odds ratio = 13.71). There is a striking difference in the frequency of 
      rare CNVs (>50 kbp) in autism (10%, p = 2.4 x 10(-6), odds ratio = 6) or ID (16%,
      p = 3.55 x 10(-12), odds ratio = 10) compared to dyslexia (2%) with essentially
      no difference in large CNV burden among dyslexia patients compared to controls.
      Rare CNVs were more likely to arise de novo (64%) in ID when compared to autism
      (40%) or dyslexia (0%). We observed a significantly increased large CNV burden in
      individuals with ID and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) compared to ID alone 
      (p = 0.001, odds ratio = 2.54). Our data suggest that large CNV burden positively
      correlates with the severity of childhood disability: ID with MCA being most
      severely affected and dyslexics being indistinguishable from controls. When
      autism without ID was considered separately, the increase in CNV burden was
      modest compared to controls (p = 0.07, odds ratio = 2.33).

TI  - The brain basis of the phonological deficit in dyslexia is independent of IQ.
PG  - 1442-51
LID - 10.1177/0956797611419521 [doi]
AB  - Although the role of IQ in developmental dyslexia remains ambiguous, the dominant
      clinical and research approaches rely on a definition of dyslexia that requires
      reading skill to be significantly below the level expected given an individual's 
      IQ. In the study reported here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to examine whether 
      differences in brain activation during phonological processing that are
      characteristic of dyslexia were similar or dissimilar in children with poor
      reading ability who had high IQ scores (discrepant readers) and in children with 
      poor reading ability who had low IQ scores (nondiscrepant readers). In two
      independent samples including a total of 131 children, using univariate and
      multivariate pattern analyses, we found that discrepant and nondiscrepant poor
      readers exhibited similar patterns of reduced activation in brain areas such as
      left parietotemporal and occipitotemporal regions. These results converge with
      behavioral evidence indicating that, regardless of IQ, poor readers have similar 
      kinds of reading difficulties in relation to phonological processing.

TI  - Motor ability and weight status are determinants of out-of-school activity
      participation for children with developmental coordination disorder.
PG  - 2614-23
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.06.013 [doi]
AB  - According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
      Health model endorsed by the World Health Organization, participation in everyday
      activities is integral to normal child development. However, little is known
      about the influence of motor ability and weight status on physical activity
      participation in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). This
      study aimed to (1) compare motor performance, weight status and pattern of
      out-of-school activity participation between children with DCD and those without;
      and (2) identify whether motor ability and weight status were determinants of
      participation patterns among children with DCD. We enrolled 81 children with DCD 
      (boys, n = 63; girls, n = 18; mean age, 8.07 +/- 1.5 years) and 67 typically
      developing children (boys, n = 48; girls, n = 19; mean age, 8.25 +/- 1.6 years). 
      Participation patterns (diversity, intensity, companionship, location, and
      enjoyment) were evaluated with the Children Assessment of Participation and
      Enjoyment. Motor ability was evaluated with the Movement Assessment Battery for
      Children, second edition (MABC-2). Other factors that may influence participation
      such as age, gender, and body weight were also recorded. Analysis of variance was
      used to compare outcome variables of the two groups, and significant determinants
      of activity participation were identified by multiple regression analysis.
      Children with DCD participated in fewer activities (i.e., limited participation
      diversity) and participated less frequently (i.e., limited participation
      intensity) than their typically developing peers; however, companionship,
      location of participation, and enjoyment level did not differ between the two
      groups. Children in the DCD group demonstrated significantly worse motor ability 
      as assessed by the MABC-2. Further, a greater proportion of children in the DCD
      group were in the overweight/obese category compared with their typically
      developing peers. After accounting for the effects of age and gender, motor
      ability and weight category explained 7.6% and 5.0% of the variance in
      participation diversity, respectively, for children with DCD. Children with DCD
      showed less diverse and less intense out-of-school activity participation than
      typically developing children. Motor impairment and weight status were
      independently associated with the lower participation diversity. Interventions
      aiming at improving participation for children with DCD should target weight
      control and training in motor proficiency. Further study is needed to identify
      other factors that may hinder participation in this group of children.

      dyslexia.
PG  - 2810-9
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.05.025 [doi]
AB  - The etiology of developmental dyslexia remains widely debated. An appealing
      theory postulates that the reading and spelling problems in individuals with
      dyslexia originate from reduced sensitivity to slow-rate dynamic auditory cues.
      This low-level auditory deficit is thought to provoke a cascade of effects,
      including inaccurate speech perception and eventually unspecified phoneme
      representations. The present study investigated sensitivity to frequency
      modulation and amplitude rise time, speech-in-noise perception and phonological
      awareness in 11-year-old children with dyslexia and a matched normal-reading
      control children. Group comparisons demonstrated that children with dyslexia were
      less sensitive than normal-reading children to slow-rate dynamic auditory
      processing, speech-in-noise perception, phonological awareness and literacy
      abilities. Correlations were found between slow-rate dynamic auditory processing 
      and phonological awareness, and speech-in-noise perception and reading. Yet, no
      significant correlation between slow-rate dynamic auditory processing and
      speech-in-noise perception was obtained. Together, these results indicate that
      children with dyslexia have difficulties with slow-rate dynamic auditory
      processing and speech-in-noise perception and that these problems persist until
      sixth grade.

TI  - An interpretative model of early indicators of specific developmental dyslexia in
      preschool age: a comparative presentation of three studies in Greece.
PG  - 3003-16
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.03.021 [doi]
AB  - The detection of specific factors of the developmental dyslexia at an early
      stage, and the identification of the role of those factors responsible for its
      manifestation, is a fundamental area of study on dyslexia in the recent
      literature. The objective of the present study is to clarify that dysfunctions in
      the following specific domains contribute in a causal model to the occurrence of 
      dyslexia at an early stage: phonological awareness, psychomotor ability (body
      shape, spatio-temporal orientation, grapho-motor ability and laterality),
      perception, memory, attention, prereading and prewriting skills. The results of
      three studies, --carried out in Greece--which revealed the above factors as main 
      predictors of the early onset of Specific Developmental Dyslexia (SDD) and
      confirmed the importance of intervention methods to it, led us to the
      construction of the proposed, causal model. The findings of these three studies
      converge on the perspective that the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of
      dysfunctions in the above domains, from preschool age, enable the early and
      reliable prevention of future difficulties in the learning process of children.

TI  - Abnormal functional lateralization and activity of language brain areas in
      typical specific language impairment (developmental dysphasia).

AB  - Atypical functional lateralization and specialization for language have been
      proposed to account for developmental language disorders, yet results from
      functional neuroimaging studies are sparse and inconsistent. This functional
      magnetic resonance imaging study compared children with a specific subtype of
      specific language impairment affecting structural language (n = 21), to a matched
      group of typically developing children using a panel of four language tasks
      neither requiring reading nor metalinguistic skills, including two auditory
      lexico-semantic tasks (category fluency and responsive naming) and two visual
      phonological tasks based on picture naming. Data processing involved normalizing 
      the data with respect to a matched pairs paediatric template, groups and
      between-groups analysis, and laterality indices assessment within regions of
      interest using single and combined task analysis. Children with specific language
      impairment exhibited a significant lack of left lateralization in all core
      language regions (inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal
      gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus), across
      single or combined task analysis, but no difference of lateralization for the
      rest of the brain. Between-group comparisons revealed a left hypoactivation of
      Wernicke's area at the posterior superior temporal/supramarginal junction during 
      the responsive naming task, and a right hyperactivation encompassing the anterior
      insula with adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the head of the caudate nucleus
      during the first phonological task. This study thus provides evidence that this
      subtype of specific language impairment is associated with atypical
      lateralization and functioning of core language areas.

TI  - Increased intraindividual variability is a marker of ADHD but also of dyslexia: a
      study on handwriting.
PG  - 33-9
LID - 10.1016/j.bandc.2011.06.005 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that intraindividual variability (IIV) in
      neuropsychological tasks may be a specific characteristic of Attention-Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but previous research has not thoroughly examined 
      whether IIV also concerns academic performance or other types of developmental
      disabilities. The present study investigates the role of IIV in 15 children with 
      ADHD without reading difficulties, 15 children with dyslexia without associated
      symptoms of ADHD, and 15 typically developing children (TDC) in a simple response
      time (SRT) task and in a skill more directly related with school
      learning-handwriting. Results show that children with ADHD and those with
      dyslexia have a greater IIV than the TDC in both tasks. However, the pattern of
      the relationship between IIV in SRT and handwriting was different in children
      with ADHD and dyslexia: the IIV in the handwriting task was found to depend on
      IIV in the SRT task only in children with dyslexia. These findings support the
      crucial role of IIV not only in ADHD but also in other developmental
      disabilities, but suggest that in children with ADHD it may present specific
      aspects related with motor control.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution
      of results of a developmental screening for school entry and procedures initiated
      by school doctors. METHOD: Based on achievement in SOPESS of 372 children (188
      female, 184 male) and the resulting recommendations of the school doctors, the
      distribution of frequencies in cross-classified tables was analysed, and Cramer's
      V was calculated. RESULTS: No sex differences were found in early numeracy and
      coordination skills. Girls performed more frequently without any problems in the 
      other domains assessed by SOPESS. Recommendations of school doctors referring to 
      clarification of the finding or treatment are lower than the frequencies of
      critical results in SOPESS. This effect is especially critical in the domains of 
      numeracy and attention. Critical SOPESS achievements in numeracy are found in 12%
      (attention: 10,2%) of the children, but only 0,5% (attention: 2,4%) are given
      recommendations for further treatment. An increase of documentation for parent
      counselling can be observed. CONCLUSION: Documentation of the findings shows that
      medical recommendations for most domains of SOPESS are in accordance with
      frequencies of critical screening results. Further information is necessary for
      the domains of attention and numeracy.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The responsibilities of public health authorities include early
      detection of risks for healthy development at school. Reading /writing disorder
      and math disorder are among the most common developmental disorders in childhood.
      METHOD: The present study conveys information about the prevalence of specific
      developmental disorders of scholastic skills (N=372) and assesses the prognostic 
      validity of the social-paediatric screening of developmental status for school
      entry (SOPESS), the relevant criteria being DERET 1-2+, DEMAT 1+, and ELFE 1-6.
      RESULTS: The prevalence of specific developmental disorders of scholastic skills 
      ranges from 1.1% for dyscalculia to 3.0% for dyslexia. Adequate correlations of
      r= -0.42(DERET 1-2+; DEMAT 1+) and r= -0.43 (ELFE 1-6) as well as substantial
      negative predictive values (0.80-0.93) suggest an acceptable screening
      performance. CONCLUSION: Children without clinical findings in SOPESS do not
      display any learning disabilities at onset of the 2nd grade while children marked
      at risk by SOPESS seem to benefit from concurrent intervention (e.g., language
      promotion programmes): such disabilities emerge in only half of these children.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to determine the role of precursors
      in the prediction of school achievement. 372 children were followed from health
      examination for school entry to the second grade. METHODS: Preschool skills
      assessed by a screening of developmental stage (SOPESS) were related to
      second-grade reading (ELFE 1-6), spelling (DERET 1-2+), and arithmetic (DEMAT 1+)
      by correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: Correlations between numeracy
      and math abilities (r=0,340) met with our expectations as also did those between 
      verbal abilities and spelling (r=0,276). The subtests of attention and counting
      (SOPESS) contribute significantly to an explanation of the variance in school
      achievement. Numeracy predicts math achievement, and verbal memory contributes to
      school achievement in math and spelling. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the
      contribution of visual selective attention, phonological memory, and verbal
      abilities to the development of reading, spelling, and math at primary school.

TI  - Slow perceptual processing at the core of developmental dyslexia: a
      parameter-based assessment of visual attention.
PG  - 3454-65
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.08.021 [doi]
AB  - The cognitive causes as well as the neurological and genetic basis of
      developmental dyslexia, a complex disorder of written language acquisition, are
      intensely discussed with regard to multiple-deficit models. Accumulating evidence
      has revealed dyslexics' impairments in a variety of tasks requiring visual
      attention. The heterogeneity of these experimental results, however, points to
      the need for measures that are sufficiently sensitive to differentiate between
      impaired and preserved attentional components within a unified framework. This
      first parameter-based group study of attentional components in developmental
      dyslexia addresses potentially altered attentional components that have recently 
      been associated with parietal dysfunctions in dyslexia. We aimed to isolate the
      general attentional resources that might underlie reduced span performance, i.e.,
      either a deficient working memory storage capacity, or a slowing in visual
      perceptual processing speed, or both. Furthermore, by analysing attentional
      selectivity in dyslexia, we addressed a potential lateralized abnormality of
      visual attention, i.e., a previously suggested rightward spatial deviation
      compared to normal readers. We investigated a group of high-achieving young
      adults with persisting dyslexia and matched normal readers in an experimental
      whole report and a partial report of briefly presented letter arrays. Possible
      deviations in the parametric values of the dyslexic compared to the control group
      were taken as markers for the underlying deficit. The dyslexic group showed a
      striking reduction in perceptual processing speed (by 26% compared to controls)
      while their working memory storage capacity was in the normal range. In addition,
      a spatial deviation of attentional weighting compared to the control group was
      confirmed in dyslexic readers, which was larger in participants with a more
      severe dyslexic disorder. In general, the present study supports the relevance of
      perceptual processing speed in disorders of written language acquisition and
      demonstrates that the parametric assessment provides a suitable tool for
      specifying the underlying deficit within a unitary framework.

TI  - [White matter in developmental disorders].
PG  - 361-71
AB  - The white matter is the main connection between different regions of the brain
      and helps them to work in a unified, coordinated way. Diffusion tensor imaging is
      an ideal technique with which to study it in order to detect the degree of
      integrity of these fibres. Nowadays, they are considered to play a significant
      role in the development and pathophysiology of different developmental disorders,
      and the aim of this study was to examine this role. On reviewing disorders such
      as autism, dyslexia or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, certain fibres
      were found to be clearly involved. This was especially the case of the (arcuate) 
      superior longitudinal fasciculus and the temporal-parietal network (related with 
      the regulation of motor and attentional behaviour), the corpus callosum (which
      ensures the efficient and swift exchange of information between the hemispheres

AB  - The dyslexia-associated gene DCDC2 is a member of the DCX family of genes known
      to play roles in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and differentiation. Here we
      report the first phenotypic analysis of a Dcdc2 knockout mouse. Comparisons
      between Dcdc2 knockout mice and wild-type (wt) littermates revealed no
      significant differences in neuronal migration, neocortical lamination, neuronal
      cilliogenesis or dendritic differentiation. Considering previous studies showing 
      genetic interactions and potential functional redundancy among members of the DCX
      family, we tested whether decreasing Dcx expression by RNAi would differentially 
      impair neurodevelopment in Dcdc2 knockouts and wild-type mice. Consistent with
      this hypothesis, we found that deficits in neuronal migration, and dendritic
      growth caused by RNAi of Dcx were more severe in Dcdc2 knockouts than in
      wild-type mice with the same transfection. These results indicate that Dcdc2 is
      not required for neurogenesis, neuronal migration or differentiation in mice, but
      may have partial functional redundancy with Dcx.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining stimuli arriving at both ears makes it possible to locate
      sounds in the environment and to better detect signals or understand speech in
      noise when the sound sources are separated spatially. The sensitivity of the
      binaural system to interaural differences in time and amplitude can be
      investigated by means of the binaural masking level difference (BMLD). The age at
      which the BMLD reaches adult levels appears to depend partly upon masker
      bandwidth. Less is known about the effect of masker's level on the development of
      BMLD in children. In the present study we assessed the effect of masker level on 
      the BMLD of 3rd and 5th grade skilled reading children. In view of possible
      binaural hearing effects in dyslexia, the BMLD of a group of 5th grade children
      with reading difficulties was measured. METHODS: Detection thresholds of 500 Hz
      pure tone were measured at noise levels of 40 dBHL, 50 dBHL and 60 dBHL. RESULTS:
      All subjects presented increased MLD values with the rise of noise intensity
      between 40 dBHL and 60 dBHL. Among the skilled readers the results showed that
      younger children had smaller BMLDs than older children at all masker levels.
      However, a significant group-by-intensity interaction indicated that although the
      reading disabled group had reduced BMLD values than older skilled readers at
      noise levels of 50 dBHL and 60 dBHL, no difference was found between their BMLD
      values and those of the young skilled readers at noise levels of 50 dBHL and 60
      dBHL. Moreover, their BMLD values at noise level of 40 dBHL were higher than
      those of the 3rd grade typically reading students while no difference was found
      between them and 5th grade efficient readers. CONCLUSIONS: These results support 
      the existence of both quantitative and qualitative differences in binaural
      hearing of children with developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Superior parietal lobule dysfunction in a homogeneous group of dyslexic children 
      with a visual attention span disorder.
PG  - 128-38
LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2010.06.005 [doi]
AB  - A visual attention (VA) span disorder has been reported in dyslexic children as
      potentially responsible for their poor reading outcome. The purpose of the
      current paper was to identify the cerebral correlates of this VA span disorder.
      For this purpose, 12 French dyslexic children with severe reading and VA span
      disorders and 12 age-matched control children were engaged in a categorisation
      task under fMRI. Two flanked and isolated conditions were designed which both
      involved multiple-element simultaneous visual processing but taxed visual
      attention differently. For skilled readers, flanked stimuli processing activated 
      a large bilateral cortical network comprising the superior and inferior parietal 
      cortex, the inferior temporal cortex, the striate and extrastriate visual cortex,
      the middle frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex while the less
      attention-demanding task of isolated stimuli only activated the inferior
      occipito-temporal cortex bilaterally. With respect to controls, the dyslexic
      children showed significantly reduced activation within bilateral parietal and
      temporal areas during flanked processing, but no difference during the isolated
      condition. The neural correlates of the processes involved in attention-demanding
      multi-element processing tasks were more specifically addressed by contrasting
      the flanked and the isolated conditions. This contrast elicited activation of the
      left precuneus/superior parietal lobule in the controls, but not in the dyslexic 
      children. These findings provide new insights on the role of parietal regions, in
      particular the left superior parietal lobule, in the visual attention span and in
      developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 793-808
LID - 10.1017/S0305000910000346 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the extent and nature of lexical tone deficit in Chinese
      developmental dyslexia. Twenty Cantonese-speaking Chinese dyslexic children (mean
      age 8;11) were compared to twenty average readers of the same age (CA control
      group, mean age 8;11), and another twenty younger average readers of the same
      word reading level (RL control group, mean age 7;4) on different measures of
      lexical tone awareness, rhyme awareness and visual-verbal paired-associate
      learning. Results showed that the Chinese dyslexic children performed
      significantly worse than the CA but not the RL control groups in nearly all the
      lexical tone and rhyme awareness measures. Analyses of individual performance
      demonstrated that over one-third of the dyslexic children showed a deficit in
      some aspects of tone awareness. Tone discrimination and tone production were
      found to correlate significantly with Chinese word reading. These findings
      confirm that Chinese dyslexic children show weaknesses in tone awareness.

TI  - Postural control and automaticity in dyslexic children: the relationship between 
      visual information and body sway.
PG  - 1814-21
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.03.011 [doi]
AB  - Difficulty with literacy acquisition is only one of the symptoms of developmental
      dyslexia. Dyslexic children also show poor motor coordination and postural
      control. Those problems could be associated with automaticity, i.e., difficulty
      in performing a task without dispending a fair amount of conscious efforts. If
      this is the case, dyslexic children would show difficulties in using
      "unperceived" sensory cues to control body sway. Therefore, the aim of the study 
      was to examine postural control performance and the coupling between visual
      information and body sway in dyslexic children. Ten dyslexic children and 10
      non-dyslexic children stood upright inside a moving room that remained stationary
      or oscillated back and forward at frequencies of 0.2 or 0.5 Hz. Body sway
      magnitude and the relationship between the room's movement and body sway were
      examined. The results indicated that dyslexic children oscillated more than
      non-dyslexic children in both stationary and oscillating conditions. Visual
      manipulation induced body sway in all children but the coupling between visual
      information and body sway was weaker and more variable in dyslexic children.
      Based upon these results, we can suggest that dyslexic children use visual
      information to postural control with the same underlying processes as
      non-dyslexic children; however, dyslexic children show poorer performance and
      more variability while relating visual information and motor action even in a
      task that does not require an active cognitive and conscious motor involvement,
      which may be a further evidence of automaticity problem.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine developmental trends in rate
      change detection of auditory rhythmic signals (repetitive sinusoidally frequency 
      modulated tones). METHODS: Two groups of children (9-10 years old and 11-12 years
      old) and one group of young adults performed a rate change detection (RCD) task
      using three types of stimuli. The rate of stimulus modulation was either constant
      (CR), raised by 1 Hz in the middle of the stimulus (RR1) or raised by 2 Hz in the
      middle of the stimulus (RR2). RESULTS: Performance on the RCD task significantly 
      improved with age. Also, the different stimuli showed different developmental
      trajectories. When the RR2 stimulus was used, results showed adult-like
      performance by the age of 10 years but when the RR1 stimulus was used performance
      continued to improve beyond 12 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Rate change detection
      of repetitive sinusoidally frequency modulated tones show protracted development 
      beyond the age of 12 years. Given evidence for abnormal processing of auditory
      rhythmic signals in neurodevelopmental conditions, such as dyslexia, the present 
      methodology might help delineate the nature of these conditions.

AB  - Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a congenital deficit that affects the ability
      to acquire arithmetical skills. Individuals with DD have problems learning
      standard number facts and procedures. Estimates of the prevalence rate of DD are 
      similar to those of developmental dyslexia. Recent reports and discussions
      suggest that those with DD suffer from specific deficits (e.g., subitizing,
      comparative judgment). Accordingly, DD has been described as a domain-specific
      disorder that involves particular brain areas (e.g., intra-parietal sulcus).
      However, we and others have found that DD is characterized by additional
      deficiencies and may be affected by domain-general (e.g., attention) factors.
      Hence "pure DD" might be rather rare and not as pure as one would think. We
      suggest that the heterogeneity of symptoms that commonly characterize learning
      disabilities needs to be taken into account in future research and treatment.

TI  - Which tasks best discriminate between dyslexic university students and controls
      in a transparent language?
PG  - 227-41
LID - 10.1002/dys.431 [doi]
AB  - The need for a battery for testing adult dyslexia, and especially university
      students, is being increasingly recognized in view of the increased number of
      adult requests for a dyslexia examination in relation to both assistance and
      protection from discrimination. The present study examines the discriminative
      validity of a battery we have developed-the Battery for the Assessment of Reading
      and Writing in Adulthood-through comparison of the performance of 24 university
      students with a history of severe developmental dyslexia and 99 controls. All the
      reading, writing, lexical decision and spelling tasks of the battery, except
      omissions in a lexical decision task and reading comprehension, showed a good
      discriminatory power. In addition, use of just two of these tasks (fluency in
      reading a text and spelling under articulatory suppression) gave 87% sensitivity 
      and 97% specificity. Our results confirm that in transparent languages, measures 
      of phonological automaticity are the best indexes of reading decoding competence,
      particularly in adults.

TI  - Predicting dyslexia at age 11 from a risk index questionnaire at age 5.
PG  - 207-26
LID - 10.1002/dys.432 [doi]
AB  - This study focused on predicting dyslexia in children ahead of formal literacy
      training. Because dyslexia is a constitutional impairment, risk factors should be
      seen in preschool. It was hypothesized that data gathered at age 5 using
      questions targeting the dyslexia endophenotype should be reliable and valid
      predictors of dyslexia at age 11. A questionnaire was given to caretakers of 120 
      5-year-old children, and a risk index score was calculated based on questions
      regarding health, laterality, motor skills, language, special needs education and
      heredity. An at-risk group (n = 25) and matched controls (n = 24) were followed
      until age 11, when a similar questionnaire and literacy tests were administered
      to the children who participated in the follow-up study (22 at risk and 20
      control). Half of the at-risk children and two of the control children at age 5
      were identified as having dyslexia at age 11 (8 girls and 5 boys). It is
      concluded that it is possible to identify children at the age of 5 who will have 
      dyslexia at the age of 11 through a questionnaire approach.

TI  - Word frequency effects in the left IFG in dyslexic and normally reading children 
      during picture naming and reading.
PG  - 1212-20
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.033 [doi]
AB  - Word frequency effects have been reported in numerous neuroimaging studies with
      typically reading adults, emphasising the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus
      (LIFG). Within LIFG, different cytoarchitectonic modules (areas 44 and 45) have
      been related to phonological vs. lexico-semantic processing, respectively. This
      fMRI study investigated the differential impact of word frequency on LIFG
      activation in reading and picture naming in primary school children with and
      without developmental dyslexia. All children showed the typical LIFG frequency
      effect in both tasks. The effect was comparable in a fronto-orbital region
      anterior-inferior adjacent to area 45. During reading but not picture naming, a
      second effect was observed in area 44. Here, the fMRI effect for lexical
      frequency was stronger for the dyslexic than the normal readers. These findings
      demonstrate the neural underpinnings of a selective deficit in dyslexic children 
      in the graphemic input lexicon, whereas abstract lexical representations appear
      to be processed equally well in dyslexic and normally reading children. To
      conclude, the present fMRI study demonstrated differential impact of word
      frequency on LIFG activation in primary school children during reading but not
      picture naming. Apart from extending previous knowledge from studies with adults 
      to childhood, the study sheds further light on a potential neural mechanism for
      deficient grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in dyslexic children.

TI  - Auditory sensory deficits in developmental dyslexia: a longitudinal ERP study.
PG  - 723-32
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - The core difficulty in developmental dyslexia across languages is a "phonological
      deficit", a specific difficulty with the neural representation of the sound
      structure of words. Recent data across languages suggest that this phonological
      deficit arises in part from inefficient auditory processing of the rate of change
      of the amplitude envelope at syllable onset (inefficient sensory processing of
      rise time). Rise time is a complex percept that also involves changes in duration
      and perceived intensity. Understanding the neural mechanisms that give rise to
      the phonological deficit in dyslexia is important for optimising educational
      interventions. In a three-deviant passive 'oddball' paradigm and a corresponding 
      blocked 'deviant-alone' control condition we recorded ERPs to tones varying in
      rise time, duration and intensity in children with dyslexia and typically
      developing children longitudinally. We report here results from test Phases 1 and
      2, when participants were aged 8-10 years. We found an MMN to duration, but not
      to rise time nor intensity deviants, at both time points for both groups. For
      rise time, duration and intensity we found group effects in both the Oddball and 
      Blocked conditions. There was a slower fronto-central P1 response in the dyslexic
      group compared to controls. The amplitude of the P1 fronto-centrally to tones
      with slower rise times and lower intensity was smaller compared to tones with
      sharper rise times and higher intensity in the Oddball condition, for children
      with dyslexia only. The latency of this ERP component for all three stimuli was
      shorter on the right compared to the left hemisphere, only for the dyslexic group
      in the Blocked condition. Furthermore, we found decreased N1c amplitude to tones 
      with slower rise times compared to tones with sharper rise times for children
      with dyslexia, only in the Oddball condition. Several other effects of stimulus
      type, age and laterality were also observed. Our data suggest that neuronal
      responses underlying some aspects of auditory sensory processing may be impaired 
      in dyslexia.

TI  - The development of print tuning in children with dyslexia: evidence from
      longitudinal ERP data supported by fMRI.
PG  - 714-22
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.055 [doi]
AB  - A consistent finding in functional brain imaging studies of reading with dyslexia
      is reduced inferior occipito-temporal activation linked to deviant processing of 
      visual word forms. Time-sensitive event-related potentials (ERP) further revealed
      reduced inferior occipito-temporal N1 tuning for print in dyslexic 2nd graders
      suggesting the reduction affects fast processing and the initial development of
      dyslexia. Here, we followed up the same groups with ERP recordings and
      investigated how fast print tuning deficits in dyslexia develop from 2nd to 5th
      grade. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we further
      characterized spatial aspects of print tuning in the 5th grade. The robust N1
      tuning deficit for print in the dyslexic 2nd graders had largely disappeared by
      grade 5 consistent with a developmental delay. Reduced word-specific activation
      in dyslexic 5th grader's fMRI data occurred bilaterally in middle temporal
      regions and in the left posterior superior sulcus. Although no group differences 
      in inferior occipito-temporal regions appeared in the whole brain analysis, a
      region of interest analysis of the Visual Word Form Area revealed that control
      children showed a more lateralized word-specific activation pattern than the
      children with dyslexia. The results suggest that while impaired N1 tuning for
      print plays a major role for dyslexia at the beginning of learning to read, other
      aspects of visual word form processing in the same region remain impaired in
      dyslexic children after several years of reading practice. Overall, neural
      deficits associated with dyslexia appear to be plastic and to change throughout
      development and reading acquisition.

LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.062 [doi]
AB  - Studies in children and adults with the reading disability developmental dyslexia
      have shown behavioral improvements after reading intervention. In another line of
      work, it has been shown that intensive training in a variety of cognitive and
      sensorimotor skills can result in changes in gray matter volume (GMV). This study
      examined changes in GMV following intensive reading intervention in children with
      dyslexia using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Eleven dyslexic children underwent 
      an eight week training focused on mental imagery, articulation and tracing of
      letters, groups of letters and words, which resulted in significant gains in
      reading skills. This was followed by an eight week null period (control) where no
      intervention was administered and no further significant gains in reading were
      observed. Structural scans were obtained before the intervention, after the
      intervention and after the null period. GMV increases between the first two time 
      points were found in the left anterior fusiform gyrus/hippocampus, left
      precuneus, right hippocampus and right anterior cerebellum. However these areas
      did not change between time points two and three (control period), suggesting
      that the changes were specific to the intervention period. These results
      demonstrate for the first time that (1) training-induced changes in GMV can be
      observed in a pediatric sample and (2) reading improvements induced by
      intervention are accompanied by GMV changes.

PG  - 742-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.055 [doi]
AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported reduced activation in
      parietotemporal and occipitotemporal areas in adults and children with
      developmental dyslexia compared to controls during reading and reading related
      tasks. These patterns of regionally reduced activation have been linked to
      behavioral impairments of reading-related processes (e.g., phonological skills
      and rapid automatized naming). The observed functional and behavioral differences
      in individuals with developmental dyslexia have been complemented by reports of
      reduced gray matter in left parietotemporal, occipitotemporal areas, fusiform and
      lingual gyrus and the cerebellum. An important question for education is whether 
      these neural differences are present before reading is taught. Developmental
      dyslexia can only be diagnosed after formal reading education starts. However,
      here we investigate whether the previously detected gray matter alterations in
      adults and children with developmental dyslexia can already be observed in a
      small group of pre-reading children with a family-history of developmental
      dyslexia compared to age and IQ-matched children without a family-history (N =
      20/mean age: 5:9 years; age range 5:1-6:5 years). Voxel-based morphometry
      revealed significantly reduced gray matter volume indices for pre-reading
      children with, compared to children without, a family-history of developmental
      dyslexia in left occipitotemporal, bilateral parietotemporal regions, left
      fusiform gyrus and right lingual gyrus. Gray matter volume indices in left
      hemispheric occipitotemporal and parietotemporal regions of interest also
      correlated positively with rapid automatized naming. No differences between the
      two groups were observed in frontal and cerebellar regions. This discovery in a
      small group of children suggests that previously described functional and
      structural alterations in developmental dyslexia may not be due to
      experience-dependent brain changes but may be present at birth or develop in
      early childhood prior to reading onset. Further studies using larger sample sizes
      and longitudinal analyses are needed in order to determine whether the identified
      structural alterations may be utilized as structural markers for the early
      identification of children at risk, which may prevent the negative clinical,
      social and psychological outcome of developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 1107-18

AB  - Although a deficit perceiving phonemes, as indexed by the mismatch negativity
      (MMN), is apparent in developmental dyslexia (DD), studies have not yet addressed
      whether this deficit might be a result of deficient native language speech
      representations. The present study examines how a native-vowel prototype and an
      atypical vowel are discriminated by 9-year-old children with (n = 14) and without
      (n = 12) DD. MMN was elicited in all conditions in both groups. The control group
      revealed enhanced MMN to the native-vowel prototype in comparison to the atypical
      vowel. Children with DD did not show enhanced MMN amplitude to the native-vowel
      prototype, suggesting impaired tuning to native language speech representations. 
      Furthermore, higher MMN amplitudes to the native-vowel prototype correlated with 
      more advanced reading (r = - .47) and spelling skills (r = - .52).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Manifestations of dyslexia depend on language systems and scripts.
      This study explored the prevalence and clinical features of developmental
      dyslexia among monolingual Persian students and provided insights on mechanisms
      involved in reading Persian. METHODS: To measure reading ability we developed a
      new instrument, Analysis of Persian Reading Ability, which had acceptable
      validity and reliability. A total of 1562 children aged 6 (1/2) - 14 were
      randomly selected from a population of 109696 primary school students in the city
      of Qom, Iran. RESULTS: Using a variety of statistical and clinical criteria, 82
      (5.2%) of the sample were classified as dyslexics. A detailed analysis of reading
      errors revealed eight types of errors related to three categories. The most
      frequent category in both dyslexic and the matched control group was
      phonological, followed by pragmatic and visual errors. CONCLUSION: The observed
      prevalence rate of dyslexia and reading error categories would suggest that
      Persian in vowel-free format is an opaque language and predominant use of a
      sub-lexical strategy is involved when reading Persian.

      following acute neurological deterioration.

AB  - Sturge-Weber syndrome consists of facial capillary malformation (port-wine stain)
      and abnormal blood vessels in the brain or eye. Seizures, developmental delay and
      intracranial and airway angiomata are principal concerns. We report a 28-year-old
      primiparous woman at 41 weeks of gestation with Sturge-Weber syndrome who
      developed unilateral weakness, aphasia, blurred vision and confusion.
      Preeclampsia was excluded. Neuroimaging showed left sided cerebral oedema and a
      right parieto-occipital lesion, most likely an angioma. Caesarean section was
      planned to avoid the risk of angioma rupture during labour. General anesthesia
      was avoided due to the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and reports of
      seizure-related mortality. Despite the possibility of raised intracranial
      pressure and precipitation of cerebral herniation, a lumbar epidural block was
      administered but failed. A subarachnoid block was successfully performed and a
      healthy infant delivered. The choice of anaesthesia was strongly influenced by
      detailed radiological investigations and multidisciplinary participation.

TI  - Neuromotor deficits in developmental coordination disorder: evidence from a
      reach-to-grasp task.
PG  - 1293-300
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.02.007 [doi]
AB  - Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) has been classified as a specific
      learning disability, nonetheless the underlying cognitive mechanisms are still a 
      matter of discussion. After a summary of the main hypotheses on the principal
      neuromotor causes of DCD, this study applies a causal model framework to describe
      the possible coexistence of more than one deficit in this disorder. For this
      purpose, kinematic analysis was applied to an ecological task, the reach-to-grasp
      action, introducing the manipulation of three variables: vision, distance and
      object size. After a thorough neurological and neuropsychological evaluation, 9
      children with DCD (7-9 years old) were selected and compared to 27 age-matched
      control children. The results suggest that children with DCD have a normal
      neurological characterization of the reaching and grasping movements, in terms of
      proximal to distal action, but their grasping aperture (MGA) was always wider
      with respect to controls, particularly when vision was not allowed. In addition, 
      the performance of children with DCD was always slower, more dependent on vision 
      and more variable than that of controls. The MGA of children with DCD could be
      explained by a deficit in the internal construction of movement for a forward
      model, while slowness could be related to a control problem in the neuronal
      firing of the muscles. The idea of a possible coexistence of these two deficits
      is discussed in accordance to a causal model framework and also addressed
      considering recent neurophysiologic evidences.

PG  - 448-53
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.31180 [doi]
AB  - We present a family with mild developmental delay and a duplication (6)(p22.2).
      Array CGH analyses revealed this 0.7 Mb duplication in all three patients,
      spanning candidate genes ALDH5A1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319. Results were confirmed by 
      MLPA analysis of the dyslexia genes DCDC2 and KIAA0319. Of interest, ALDH5A1
      encodes succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), an enzyme responsible for
      gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) degradation. Inherited deficiency of SSADH
      results in accumulation of the neuromodulator gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which 
      likely contributes to some aspects of the neurological phenotype of SSADH
      deficiency (MIM #271980). Based on autosomal-recessive inheritance, we sequenced 
      ALDH5A1 in all patients, which revealed no pathogenic mutations. SSADH enzyme
      studies in cultured white cells confirmed elevated SSADH activity, consistent
      with the duplication, whereas concentrations of SSA were slightly elevated in
      urine, suggesting oxidant stress. We speculate that the duplication (6)(p22.2)
      and corresponding hyperactive level of SSADH activity may have negative
      consequences for GABA metabolism and the role of SSADH in other metabolic
      sequences.

LID - 10.1007/s11881-010-0050-9 [doi]
AB  - Reading fluency beyond decoding is a limitation to many children with
      developmental reading disorders. In the interest of remediating dysfluency,
      contributing factors need to be explored and understood in a developmental
      framework. The focus of this study is orthographic processing in developmental
      dyslexia, and how it may contribute to reading fluency. We investigated
      orthographic processing speed and accuracy by children identified with dyslexia
      that were enrolled in an intensive, fluency-based intervention using a timed
      visual search task as a tool to measure orthographic recognition. Results
      indicate both age and treatment effects, and delineate a link between rapid
      letter naming and efficient orthographic recognition. Orthographic efficiency was
      related to reading speed for passages, but not spelling performance. The role of 
      orthographic learning in reading fluency and remediation is discussed.

TI  - Subtypes of reading disability in a shallow orthography: a double dissociation
      between accuracy-disabled and rate-disabled readers of Hebrew.
PG  - 64-84
LID - 10.1007/s11881-010-0047-4 [doi]
AB  - Whereas most English language sub-typing schemes for dyslexia (e.g., Castles &
      Coltheart, 1993) have focused on reading accuracy for words varying in
      regularity, such an approach may have limited utility for reading disability
      sub-typing beyond English in which fluency rather than accuracy is the key
      discriminator of developmental and individual differences in reading ability. The
      present study investigated the viability of an accuracy/fluency-based typology in
      a regular orthography, pointed Hebrew. We sought evidence of true or "hard"
      accuracy/rate subtypes in the strict (double dissociation) sense of selective
      impairment on only one dimension in the presence of normal levels of performance 
      on the other dimension. In a nationally representative sample of fourth graders, 
      we were able to identify a specific accuracy-disabled sub-group as well as an
      equally specific rate-disabled subgroup. Validating this subdivision, we show
      that the nature of reading performance in these subgroups and their converging
      cognitive/linguistic profiles are unique and distinctive on variables other than 
      the measures used to define them. While the rate-specific disability appeared to 
      reflect a general deficit in speed of processing affecting reading rate, and
      rapid automatized naming of print-related material, the accuracy-only disability 
      subgroup displayed selective deficits in phonological awareness and morphological
      knowledge. Biosocial, demographic, and instructional factors, furthermore, did
      not explain the sub-group differences. It appears that both these subtypes are
      equally prevalent each counting close to 10% of the population.

AB  - The Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) is designed to be objective (so it can be
      administered by a lay native speaker of the language) and equivalent across
      languages (to allow for a comparison between the languages of a given patient as 
      well as across patients from different institutions). It has been used not only
      with aphasia but also with any condition that results in language impairment
      (Alzheimer's, autism, cerebellar lesions, developmental language disorders, mild 
      cognitive impairment, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's,
      vascular dementia, etc.). It has also been used for research purposes on
      non-brain-damaged unilingual and bilingual populations. By means of its 32 tasks,
      it assesses comprehension and production of implicit linguistic competence and
      metalinguistic knowledge (which provide indications for apposite rehabilitation
      strategies). Versions of the BAT are available for free download at
      www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/research/bat/.

TI  - How many functional brains in developmental dyslexia? When the history of
      language delay makes the difference.
PG  - 85-92
LID - 10.1097/WNN.0b013e318222a4c2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestations of developmental dyslexia (DD) are greatly
      variable, suggesting complex underlying mechanisms. It was recently advanced that
      the characteristics of DD in Italian, a language with shallow orthography, are
      influenced by a positive history for language delay. OBJECTIVE: We explored this 
      hypothesis by studying in Italian individuals with DD (i) the brain
      representation of phonological processing with functional magnetic resonance
      imaging and (ii) the correlation between the patterns of activation and the
      presence/absence of previous language delay. METHOD: Thirteen individuals with DD
      and 13 controls participated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging
      experiment consisting of a rhyme-generation task. RESULTS: Individuals with DD
      showed a reduced activation of phonological processing areas of the left
      hemisphere, such as the middle frontal gyrus, the precuneus, and the inferior
      parietal lobule, and in particular the superior temporal gyrus. Furthermore,
      patients with a history of language delay had reduced activation in the left
      inferior and medial frontal gyrus, that was associated with worse reading and
      phonological accuracy than patients with normal language development.
      CONCLUSIONS: Neurofunctional profiles of Italian individuals with DD are
      correlated to the history of language delay, suggesting that the relatively
      better behavioral profiles observed in individuals without a history of language 
      delay are associated with a major activation of frontal networks normally
      involved in phonological working memory.

TI  - Music, rhythm, rise time perception and developmental dyslexia: perception of
      musical meter predicts reading and phonology.
PG  - 674-89
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.07.010 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rhythm organises musical events into patterns and forms, and rhythm
      perception in music is usually studied by using metrical tasks. Metrical
      structure also plays an organisational function in the phonology of language, via
      speech prosody, and there is evidence for rhythmic perceptual difficulties in
      developmental dyslexia. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the accurate
      perception of musical metrical structure is related to basic auditory perception 
      of rise time, and also to phonological and literacy development in children.
      METHODS: A battery of behavioural tasks was devised to explore relations between 
      musical metrical perception, auditory perception of amplitude envelope structure,
      phonological awareness (PA) and reading in a sample of 64 typically-developing
      children and children with developmental dyslexia. RESULTS: We show that
      individual differences in the perception of amplitude envelope rise time are
      linked to musical metrical sensitivity, and that musical metrical sensitivity
      predicts PA and reading development, accounting for over 60% of variance in
      reading along with age and I.Q. Even the simplest metrical task, based on a duple
      metrical structure, was performed significantly more poorly by the children with 
      dyslexia. CONCLUSIONS: The accurate perception of metrical structure may be
      critical for phonological development and consequently for the development of
      literacy. Difficulties in metrical processing are associated with basic auditory 
      rise time processing difficulties, suggesting a primary sensory impairment in
      developmental dyslexia in tracking the lower-frequency modulations in the speech 
      envelope.

TI  - Reduced attentional capacity, but normal processing speed and shifting of
      attention in developmental dyslexia: evidence from a serial task.
PG  - 715-33
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.05.008 [doi]
AB  - We report the performance of a group of adult dyslexics and matched controls in
      an array-matching task where two strings of either consonants or symbols are
      presented side by side and have to be judged to be the same or different. The
      arrays may differ either in the order or identity of two adjacent characters.
      This task does not require naming - which has been argued to be the cause of
      dyslexics' difficulty in processing visual arrays - but, instead, has a strong
      serial component as demonstrated by the fact that, in both groups, Reaction times
      (RTs) increase monotonically with position of a mismatch. The dyslexics are
      clearly impaired in all conditions and performance in the identity conditions
      predicts performance across orthographic tasks even after age, performance IQ and
      phonology are partialled out. Moreover, the shapes of serial position curves are 
      revealing of the underlying impairment. In the dyslexics, RTs increase with
      position at the same rate as in the controls (lines are parallel) ruling out
      reduced processing speed or difficulties in shifting attention. Instead, error
      rates show a catastrophic increase for positions which are either searched later 
      or more subject to interference. These results are consistent with a reduction in
      the attentional capacity needed in a serial task to bind together identity and
      positional information. This capacity is best seen as a reduction in the number
      of spotlights into which attention can be split to process information at
      different locations rather than as a more generic reduction of resources which
      would also affect processing the details of single objects.

PG  - 271-7
LID - 10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.003 [doi]
AB  - The processes by which cortical areas become specialized for high-level cognitive
      functions may be revealed by the study of familial developmental disorders such
      as dyslexia, dyscalculia, prosopagnosia, color agnosia and amusia. These
      disorders are characterised by the inability to integrate information across
      multiple areas and the consequent failure to develop representations of the
      knowledge of some category based on its associated attributes. In contrast,
      synesthesia may be seen as a hyper-associative condition, possibly due to a
      failure to properly segregate areas into distinct networks. Here, I consider
      recent advances in our understanding of the genetic and neurobiological bases of 
      these conditions and the developmental mechanisms underlying the specialization
      of cortical areas and networks.

TI  - Differential diagnosis of behavioral variant of fronto-temporal dementia (bvFTD).
PG  - CR311-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the paper is the differential diagnosis of various types
      of Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), with the focus on its behavioural variant
      (bvFTD). MATERIAL/METHOD: Screening was done in order to assess the depth of
      dementia with the short version of MMSE, while evaluation of various variants of 
      FTD was performed with the use of such neuropsychological tests as Newcomb and
      Chicago Fluency Tests, Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III), Western Aphasia
      Battery (WAB-R), and the Boston Naming Test (BNT). Behaviour was evaluated with a
      Polish version of the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBInv). The inventory
      consists of 24 questions which enable an evaluation of social behaviour
      disorders. The study included 112 patients--68 men and 46 women treated in the
      Reintegrative-Training Centre of the Foundation for Persons with Brain
      Dysfunctions in Krakow and in the Clinic for Developmental Psychiatry, Psychotic 
      Disorders and Old Age Psychiatry, of the Medical University at Gdansk, who were
      suffering from various types of dementia. RESULTS: It was found that FTD patients
      scored the highest, while the VAD patients scored somewhat lower in the FBInv. At
      the same time the scores obtained by PPA patients were higher in comparison to
      the control groups, but not as high as in the case of patients with FTD. In the
      process of the neurotherapy of FTD patients we found a reduction of the
      behavioral disturbances, despite the progression of the illness. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results obtained in the present study confirmed the diagnostic value of FBInv in 
      the differential diagnosis of various types of FTD and in the evaluation of
      neurotherapy efficacy.

      Italian dyslexics.
PG  - 1718-29
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.02.050 [doi]
AB  - Although developmental dyslexia is often referred to as a cross-modal
      disturbance, tests of different modalities using the same stimuli are lacking. We
      compared the performance of 23 children with dyslexia and 42 chronologically
      matched control readers on reading versus repetition tasks and visual versus
      auditory lexical decision using the same stimuli. With respect to control
      readers, children with dyslexia were impaired only on stimuli in the visual
      modality; they had no deficit on the repetition and auditory lexical decision
      tasks. By applying the rate-amount model (Faust et al., 1999), we showed that
      performance of children with dyslexia on visual (but not auditory) tasks was
      associated with that of control readers by a linear relationship (with a 1.78
      slope), suggesting that a global factor accounts for visual (but not auditory)
      task performance. We conclude that the processing of linguistic stimuli in the
      visual and auditory modalities is carried out by independent processes and that
      dyslexic children have a selective deficit in the visual modality.

AB  - The ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT) is involved in the perception of
      visually presented objects and written words. The Interactive Account of vOT
      function is based on the premise that perception involves the synthesis of
      bottom-up sensory input with top-down predictions that are generated
      automatically from prior experience. We propose that vOT integrates visuospatial 
      features abstracted from sensory inputs with higher level associations such as
      speech sounds, actions and meanings. In this context, specialization for
      orthography emerges from regional interactions without assuming that vOT is
      selectively tuned to orthographic features. We discuss how the Interactive
      Account explains left vOT responses during normal reading and developmental
      dyslexia; and how it accounts for the behavioural consequences of left vOT
      damage.

TI  - Reading, Laterality, and the Brain: Early Contributions on Reading Disabilities
      by Sara S. Sparrow.
AB  - Although best known for work with children and adults with intellectual
      disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, training in speech pathology and a
      doctorate in clinical psychology and neuropsychology was the foundation for Sara 
      Sparrow's long-term interest in reading disabilities. Her first papers were on
      dyslexia and laterality, and the maturational lag theory of developmental
      dyslexia proposed with Paul Satz, her mentor. The research program that emerged
      from this work had a wide impact on early neuropsychological models of reading
      disabilities. Although Sara went on to research focused on children with other
      developmental disabilities after she moved to Yale University, this initial
      research influenced her career- long interests in assessment, developmental
      models of disabilities, and early screening methods.

AB  - Evidence suggests that sensitivity to coherent motion (CM) is related to reading,
      but its role in the etiology of developmental dyslexia remains unclear. In this
      longitudinal study, CM sensitivity was measured in 31 children at family risk for
      dyslexia and 31 low-risk controls. Children, diagnosed with dyslexia in third
      grade (mean age=8 years 3 months), demonstrated reduced CM sensitivity in
      kindergarten (mean age=5 years 8 months), before they had learned to read.
      Preschool CM thresholds in controls also uniquely predicted future literacy
      achievement. When reassessed in first grade, CM sensitivity in the dyslexic
      children was age appropriate, and CM thresholds in the controls no longer
      predicted literacy acquisition. These findings contribute to the debate about the
      developmental relations between visual processing and reading acquisition.

TI  - A multiple deficit model of reading disability and

      deficits.
PG  - 547-57
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02346.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study tests a multiple cognitive deficit model of reading
      disability (RD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and their
      comorbidity. METHODS: A structural equation model (SEM) of multiple cognitive
      risk factors and symptom outcome variables was constructed. The model included
      phonological awareness as a unique predictor of RD and response inhibition as a
      unique predictor of ADHD. Processing speed, naming speed, and verbal working
      memory were modeled as potential shared cognitive deficits. RESULTS: Model fit
      indices from the SEM indicated satisfactory fit. Closer inspection of the path
      weights revealed that processing speed was the only cognitive variable with
      significant unique relationships to RD and ADHD dimensions, particularly
      inattention. Moreover, the significant correlation between reading and
      inattention was reduced to non-significance when processing speed was included in
      the model, suggesting that processing speed primarily accounted for the
      phenotypic correlation (or comorbidity) between reading and inattention.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the power of a multiple deficit approach to
      complex developmental disorders and psychopathologies, particularly for exploring
      comorbidities. The theoretical role of processing speed in the developmental
      pathways of RD and ADHD and directions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Reading for sound with dyslexia: evidence for early orthographic and late
      phonological integration deficits.
PG  - 192-205
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.02.012 [doi]
AB  - Deteriorated phonological representations are widely assumed to be the underlying
      cause of reading difficulties in developmental dyslexia; however, existing
      evidence also implicates degraded orthographic processing. Here, we used
      event-related potentials whilst dyslexic and control adults performed a
      pseudoword-word priming task requiring deep phonological analysis to examine
      phonological and orthographic priming, respectively. Pseudowords were manipulated
      to be homophonic or non-homophonic to a target word and more or less
      orthographically similar. Since previous ERP research with normal readers has
      established phonologically driven differences as early as 250 ms from word
      presentation, degraded phonological representations were expected to reveal
      reduced phonological priming in dyslexic readers from 250 ms after target word
      onset. However, phonological priming main effects in both the N2 and P3 ranges
      were indistinguishable in amplitude between groups. Critically, we found group
      differences in the N1 range, such that orthographic modulations observed in
      controls were absent in the dyslexic group. Furthermore, early group differences 
      in phonological priming transpired as interactions with orthographic priming (in 
      P2, N2 and P3 ranges). A group difference in phonological priming did not emerge 
      until the P600 range, in which the dyslexic group showed significantly attenuated
      priming. As the P600 is classically associated with online monitoring and
      reanalysis, this pattern of results suggest that during deliberate phonological
      processing, the phonological deficit in reading may relate more to inefficient
      monitoring rather than deficient detection. Meanwhile, early differences in
      perceptual processing of phonological information may be driven by the strength
      of engagement with orthographic information.

PG  - 599-608

AB  - Children with developmental dyslexia suffer from delayed reading capabilities and
      may also exhibit attentional and sensori-motor deficits. The objective of this
      study was twofold. First, we aimed at investigating whether integration of
      proprioceptive signals in balance control was more impaired in dyslexic children 
      when the attentional demand was varied. Secondly, we checked whether this effect 
      was reduced significantly by using a specific treatment to improve eye control
      deficits and certain postural signs that are often linked to dyslexia (Quercia et
      al. in J Fr Ophtalmol 28:713-723, 2005, J Fr Ophtalmol 30:380-89, 2007). Thirty
      dyslexic and 51 treated dyslexic children (> 3 months of treatment) were compared
      with 42 non-dyslexic children in several conditions (mean age: 136.2 +/- 23.6,
      132.2 +/- 18.7 and 140.2 +/- 25 months, respectively). Co-vibration of ankle
      muscles was effected in order to alter proprioceptive information originating
      from the ankle. In two vibration conditions, ankle muscles were either not
      vibrated or vibrated at 85 Hz without illusion of any movement. These two
      vibration conditions were combined with two attentional conditions. In the first 
      such condition, children maintained balance while merely fixing their gaze on a
      point in front of them. In the second condition, they had to look for smaller or 
      larger stars in a panel showing forty of each kind. Balance was assessed by means
      of a force plate. Results indicated that the mean velocity (i.e. the total
      length) of the center of pressure (CoP) displacement in the 85-Hz vibration
      condition increased significantly more (compared with no vibration) in the
      dyslexic and the treated dyslexic groups than in the control group, irrespective 
      of the attention task. Interestingly, in the condition without vibration, the
      attentional performance of treated children was similar to that of the control
      group, whereas the attentional performance of the untreated dyslexic children was
      significantly impaired. Altogether, these results suggest that integration of
      proprioceptive signals in balance control and attentional capacity are impaired
      in dyslexic children. However, attention capacity during the control of stance
      could be improved significantly.

TI  - Visuospatial deficits of dyslexic children.
PG  - CR216-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: The visuospatial deficit is recognized as typical for dyslexia only
      in some definitions. However problems with visuospatial orientation may manifest 
      themselves as difficulties with letter identification or the memorizing and
      recalling of sign sequences, something frequently experienced by dyslexics.
      MATERIAL/METHODS: The experimental group consisted of 62 children with
      developmental dyslexia. The control group consisted of 67 pupils with no
      diagnosed deficits, matched to the clinical group in terms of age. We used the
      Clock Drawing Test (CDT), the Spatial Span subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale
      - third edition (WMS - III), the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test in order to
      analyze visuospatial functioning. RESULTS: The results show that dyslexics
      experienced problems with visuospatial functioning, however only while performing
      difficult tasks. Significant group differences were found for the Clock Drawing
      Test, Spatial Span - Backward and the precision of figure coping in the
      Rey-Osterrieth Test. In addition, the results of dyslexic boys were lower than
      those obtained by all other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide support for
      the hypothesis concerning visual deficit as characteristic for dyslexia.

      strong heritable component. Previous studies using different genetic approaches
      have identified several genetic loci and candidate genes for dyslexia. In this
      article, we have integrated the current knowledge on 14 dyslexia candidate genes 
      suggested by cytogenetic findings, linkage and association studies. We found that
      10 of the 14 dyslexia candidate genes (ROBO1, KIAA0319, KIAA0319L, S100B, DOCK4, 
      FMR1, DIP2A, GTF2I, DYX1C1 and DCDC2) fit into a theoretical molecular network
      involved in neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Based on this, we also
      propose three novel dyslexia candidate genes (SLIT2, HMGB1 and VAPA) from known
      linkage regions, and we discuss the possible involvement of genes emerging from
      the two reported genome-wide association studies for reading impairment-related
      phenotypes in the identified network.

TI  - Dyslexia and handedness: developmental phonological and surface dyslexias are
      associated with different biases for handedness.
PG  - 417-25
AB  - Developmental disorders of reading and spelling have long been associated with
      increased left- and mixed-handedness but the evidence has been controversial. The
      right shift (RS) theory of handedness and cerebral dominance, developed by Annett
      from 1972 onward, offers resolutions to several puzzles about laterality in the
      so-called dyslexias. This review of findings in the light of the theory shows
      that "phonological" dyslexics are less likely to be right-handed, while "surface"
      or "dyseidetic" dyslexics are more likely to be right-handed than the general
      population.

PG  - 148-58
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.01.040 [doi]
AB  - Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) are associated with neurological disorders and
      cognitive impairments in humans. Molecular layer ectopia, clusters of misplaced
      cells in layer I of the neocortex, have been identified in patients with
      developmental dyslexia and psychomotor retardation. Mouse models of this
      developmental disorder display behavioral impairments and increased seizure
      susceptibility. Although there is a correlation between cortical malformations
      and neurological dysfunction, little is known about the morphological and
      physiological properties of cells within cortical malformations. In the present
      study we used electrophysiological and immunocytochemical analyses to examine the
      distribution of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types within and surrounding layer
      I neocortical ectopia in NXSMD/EiJ mice. We show that cells within ectopia have
      membrane properties of both pyramidal and a variety of non-pyramidal cell types, 
      including fast-spiking cells. Immunocytochemical analysis for different
      interneuronal subtypes demonstrates that ectopia contain nonpyramidal cells
      immunoreactive for calbindin-D28K (CALB), parvalbumin (PARV), and calretinin
      (CR). Ectopia also contains astrocytes, positive for glial fibrillary acidic
      protein (GFAP) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells positive for NG2 proteoglycan 
      (NG2). Lastly, we provide electrophysiological and morphological evidence to
      demonstrate that cells within ectopia receive input from cells within layers I,
      upper and deeper II/III, and V and provide outputs to cells within deep layer
      II/III and layer V, but not layers I and upper II/III. These results indicate
      that ectopia contain cells of different lineages with diverse morphological and
      physiological properties, and appear to cause disruptions in local cortical
      circuitry.

      case report.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/1748-7161-6-3 [doi]
AB  - Cavernous hemangioma consists mainly of congenital vascular malformations present
      before birth and gradually increasing in size with skeletal growth. A small
      number of patients with cavernous hemangioma develop scoliosis, and surgical
      treatment for the scoliosis in such cases has not been reported to date. Here we 
      report a 12-year-old male patient with severe progressive scoliosis due to a huge
      subcutaneous cavernous hemangioma, who underwent posterior correction and fusion 
      surgery. Upon referral to our department, radiographs revealed a scoliosis of 85 
      degrees at T6-L1 and a kyphosis of 58 degrees at T4-T10. CT and MR images
      revealed a huge hemangioma extending from the subcutaneous region to the
      paraspinal muscles and the retroperitoneal space and invading the spinal canal.
      Posterior correction and fusion surgery using pedicle screws between T2 and L3
      were performed. Massive hemorrhage from the hemangioma occurred during the
      surgery, with intraoperative blood loss reaching 2800 ml. The scoliosis was
      corrected to 59 degrees , and the kyphosis to 45 degrees after surgery. Seven
      hours after surgery, the patient suffered from hypovolemic shock and disseminated
      intravascular coagulation due to postoperative hemorrhage from the hemangioma.
      The patient developed sensory and conduction aphasia caused by cerebral hypoxia
      during the shock on the day of the surgery. At present, two years after the
      surgery, although the patient has completely recovered from the aphasia. This
      case illustrates that, in correction surgery for scoliosis due to huge
      subcutaneous cavernous hemangioma, intraoperative and postoperative intensive
      care for hemodynamics should be performed, since massive hemorrhage can occur
      during the postoperative period as well as the intraoperative period.

TI  - Heritability estimation for speech-sound traits with developmental trajectories.
PG  - 184-91
LID - 10.1007/s10519-010-9378-5 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have examined genetic influences on developmental problems such 
      as speech sound disorders (SSD), language impairment (LI), and reading
      disability. Disorders such as SSD are often analyzed using their component
      endophenotypes. Most studies, however, have involved comparisons of twin pairs or
      siblings of similar age, or have adjusted for age ignoring effects that are
      peculiar to age-related trajectories for phenotypic change. Such developmental
      changes in these skills have limited the usefulness of data from parents or
      siblings who differ substantially in age from the probands. Employing
      parent-offspring correlation in heritability estimation permits a more precise
      estimate of the additive component of genetic variance, but different generations
      have to be measured for the same trait. We report on a smoothing procedure which 
      fits a series of lines that approximate a curve matching the developmental
      trajectory. This procedure adjusts for changes in measures with age, so that the 
      adjusted values are on a similar scale for children, adolescents, and adults. We 
      apply this method to four measures of phonological memory and articulation in
      order to estimate their heritability. Repetition of multisyllabic real words
      (MSW) showed the best heritability estimate of 45% in this sample. We conclude
      that differences in measurement scales across the age span can be reconciled
      through non-linear modeling of the developmental process.

AB  - Disruptions in the development of the neocortex are associated with cognitive
      deficits in humans and other mammals. Several genes contribute to neocortical
      development, and research into the behavioral phenotype associated with specific 
      gene manipulations is advancing rapidly. Findings include evidence that variants 
      in the human gene DYX1C1 may be associated with an increased risk of
      developmental dyslexia. Concurrent research has shown that the rat homolog for
      this gene modulates critical parameters of early cortical development, including 
      neuronal migration. Moreover, recent studies have shown auditory processing and
      spatial learning deficits in rats following in utero transfection of an RNA
      interference (RNAi) vector of the rat homolog Dyx1c1 gene. The current study
      examined the effects of in utero RNAi of Dyx1c1 on working memory performance in 
      Sprague-Dawley rats. This task was chosen based on the evidence of short-term
      memory deficits in dyslexic populations, as well as more recent evidence of an
      association between memory deficits and DYX1C1 anomalies in humans. Working
      memory performance was assessed using a novel match-to-place radial water maze
      task that allows the evaluation of memory for a single brief ( approximately 4-10
      seconds) swim to a new goal location each day. A 10-min retention interval was
      used, followed by a test trial. Histology revealed migrational abnormalities and 
      laminar disruption in Dyx1c1 RNAi-treated rats. Dyx1c1 RNAi-treated rats
      exhibited a subtle, but significant and persistent impairment in working memory
      as compared to Shams. These results provide further support for the role of
      Dyx1c1 in neuronal migration and working memory.

TI  - [Which phonological memory measure distinguishes children with from children
      without auditory processing disorders? A group analysis].
PG  - 292-300
LID - 10.1007/s00106-010-2198-3 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to compare performance in phonological working
      memory across children with auditory processing disorders (APD), partly
      associated with different developmental disorders, and to examine which memory
      measure distinguishes children with from children without APD. METHOD: Data from 
      a health care research database were retrospectively analyzed. All children
      completed three measures of phonological serial recall: one-syllable digits,
      one-syllable words, and multi-syllabic nonwords of increasing length (2-6
      syllables). PARTICIPANTS: The study included 48 subjects with APD only (mean age:
      87.9 months; SD 12.9 months); 35 with co-occurring APD and developmental language
      disorder (DLD) (mean age: 82.2; SD 13.4); 16 with co-occurring APD and dyslexia
      (mean age: 109.2; 18.7); 10 with co-occurring slight intelligence reduction and
      APD (mean age: 102.4; SD 12.5), while 13 were non-affected, typically forming
      controls (non-APD; mean age: 86.0; SD 16.1). The mean intelligence (T-score) of
      the first three mentioned APD groups and the controls were significantly
      different (p<0.0001) from the children with lowered intelligence and APD (35.4;
      SD 3.1). RESULTS: Mean performance in all three verbal memory measures was
      significantly different from the controls in children with DLD+APD (digit span:
      p=0.0009; word span: p=0.0012; nonwords: p=0.05) and children with APD only
      (digit span: p=0.0037; word span: p=0.0006; non words: p=0.05). The set of memory
      measures (excluding the small and older group with lowered intelligence) went
      into a stepwise discriminate analysis. A significant group separation APD vs.
      non-APD was made by the subvocal rehearsal component of the phonological loop, as
      indicated by word span (F=14.40; p=0.0002) and digit span (F=2.87; p=0.0932). The
      rate of misclassification was 23%. CONCLUSION: The present results raise the
      question of the validity of APD diagnostics which includes the phonological
      working memory on principle. It remains controversial whether the assessment of

AB  - Children with specific language impairment (SLI) have often been reported to have
      associated behavioral, emotional and social difficulties. Most previous studies
      involve observations at a single time point, or cross sectional designs, and
      longitudinal evidence of the developmental trajectories of particular
      difficulties is limited. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to
      measure behavioral (hyperactivity and conduct), emotional and social (peer)
      problems in a sample of individuals with a history of SLI at four time points
      from childhood (age 7) to adolescence (age 16). A decrease in behavioral and
      emotional problems was observed from childhood to adolescence, although emotional
      problems were still evident in adolescence. In contrast, there was an increase in
      social problems. Reading skills and expressive language were related only to
      behavioral problems. Pragmatic abilities were related to behavioral, emotional
      and social difficulties. As a group, those with a history of SLI have poorer long
      term social and, to a lesser extent, emotional outcomes. In contrast, behavioral 
      difficulties appear to decrease to normative levels by adolescence. Different
      aspects of early language abilities and reading skills exert different types and 
      degrees of influence on behavioral, emotional and social difficulties. Learning
      outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) understand the types of behavioral,
      emotional and social difficulties present in individuals with a history of SLI;
      (2) be familiar with the developmental trajectory of these difficulties from
      childhood to adolescence; and (3) understand the relationships between
      behavioral, emotional and social difficulties and early language and literacy
      ability.

AB  - Programmatic, multidisciplinary research provided converging brain, genetic, and 
      developmental support for evidence-based diagnoses of three specific learning
      disabilities based on hallmark phenotypes (behavioral expression of underlying
      genotypes) with treatment relevance: dysgraphia (impaired legible automatic
      letter writing, orthographic coding, and finger sequencing), dyslexia (impaired
      pseudoword reading, spelling, phonological and orthographic coding, rapid
      automatic naming, and executive functions; inhibition and rapid automatic
      switching), and oral and written language learning disability (same impairments
      as dyslexia plus morphological and syntactic coding and comprehension). Two case 
      studies illustrate how these differential diagnoses can be made within a
      conceptual framework of a working memory architecture and generate treatment
      plans that transformed treatment nonresponders into treatment responders.
      Findings are discussed in reference to the importance of (a) considering
      individual differences (diagnosis of impaired hallmark phenotypes) in planning
      and evaluating response to instruction and modifying instruction when a student
      is not responding; (b) recognizing that teaching may change epigenetic gene
      expression at one stage of schooling, but not the underlying gene sequences that 
      render individuals still vulnerable as curriculum requirements increase in
      nature, complexity, and volume in the upper grades; and (c) using evidence-based 
      diagnoses of specific learning disabilities that are consistent across states for
      free and appropriate education K to 12 and for accommodations throughout higher
      education and professional credentialing.

PG  - 136-49
LID - 10.1177/0022219410391186 [doi]
AB  - In this study, 123 children with a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia were
      assigned to different treatment groups, either variations of Bakker's
      intervention program based on the balance model or a control, a specific reading 
      training group. Thorough cognitive and neuropsychological assessment allowed
      determination of the subtype of dyslexia according to the balance model and the
      neuropsychological profile with respect to reading and spelling abilities, verbal
      memory, and phonemic awareness. Characteristics of hemisphere-specific
      stimulation were systematically manipulated in an effort to shed light on the
      bases and mechanisms of reading improvement. It was shown that the effects of
      treatment vary according to type of dyslexia and that the different intervention 
      programs have differential effects on reading-related neuropsychological
      functions. Since opposite effects can be produced by the same type of treatment
      in different dyslexia subtypes, the results of the study suggest that accurate
      classification of subtype on the base of reading and reading-related variables is
      advantageous for an optimal planning of the therapy.

      children at risk of developmental dyslexia: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 105-22
LID - 10.1177/0022219410391188 [doi]
AB  - This longitudinal study focused on the effects of two different principles of
      intervention in children at risk of developing dyslexia from 5 to 8 years old.
      The children were selected on the basis of a background questionnaire given to
      parents and preschool teachers, with cognitive and functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging results substantiating group differences in neuropsychological processes 
      associated with phonology, orthography, and phoneme-grapheme correspondence
      (i.e., alphabetic principle). The two principles of intervention were bottom-up
      (BU), "from sound to meaning", and top-down (TD), "from meaning to sound." Thus, 
      four subgroups were established: risk/BU, risk/TD, control/BU, and control/TD.
      Computer-based training took place for 2 months every spring, and cognitive
      assessments were performed each fall of the project period. Measures of
      preliteracy skills for reading and spelling were phonological awareness, working 
      memory, verbal learning, and letter knowledge. Literacy skills were assessed by
      word reading and spelling. At project end the control group scored significantly 
      above age norm, whereas the risk group scored within the norm. In the at-risk
      group, training based on the BU principle had the strongest effects on
      phonological awareness and working memory scores, whereas training based on the
      TD principle had the strongest effects on verbal learning, letter knowledge, and 
      literacy scores. It was concluded that appropriate, specific, data-based
      intervention starting in preschool can mitigate literacy impairment and that
      interventions should contain BU training for preliteracy skills and TD training
      for literacy training.

PG  - 3-27
LID - 10.1007/s11689-010-9059-y [doi]
AB  - This review provides an overview of the involvement of the corpus callosum (CC)
      in a variety of developmental disorders that are currently defined exclusively by
      genetics, developmental insult, and/or behavior. I begin with a general review of
      CC development, connectivity, and function, followed by discussion of the
      research methods typically utilized to study the callosum. The bulk of the review
      concentrates on specific developmental disorders, beginning with agenesis of the 
      corpus callosum (AgCC)-the only condition diagnosed exclusively by callosal
      anatomy. This is followed by a review of several genetic disorders that commonly 
      result in social impairments and/or psychopathology similar to AgCC
      (neurofibromatosis-1, Turner syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Williams
      yndrome, and fragile X) and two forms of prenatal injury (premature birth, fetal 
      alcohol syndrome) known to impact callosal development. Finally, I examine
      callosal involvement in several common developmental disorders defined
      exclusively by behavioral patterns (developmental language delay, dyslexia,
      attention-deficit hyperactive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Tourette
      syndrome).

TI  - Impairments in speech and nonspeech sound categorization in children with
      dyslexia are driven by temporal processing difficulties.
PG  - 593-603
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.015 [doi]
AB  - Auditory processing problems in persons with dyslexia are still subject to
      debate, and one central issue concerns the specific nature of the deficit. In
      particular, it is questioned whether the deficit is specific to speech and/or
      specific to temporal processing. To resolve this issue, a categorical perception 
      identification task was administered in thirteen 11-year old dyslexic readers and
      25 matched normal readers using 4 sound continua: (1) a speech contrast
      exploiting temporal cues (/bA/-/dA/), (2) a speech contrast defined by
      nontemporal spectral cues (/u/-/y/), (3) a nonspeech temporal contrast
      (spectrally rotated/bA/-/da/), and (4) a nonspeech nontemporal contrast
      (spectrally rotated/u/-/y/). Results indicate that children with dyslexia are
      less consistent in classifying speech and nonspeech sounds on the basis of
      rapidly changing (i.e., temporal) information whereas they are unimpaired in
      steady-state speech and nonspeech sounds. The deficit is thus restricted to
      categorizing sounds on the basis of temporal cues and is independent of the
      speech status of the stimuli. The finding of a temporal-specific but not
      speech-specific deficit in children with dyslexia is in line with findings
      obtained in adults using the same paradigm (Vandermosten et al., 2010,
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 
      107: 10389-10394). Comparison of the child and adult data indicates that the
      consistency of categorization considerably improves between late childhood and
      adulthood, particularly for the continua with temporal cues. Dyslexic and normal 
      readers show a similar developmental progress with the dyslexic readers lagging
      behind both in late childhood and in adulthood.

      predict future reading problems.
PG  - 560-70
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.020 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by severe reading and spelling
      difficulties that are persistent and resistant to the usual didactic measures and
      remedial efforts. It is well established that a major cause of these problems
      lies in poorly specified phonological representations. Many individuals with
      dyslexia also present impairments in auditory temporal processing and speech
      perception, but it remains debated whether these more basic perceptual
      impairments play a role in causing the reading problem. Longitudinal studies may 
      help clarifying this issue by assessing preschool children before they receive
      reading instruction and by following them up through literacy development. The
      current longitudinal study shows impairments in auditory frequency modulation
      (FM) detection, speech perception and phonological awareness in kindergarten and 
      in grade 1 in children who receive a dyslexia diagnosis in grade 3. FM
      sensitivity and speech-in-noise perception in kindergarten uniquely contribute to
      growth in reading ability, even after controlling for letter knowledge and
      phonological awareness. These findings indicate that impairments in auditory
      processing and speech perception are not merely an epiphenomenon of reading
      failure. Although no specific directional relations were observed between
      auditory processing, speech perception and phonological awareness, the highly
      significant concurrent and predictive correlations between all these variables
      suggest a reciprocal association and corroborate the evidence for the auditory
      deficit theory of dyslexia.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both monkey and human neuroimaging studies show that visual
      processing beyond the striate cortex involves a highly complex network of regions
      with modular functions. Lesions within this network lead to specific clinical
      syndromes. In this review we discuss studies on blindsight, which is the ability 
      of remaining regions to support vision in the absence of striate cortex or visual
      awareness, recent work on 'ventral stream' syndromes such as object agnosia,
      alexia, prosopagnosia, and topographagnosia, which follow damage to medial
      occipitotemporal structures, and simultanagnosia, the classic 'dorsal stream'
      deficit related to bilateral occipitoparietal lesions. RECENT FINDINGS: We
      highlight work on the anatomic basis of blindsight, the recent description of the
      new disorder developmental topographic disorientation, and studies contrasting
      global and local perception in simultanagnosia. SUMMARY: These studies advance
      our understanding of the mechanisms of complex visual processing and provide an
      important neuropsychological complement to our expanding knowledge about vision
      from functional neuroimaging.

TI  - Unilateral implicit motor learning deficit in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/00207594.2010.509800 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that developmental dyslexia involves various literacy,
      sensory, motor skill, and processing speed deficits. Some recent studies have
      shown that individuals with developmental dyslexia exhibit implicit motor
      learning deficits, which may be related to cerebellar functioning. However,
      previous studies on implicit motor learning in developmental dyslexics have
      produced conflicting results. Findings from cerebellar lesion patients have shown
      that patients' implicit motor learning performance varied when different hands
      were used to complete tasks. This suggests that dyslexia may have different
      effects on implicit motor learning between the two hands if cerebellar
      dysfunction is involved. To specify this question, we used a one-handed version
      of a serial reaction time task to compare the performance of 27 Chinese children 
      with developmental dyslexics with another 27 age-matched children without reading
      difficulties. All the subjects were students from two primary schools, Grades 4
      to 6. The results showed that children with developmental dyslexic responded more
      slowly than nondyslexic children, and exhibited no implicit motor learning in the
      condition of left-hand response. In contrast, there was no significant difference
      in reaction time between two groups of children when they used the right hand to 
      respond. This finding indicates that children with developmental dyslexia
      exhibited normal motor skill and implicit motor learning ability provided the
      right hand was used. Taken together, these results suggested that Chinese
      children with developmental dyslexia exhibit unilateral deficits in motor skill
      and implicit motor learning in the left hand. Our findings lend partial support
      to the cerebellar deficit theory of developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Developmental trajectories of reading development and impairment from ages 3 to 8
      years in Chinese children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early prediction of reading disabilities in Chinese is important for 
      early remediation efforts. In this 6-year longitudinal study, we investigated the
      early cognitive predictors of reading skill in a statistically representative
      sample of Chinese children from Beijing. METHOD: Two hundred sixty-one (261)
      native Chinese children were administered seven language-related skills over
      three years between the ages of 3 and 6 years. Performances on these skills were 
      then examined in relation to subsequent word reading accuracy and fluency.
      Individual differences in developmental profiles across tasks were then estimated
      using growth mixture modeling. RESULTS: Four developmental trajectories were
      classified - the typical (control), catch-up (with low initial cognitive
      performances but adequate subsequent reading), literacy-related-cognitive-delay
      (with difficulties in morphological awareness, phonological awareness, and
      speeded naming and subsequent word recognition), and language-delay (relatively
      low across all tasks) groups. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the combination
      of phonological awareness, rapid naming and morphological awareness are essential
      in the early prediction of later reading difficulties in Chinese children.

TI  - Early predictors of dyslexia in Chinese children: familial history of dyslexia,
      language delay, and cognitive profiles.
PG  - 204-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02299.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This work tested the rates at which Chinese children with either
      language delay or familial history of dyslexia at age 5 manifested dyslexia at
      age 7, identified which cognitive skills at age 5 best distinguished children
      with and without dyslexia at age 7, and examined how these early abilities
      predicted subsequent literacy skills. METHOD: Forty-seven at-risk children (21
      who were initially language delayed and 26 with familial risk) and 47 control
      children matched on age, IQ, and mothers' education were tested on syllable
      awareness, tone detection, rapid automatized naming, visual skill, morphological 
      awareness, and word reading at age 5 and subsequently tested for dyslexia on a
      standard Hong Kong measure at age 7. RESULTS: Of those with an early language
      delay, 62% subsequently manifested dyslexia; for those with familial risk, the
      rate of dyslexia was 50%. Those with dyslexia were best distinguished from those 
      without dyslexia by the age-5 measures of morphological awareness, rapid
      automatized naming, and word reading itself; other measures did not distinguish
      the groups. In a combined regression analysis across all participants,
      morphological awareness uniquely explained word reading accuracy and rapid
      automatized naming uniquely explained timed word reading at age 7, with all other
      measures statistically controlled. Separate stepwise regression analyses by group
      indicated that visual skill uniquely explained subsequent literacy skills in the 
      at-risk group only, whereas tone and syllable awareness were unique predictors of
      literacy skills in the control group only. CONCLUSIONS: Both early language delay
      and familial risk strongly overlap with subsequent dyslexia in Chinese children. 
      Overall, rapid automatized naming and morphological awareness are relatively
      strong correlates of developmental dyslexia in Chinese; visual skill and
      phonological awareness may also be uniquely associated with subsequent literacy
      development in at-risk and typically developing children, respectively.

AB  - Studies in sensory neuroscience reveal the critical importance of accurate
      sensory perception for cognitive development. There is considerable debate
      concerning the possible sensory correlates of phonological processing, the
      primary cognitive risk factor for developmental dyslexia. Across languages,
      children with dyslexia have a specific difficulty with the neural representation 
      of the phonological structure of speech. The identification of a robust sensory
      marker of phonological difficulties would enable early identification of risk for
      developmental dyslexia and early targeted intervention. Here, we explore whether 
      phonological processing difficulties are associated with difficulties in
      processing acoustic cues to speech rhythm. Speech rhythm is used across languages
      by infants to segment the speech stream into words and syllables. Early
      difficulties in perceiving auditory sensory cues to speech rhythm and prosody
      could lead developmentally to impairments in phonology. We compared matched
      samples of children with and without dyslexia, learning three very different
      spoken and written languages, English, Spanish, and Chinese. The key sensory cue 
      measured was rate of onset of the amplitude envelope (rise time), known to be
      critical for the rhythmic timing of speech. Despite phonological and orthographic
      differences, for each language, rise time sensitivity was a significant predictor
      of phonological awareness, and rise time was the only consistent predictor of
      reading acquisition. The data support a language-universal theory of the neural
      basis of developmental dyslexia on the basis of rhythmic perception and syllable 
      segmentation. They also suggest that novel remediation strategies on the basis of
      rhythm and music may offer benefits for phonological and linguistic development.

AB  - Inhibitory ability of children with developmental dyscalculia (DD) was
      investigated to explore the cognitive mechanism underlying DD. According to the
      definition of developmental dyscalculia, 19 children with DD-only and 10 children
      with DD&RD (DD combined with reading disability) were selected step by step,
      children in two control groups were matched with children in case groups by
      gender and age, and the match ratio was 1:1. Psychological testing software named
      DMDX was used to measure inhibitory ability of the subjects. The differences of
      reaction time in number Stroop tasks and differences of accuracy in incongruent
      condition of color-word Stroop tasks and object inhibition tasks between DD-only 
      children and their controls reached significant levels (P<0.05), and the
      differences of reaction time in number Stroop tasks between dyscalculic and
      normal children did not disappear after controlling the non-executive components.
      The difference of accuracy in color-word incongruent tasks between children with 
      DD&RD and normal children reached significant levels (P<0.05). Children with
      DD-only confronted with general inhibitory deficits, while children with DD&RD
      confronted with word inhibitory deficits only.

TI  - The left occipitotemporal system in reading: disruption of focal fMRI
      connectivity to left inferior frontal and inferior parietal language areas in
      children with dyslexia.
PG  - 2426-36
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.10.002 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a severe reading disorder, which is characterized by
      dysfluent reading and impaired automaticity of visual word processing. Adults
      with dyslexia show functional deficits in several brain regions including the
      so-called "Visual Word Form Area" (VWFA), which is implicated in visual word
      processing and located within the larger left occipitotemporal VWF-System. The
      present study examines functional connections of the left occipitotemporal
      VWF-System with other major language areas in children with dyslexia. Functional 
      connectivity MRI was used to assess connectivity of the VWF-System in 18 children
      with dyslexia and 24 age-matched controls (age 9.7-12.5 years) using five
      neighboring left occipitotemporal regions of interest (ROIs) during a continuous 
      reading task requiring phonological and orthographic processing. First, the
      results revealed a focal origin of connectivity from the VWF-System, in that
      mainly the VWFA was functionally connected with typical left frontal and parietal
      language areas in control children. Adjacent posterior and anterior VWF-System
      ROIs did not show such connectivity, confirming the special role that the VWFA
      plays in word processing. Second, we detected a significant disruption of
      functional connectivity between the VWFA and left inferior frontal and left
      inferior parietal language areas in the children with dyslexia. The current
      findings add to our understanding of dyslexia by showing that functional
      disconnection of the left occipitotemporal system is limited to the small VWFA
      region crucial for automatic visual word processing, and emerges early during
      reading acquisition in children with dyslexia, along with deficits in
      orthographic and phonological processing of visual word forms.

AB  - We live in a multisensory world and one of the challenges the brain is faced with
      is deciding what information belongs together. Our ability to make assumptions
      about the relatedness of multisensory stimuli is partly based on their temporal
      and spatial relationships. Stimuli that are proximal in time and space are likely
      to be bound together by the brain and ascribed to a common external event. Using 
      this framework we can describe multisensory processes in the context of spatial
      and temporal filters or windows that compute the probability of the relatedness
      of stimuli. Whereas numerous studies have examined the characteristics of these
      multisensory filters in adults and discrepancies in window size have been
      reported between infants and adults, virtually nothing is known about
      multisensory temporal processing in childhood. To examine this, we compared the
      ability of 10 and 11 year olds and adults to detect audiovisual temporal
      asynchrony. Findings revealed striking and asymmetric age-related differences.
      Whereas children were able to identify asynchrony as readily as adults when
      visual stimuli preceded auditory cues, significant group differences were
      identified at moderately long stimulus onset asynchronies (150-350 ms) where the 
      auditory stimulus was first. Results suggest that changes in audiovisual temporal
      perception extend beyond the first decade of life. In addition to furthering our 
      understanding of basic multisensory developmental processes, these findings have 
      implications on disorders (e.g., autism, dyslexia) in which emerging evidence
      suggests alterations in multisensory temporal function.

AB  - When skilled readers read briefly-presented word pairs, they produce between-word
      errors, in which letters migrate between neighboring words (e.g., mild wind can
      be misread as wild mind). Such errors are also produced by individuals with
      attentional dyslexia, even without time limitation. In this study, we tested
      several aspects of skilled reading of word pairs in short exposure, such as
      migrations between vertically and horizontally presented pairs, error types,
      position preservation, position sensitivity, and the effect of morphology. We
      compared the results to findings from developmental attentional dyslexia. Whereas
      both populations make between-word migrations, they crucially differ in the type 
      and distribution of errors. In developmental attentional dyslexia, omission of
      identical letters that appear in the same position in the two words is prevalent,
      but it was rare in skilled reading. Other errors such as intrusions and buffer
      migrations also happened only in dyslexia but not in skilled reading. The
      different error patterns may suggest that different mechanisms underlie the
      incorrect reading in short exposure and the reading impairment in attentional
      dyslexia. Furthermore, the abundance of between-word migrations and the absence
      of letter position errors within words support that notion of two separate
      functions, one for letter-to-word binding, the other for letter position
      encoding.

TI  - Posterior fossa syndrome after posterior fossa surgery in children with brain
      tumors.
PG  - 206-10
LID - 10.1002/pbc.22730 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) is defined as the temporary and
      complete loss of speech after posterior fossa surgery. The goal of this study was
      to identify incidence and risk factors for PFS and to determine accompanying
      neurobehavioral and psychologic problems. PROCEDURE: Between May 2007 and April
      2009, children with brain tumors having posterior fossa surgery were evaluated
      neurologically and psychologically in preoperative and postoperative period.
      RESULTS: PFS developed in 9 patients among 36 (25%) included in the study. Mutism
      continued for 120 days in one patient. Histopathological diagnosis (P = 0.05),
      location of the tumor (P = 0.05) and socioeconomic level of the family (P = 0.06)
      gave the significant results in relation with the PFS by univariate analyses. In 
      multivariate analysis the risk of developing PFS was found 7.2 times higher in
      patients with medulloblastoma, 6.7 times higher in tumors located at the midline,
      5.7 times higher in families with low socioecnomic level. Intelligence quotients 
      of the patients in PFS and other group (P = 0.85) with Wechsler Intelligence
      Scale for Children and the results of the Denver II Developmental Screening Test 
      were not significant statistically (P = 0.5). CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of
      medulloblastoma, midline location of the tumor and low socioeconomic level of the
      families are important risk factors for the development of PFS. These findings
      support the hypothesis that temporary ischemia and edema due to retracted and
      manipulated dentate nuclei and superior cerebellar pedincles may be the cause of 
      mutism.

TI  - The effects of embryonic knockdown of the candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene 
      homologue Dyx1c1 on the distribution of GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex.
PG  - 535-46
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.11.002 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a language-based learning disability, and a number of
      candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes have been identified, including DYX1C1,
      KIAA0319, and DCDC2. Knockdown of function by embryonic transfection of small
      hairpin RNA (shRNA) of rat homologues of these genes dramatically disrupts
      neuronal migration to the cerebral cortex by both cell autonomous and non-cell
      autonomous effects. Here we sought to investigate the extent of non-cell
      autonomous effects following in utero disruption of the candidate dyslexia
      susceptibility gene homolog Dyx1c1 by assessing the effects of this disruption on
      GABAergic neurons. We transfected the ventricular zone of embryonic day (E) 15.5 
      rat pups with either Dyx1c1 shRNA, DYX1C1 expression construct, both Dyx1c1 shRNA
      and DYX1C1 expression construct, or a scrambled version of Dyx1c1 shRNA, and
      sacrificed them at postnatal day 21. The mothers of these rats were injected with
      BrdU at either E13.5, E15.5, or E17.5. Neurons transfected with Dyx1c1 shRNA were
      bi-modally distributed in the cerebral cortex with one population in heterotopic 
      locations at the white matter border and another migrating beyond their expected 
      location in the cerebral cortex. In contrast, there was no disruption of
      migration following transfection with the DYX1C1 expression construct. We found
      untransfected GABAergic neurons (parvalbumin, calretinin, and neuropeptide Y) in 
      the heterotopic collections of neurons in Dyx1c1 shRNA treated animals,
      supporting the hypothesis of non-cell autonomous effects. In contrast, we found
      no evidence that the position of the GABAergic neurons that made it to the
      cerebral cortex was disrupted by the embryonic transfection with any of the
      constructs. Taken together, these results support the notion that neurons within 
      heterotopias caused by transfection with Dyx1c1 shRNA result from both cell
      autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects, but there is no evidence to support
      non-cell autonomous disruption of neuronal position in the cerebral cortex
      itself.

AB  - Individuals with developmental dyslexia vary in their ability to improve reading 
      skills, but the brain basis for improvement remains largely unknown. We performed
      a prospective, longitudinal study over 2.5 y in children with dyslexia (n = 25)
      or without dyslexia (n = 20) to discover whether initial behavioral or brain
      measures, including functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can
      predict future long-term reading gains in dyslexia. No behavioral measure,
      including widely used and standardized reading and language tests, reliably
      predicted future reading gains in dyslexia. Greater right prefrontal activation
      during a reading task that demanded phonological awareness and right superior
      longitudinal fasciculus (including arcuate fasciculus) white-matter organization 
      significantly predicted future reading gains in dyslexia. Multivariate pattern
      analysis (MVPA) of these two brain measures, using linear support vector machine 
      (SVM) and cross-validation, predicted significantly above chance (72% accuracy)
      which particular child would or would not improve reading skills (behavioral
      measures were at chance). MVPA of whole-brain activation pattern during
      phonological processing predicted which children with dyslexia would improve
      reading skills 2.5 y later with >90% accuracy. These findings identify right
      prefrontal brain mechanisms that may be critical for reading improvement in
      dyslexia and that may differ from typical reading development. Brain measures
      that predict future behavioral outcomes (neuroprognosis) may be more accurate, in
      some cases, than available behavioral measures.

AB  - The authors investigated secondary conditions in people with developmental
      disabilities in terms of (a) the average number of conditions experienced and
      overall health and independence, (b) their degree and nature, and (c) gender
      differences. Information was obtained by a questionnaire completed by the
      caregivers for 659 people with developmental disabilities. Participants
      experienced an average of 11.3 secondary conditions. Secondary conditions causing
      significant limitations were reading difficulties, communication, physical
      fitness-conditioning, personal hygiene-appearance, weight, dental and oral
      hygiene, and memory problems. Some gender differences emerged in overall health
      scores and limitations due to secondary conditions.

AB  - Continued progress in language and learning disabilities (LDs) research requires 
      a renewed focused on issues of etiology. Genetics research forms a central tenet 
      of such an agenda and is critical in clarifying relationships among oral language
      development, acquisition of literacy and mathematics, executive function skills, 
      and comorbid conditions. For progress to be made, diversified efforts must
      continue to emphasize molecular and behavioral genetics (including quantitative
      genetics) approaches, in concert with multi-disciplinary and multi-modal
      projects, to provide an integrated understanding of the behavioral and biological
      manifestations of language and learning disabilities. Critically, increased
      efforts to include ethnic, socio-economic, and linguistically diverse participant
      samples across a range of developmental stages is required to meet the public
      health needs of learners in the US and across the world. Taken together, this
      body of work will continue to enhance our understanding of LDs and help us move
      toward a truly prevention based approach to language and learning disabilities.

AB  - Four genes, DYX1C1, ROBO1, DCDC2 and KIAA0319 have been studied both genetically 
      and functionally as candidate genes for developmental dyslexia, a common learning
      disability in children. The identification of novel genes is crucial to better
      understand the molecular pathways affected in dyslectic individuals. Here, we
      report results from a fine-mapping approach involving linkage and association
      analysis in Finnish and German dyslexic cohorts. We restrict a candidate region
      to 0.3 Mb on chromosome 7q33. This region harbours the gene diacylglycerol
      kinase, iota (DGKI) which contains overlapping haplotypes associated with
      dyslexia in both Finnish and German sample sets.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a complex neuro-genetic disorder associated with
      difficulty in learning to read despite adequate intelligence and educational
      opportunities. Studies in different populations have established associations
      between DD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of candidate
      genes, including DYX1C1, KIAA0319 and DCDC2. In an ongoing DD study in India, we 
      screened twenty SNPs located within the coding region of these three candidate
      genes by mass-ARRAY technique. At this point, there is no statistical evidence of
      association between the allelic variation in the three candidate genes and DD in 
      our sample, although there might be some promising leads for future research that
      should involve a large and a better characterized sample.

      in nuclear families of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 67-76
LID - 10.1007/s10519-010-9412-7 [doi]
AB  - Converging evidence indicates that developmental problems in oral language and
      mathematics can predate or co-occur with developmental dyslexia (DD). Substantial
      genetic correlations have been found between language, mathematics and reading
      traits, independent of the method of sampling. We tested for association of
      variants of two DD susceptibility genes, DCDC2 and DYX1C1, in nuclear families
      ascertained through a proband with DD using concurrent measurements of language
      and mathematics in both probands and siblings by the Quantitative Transmission
      Disequilibrium Test. Evidence for significant associations was found between
      DCDC2 and 'Numerical Facts' (p value = 0.02, with 85 informative families,
      genetic effect = 0.57) and between 'Mental Calculation' and DYX1C1 markers -3GA
      (p value = 0.05, with 40 informative families, genetic effect = -0.67) and 1249GT
      (p value = 0.02, with 49 informative families, genetic effect = -0.65). No
      statistically significant associations were found between DCDC2 or DYX1C1 and
      language phenotypes. Both DCDC2 and DYX1C1 DD susceptibility genes appear to have
      a pleiotropic role on mathematics but not language phenotypes.

TI  - Genetic variance in a component of the language acquisition device: ROBO1
      polymorphisms associated with phonological buffer deficits.
PG  - 50-7
LID - 10.1007/s10519-010-9402-9 [doi]
AB  - The region containing ROBO1 (Chromosome 3p12.3) has been implicated as a
      susceptibility gene for reading disorder and language deficit by translocation
      and linkage data. No association studies have yet been reported supporting any
      candidate gene. Here we report the first association of this gene with language
      deficits, specifically with phonological buffer deficits (a phenotype implicated 
      in language acquisition, Specific Language Impairment and Speech Sound Disorder) 
      and dyslexia (reading and spelling ability traits) in an unselected sample of
      adolescent twins and their siblings. Family-based analyses were performed on 144 
      tag SNPs in ROBO1, typed in 538 families with up to five offspring and tested for
      association with a developmental marker of language impairment (phonological
      buffer capacity, assessed using non word repetition). A reading and spelling
      ability measure--based on validated measures of lexical processing (irregular
      word) and grapheme-phoneme decoding (pseudo word)--and measures of short-term and
      working memory were also analysed. Significant association for phonological
      buffer capacity was observed for 21 of 144 SNPs tested, peaking at 8.70 x 10(-05)
      and 9.30 x 10(-05) for SNPs rs6803202 and rs4535189 respectively for nonword
      repetition, values that survive correction for multiple testing. Twenty-two SNPs 
      showed significant associations for verbal storage (forward digit span)--a trait 
      linked to phonological span. By contrast, just 5 SNPs reached nominal
      significance for working-memory, not surviving correction, and, importantly, only
      one SNP in the 144 tested reached nominal significance (0.04) for association
      with reading and spelling ability. These results provide strong support for ROBO1
      as a gene involved in a core trait underpinning language acquisition, with a
      specific function in supporting a short-term buffer for arbitrary phonological
      strings. These effects of ROBO1 appear to be unrelated to brain mechanisms
      underpinning reading ability, at least by adolescence. While replication will be 
      critical, the present results strongly support ROBO1 as the first gene discovered
      to be associated with language deficits affecting normal variation in language
      ability. Its functional role in neuronal migration underlying bilateral symmetry 
      and lateralization of neuronal function further suggests a role in the evolution 
      of human language ability.

PG  - 43-9
LID - 10.1007/s10519-010-9395-4 [doi]
AB  - There is a compelling body of evidence that developmental dyslexia runs in
      families and seems to be highly inheritable. Several investigations during the
      last two decades have shown possible locations of genes that might be involved in
      dyslexia, including regions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 15 and 18. In
      addition, six candidate genes (KIAA0319, DYX1C1, DCDC2, ROBO1, MRPL19 and C2ORF3)
      seem to be related to dyslexia. The present study carried out a whole genome scan
      in a six-generation pedigree. In addition to literacy skills the assessment
      included cognitive skills and records concerning the history of reading and
      writing ability. Thirty-five percent were regarded as dyslexic in the family. A
      linkage analysis using both a quantitative and a qualitative approach has been
      performed. No evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that the
      transmission of dyslexia in this pedigree is due to a highly penetrant major
      gene, and previous linkage findings were not replicated; however, power in this
      small study was not adequate to confirm linkage of genes with small to moderate
      effects. The results were discussed in relation to diagnostic procedures and
      sample characteristics.

PG  - 52-61
LID - 10.1016/j.braindev.2009.12.008 [doi]
AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most frequent monogenetic disorder
      encountered in children. Approximately 50% of children with NF1 develop learning 
      disabilities notably for reading. Understanding the reasons of reading impairment
      in this context may lead to improve therapeutic methods in NF1 and more generally
      in reading developmental disorders. An interesting challenge is to disentangle
      the connections between the different levels of description proposed in the
      etiological approach. This is the aim of this review based on recent advances in 
      analysis of cognitive deficits observed in children with NF1 and on results of
      recent brain imaging (structural and functional) or animal model studies.

AB  - To identify the putative interacting partners for Kiaa0319-like protein.
      KIAA0319-like, located near the dyslexia susceptibility locus, DYX8 in chromosome
      1p34.3, has been suggested as a positional candidate for developmental dyslexia
      due to its homology with another gene, KIAA0319 which has been strongly
      established as a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia. Previous research has
      shown that a single marker, rs7523017 (P = 0.042) has been associated with
      developmental dyslexia by a Canadian group. There is little functional
      information about this gene and protein. In this article, we put forward further 
      evidence that support Kiaa0319-like is a candidate for this disorder. A
      yeast-2-hybrid screen and co-immunopreciptiation assays were performed to find
      protein interacting partners of KIAA0319L. A human cortex immunohistochemistry
      assay was performed to show the colocalization of Kiaa0319-like and its specific 
      interacting partner in cells. Nogo Receptor 1 (NgR1), an axon guidance receptor, 
      was identified to have physical interactions with Kiaa0319-like protein. These
      two proteins interact predominantly in the cytoplasmic granules of cortical
      neurons in the human brain cortex. Based on this data, it can be concluded that
      Kiaa0319-like protein interacts with Nogo Receptor 1, supporting the idea that
      Kiaa0319-like protein participates in axon guidance.

AB  - We tested the influence of list context on word frequency and length effects on
      the reading aloud of Italian developmental dyslexics and skilled peers. The
      stimuli were presented either in mixed blocks (alternating words and nonwords) or
      in pure blocks. The analyses based on the rate-and-amount model ( Faust et al.,
      1999 ) indicated that group differences in reaction times between dyslexic and
      skilled readers (a) were well accounted for in terms of global components and (b)
      were modulated by context in the case of words but not in the case of nonwords.
      ANOVAs on z-transformed reaction time data further indicated the influence of
      stimulus length. Importantly, the frequency effect interacted with context:
      Controls showed a list context effect for high- and low-frequency words, while
      dyslexics showed a list context effect only for high-frequency words. The effect 
      of length on reading times remained unaffected by context manipulation. It is
      proposed that this pattern of results may be accounted for by hypothesizing two
      separate deficits: An early graphemic impairment affecting performance
      independently of context and a later inefficiency in activating entries in the
      orthographic lexicon as a function of context demands.

AB  - Although reduced verbal span is well documented in individuals with developmental

      the present study was to ascertain whether the working memory deficit in
      developmental dyslexia is confined to verbal material or whether it also involves
      visual-object and visual-spatial information. Results document deficits on span
      tasks tapping verbal, visual-spatial, and visual-object working memory in
      dyslexic children and indicate that the working memory deficit in developmental
      dyslexia is not limited to dysfunction of phonological components but also
      involves visual-object and visual-spatial information.

TI  - Rise time and formant transition duration in the discrimination of speech sounds:
      the Ba-Wa distinction in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 34-43
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00955.x [doi]
AB  - Across languages, children with developmental dyslexia have a specific difficulty
      with the neural representation of the sound structure (phonological structure) of
      speech. One likely cause of their difficulties with phonology is a perceptual
      difficulty in auditory temporal processing (Tallal, 1980). Tallal (1980) proposed
      that basic auditory processing of brief, rapidly successive acoustic changes is
      compromised in dyslexia, thereby affecting phonetic discrimination (e.g.
      discriminating /b/ from /d/) via impaired discrimination of formant transitions
      (rapid acoustic changes in frequency and intensity). However, an alternative
      auditory temporal hypothesis is that the basic auditory processing of the slower 
      amplitude modulation cues in speech is compromised (Goswami et al., 2002). Here, 
      we contrast children's perception of a synthetic speech contrast (ba/wa) when it 
      is based on the speed of the rate of change of frequency information (formant
      transition duration) versus the speed of the rate of change of amplitude
      modulation (rise time). We show that children with dyslexia have excellent
      phonetic discrimination based on formant transition duration, but poor phonetic
      discrimination based on envelope cues. The results explain why phonetic
      discrimination may be allophonic in developmental dyslexia (Serniclaes et al.,
      2004), and suggest new avenues for the remediation of developmental dyslexia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and types of substance use disorders (SUDs) in
      adults diagnosed during childhood as having a developmental language disorder
      (DLD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prevalence rates and types of SUDs in a clinical
      sample of 469 individuals diagnosed during childhood as having a DLD were
      compared with SUDs in 2,345 matched controls from the general population without 
      a known history of DLD using data from the nationwide Danish Psychiatric Central 
      Register (DPCR). The average observation time was 34.7 years, and the mean age at
      follow-up was 35.8 years. RESULTS: Of the 469 individuals with DLD, 12 (2.6%)
      appeared in the DPCR with an SUD diagnosis, compared with 46 (2.0%) in the
      control group (p = 0.41; OR 1.3; 95% CI 0.7-2.5). Specific SUDs occurred with a
      low frequency in both groups. Only cocaine-related disorders were significantly
      associated with DLD (p = 0.03). Variables at assessment in childhood, i.e.
      gender, IQ, the presence of a receptive language disorder, and the degrees of
      receptive and expressive language disorders were not associated with an SUD
      diagnosis in the DPCR at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support the
      hypothesis that DLD is a risk factor for SUD in adulthood.

AB  - Studies on developmental dyscalculia (DD) have tried to identify a basic
      numerical deficit that could account for this specific learning disability. The
      first proposition was that the number magnitude representation of these children 
      was impaired. However, Rousselle and Noel (2007) brought data showing that this
      was not the case but rather that these children were impaired when processing the
      magnitude of symbolic numbers only. Since then, incongruent results have been
      published. In this paper, we will propose a developmental perspective on this
      issue. We will argue that the first deficit shown in DD regards the building of
      an exact representation of numerical value, thanks to the learning of symbolic
      numbers, and that the reduced acuity of the approximate number magnitude system
      appears only later and is secondary to the first deficit.

AB  - Event-related potential (ERP) studies of word recognition have provided
      fundamental insights into the time-course and stages of visual and auditory word 
      form processing in reading. Here, we used ERPs to track the time-course of
      phonological processing in dyslexic adults and matched controls. Participants
      engaged in semantic judgments of visually presented high-cloze probability
      sentences ending either with (a) their best completion word, (b) a homophone of
      the best completion, (c) a pseudohomophone of the best completion, or (d) an
      unrelated word, to examine the interplay of phonological and orthographic
      processing in reading and the stage(s) of processing affected in developmental
      dyslexia. Early ERP peaks (N1, P2, N2) were modulated in amplitude similarly in
      the two groups of participants. However, dyslexic readers failed to show the P3a 
      modulation seen in control participants for unexpected homophones and
      pseudohomophones (i.e., sentence completions that are acceptable phonologically
      but are misspelt). Furthermore, P3a amplitudes significantly correlated with
      reaction times in each experimental condition. Our results showed no sign of a
      deficit in accessing phonological representations during reading, since sentence 
      primes yielded phonological priming effects that did not differ between
      participant groups in the early phases of processing. On the other hand, we
      report new evidence for a deficient attentional engagement with orthographically 
      unexpected but phonologically expected words in dyslexia, irrespective of task
      focus on orthography or phonology. In our view, this result is consistent with
      deficiency in reading occurring from the point at which attention is oriented to 
      phonological analysis, which may underlie broader difficulties in sublexical
      decoding.

AB  - Language and music are complex cognitive and neural functions that rely on
      awareness of one's own sound productions. Information on the awareness of vocal
      pitch, and its relation to phonemic awareness which is crucial for learning to
      read, will be important for understanding the relationship between tone-deafness 
      and developmental language disorders such as dyslexia. Here we show that phonemic
      awareness skills are positively correlated with pitch perception-production
      skills in children. Children between the ages of seven and nine were tested on
      pitch perception and production, phonemic awareness, and IQ. Results showed a
      significant positive correlation between pitch perception-production and phonemic
      awareness, suggesting that the relationship between musical and linguistic sound 
      processing is intimately linked to awareness at the level of pitch and phonemes. 
      Since tone-deafness is a pitch-related impairment and dyslexia is a deficit of
      phonemic awareness, we suggest that dyslexia and tone-deafness may have a shared 
      and/or common neural basis.

TI  - Evolutionary diversification of DYX1C1 transcripts via an HERV-H LTR integration 
      event.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - DYX1C1 is a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia and has three alternative
      pre-mRNA spliced forms in the human genome. One of the transcripts contains an
      HERV-H LTR that could affect the expression level of DYX1C1. We speculate that
      the HERV-H LTR integrated into the DYX1C1 locus in the catarrhine lineage after
      its divergence from the platyrrhine lineage. Reverse transcription-PCR of the
      HERV-H LTR-related transcript produced four alternative forms from several human 
      tissues. All of alternative forms were also identified in various rhesus macaque 
      tissues. Through sequencing analysis of various primate DNA samples, we found
      that a part of the HERV-H LTR sequence was duplicated within the DYX1C1 exon 9
      only in catarrhines. However, the duplication event did not cause frameshift
      mutation of the DYX1C1 transcript. Taken together, this HERV-H LTR insertion into
      DYX1C1 has contributed to transcript diversification of DYX1C1 during primate
      evolution.

LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02310.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two developmental reading disorders, dyslexia and reading
      comprehension impairment, are identified by different behavioural characteristics
      and traced back to different underlying cognitive impairments. Thus, reading
      interventions designed to address each of these reading disorders differ in
      content. METHOD: This review summarises the nature of dyslexia and reading
      comprehension impairment, and current understanding of best practice in
      associated reading interventions. CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence for the
      effectiveness of phonological-based reading interventions in supporting children 
      with dyslexic difficulties, and a growing understanding of how to meet the needs 
      of children with reading comprehension impairment, with vocabulary instruction
      offering a promising approach. Although the content of interventions must be
      tailored to an individual's reader profile, general principles regarding the
      implementation and evaluation of intervention programmes can be extracted.

AB  - PURPOSE: To elaborate a procedure of metaphonological evaluation, and to
      characterize the performance of students with developmental dyslexia, learning
      disabilities and learning difficulties and good readers in this evaluation.
      METHODS: Metaphonological abilities tests were elaborated based on the necessary 
      skills for reading and writing development. Participants were 134 students from
      3rd to 5th grades of elementary school of both genders, with ages between 7 and
      13 years, divided into GI (20 students with developmental dyslexia), GII (20
      students with learning disabilities), GIII (20 students with learning
      difficulties) and GIV (74 good readers). The assessment of metaphonological
      abilities - PROHFON - was applied. RESULTS: Students from GI and GII differed
      from GIV in most of the tests; GI differed from GII only in the phonemic
      synthesis and analysis test, and from GIII in abilities of deletion and
      combination of phonemes. GIII differed from GIV in counting, identification,
      rhyming, deletion, and combination abilities. CONCLUSION: Students with
      developmental dyslexia, learning disabilities and learning difficulties, and good
      readers showed similar performances in identification, counting and combining
      phonemes, rhyme and alliteration abilities. The groups differed from each other
      regarding syllabic (counting, identification, synthesis and analysis, deletion,
      combination) and phonemic (deletion, synthesis and analysis) abilities. The
      PROHFON contributed to characterize the metaphonological profile of students with
      different learning deficits.

PG  - e27105
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0027105 [doi]
AB  - Children with developmental dyslexia show reading impairment compared to their
      peers, despite being matched on IQ, socio-economic background, and educational
      opportunities. The neurological and cognitive basis of dyslexia remains a highly 
      debated topic. Proponents of the magnocellular theory, which postulates
      abnormalities in the M-stream of the visual pathway cause developmental dyslexia,
      claim that children with dyslexia have deficient binocular coordination, and this
      is the underlying cause of developmental dyslexia. We measured binocular
      coordination during reading and a non-linguistic scanning task in three
      participant groups: adults, typically developing children, and children with
      dyslexia. A significant increase in fixation disparity was observed for dyslexic 
      children solely when reading. Our study casts serious doubts on the claims of the
      magnocellular theory. The exclusivity of increased fixation disparity in
      dyslexics during reading might be a result of the allocation of inadequate
      attentional and/or cognitive resources to the reading process, or suboptimal
      linguistic processing per se.

TI  - Perceptual anchoring in preschool children: not adultlike, but there.
PG  - e19769
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0019769 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that human auditory perception follows a
      prolonged developmental trajectory, sometimes continuing well into adolescence.
      Whereas both sensory and cognitive accounts have been proposed, the development
      of the ability to base current perceptual decisions on prior information, an
      ability that strongly benefits adult perception, has not been directly explored. 
      Here we ask whether the auditory frequency discrimination of preschool children
      also improves when given the opportunity to use previously presented standard
      stimuli as perceptual anchors, and whether the magnitude of this anchoring effect
      undergoes developmental changes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Frequency
      discrimination was tested using two adaptive same/different protocols. In one
      protocol (with-reference), a repeated 1-kHz standard tone was presented
      repeatedly across trials. In the other (no-reference), no such repetitions
      occurred. Verbal memory and early reading skills were also evaluated to determine
      if the pattern of correlations between frequency discrimination, memory and
      literacy is similar to that previously reported in older children and adults.
      Preschool children were significantly more sensitive in the with-reference than
      in the no-reference condition, but the magnitude of this anchoring effect was
      smaller than that observed in adults. The pattern of correlations among
      discrimination thresholds, memory and literacy replicated previous reports in
      older children. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The processes allowing the use of
      context to form perceptual anchors are already functional among preschool
      children, albeit to a lesser extent than in adults. Nevertheless, immature
      anchoring cannot fully account for the poorer frequency discrimination abilities 
      of young children. That anchoring is present among the majority of typically
      developing preschool children suggests that the anchoring deficits observed among
      individuals with dyslexia represent a true deficit rather than a developmental
      delay.

      performance for professionals in both health and education areas. It discusses
      current aspects of education, learning and the main conditions involved in
      underachievement. It also presents updated data on key aspects of neurobiology,
      epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, comorbidities and diagnosis, early
      intervention and treatment of the major pathologies comprised. It is a
      comprehensive, non-systematic literature review on learning, school performance, 
      learning disorders (dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia), attention deficit /
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Poor
      school performance is a frequent problem faced by our children, causing serious
      emotional, social and economic issues. An updated view of the subject facilitates
      clinical reasoning, accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

LID - 10.1016/j.tics.2010.10.001 [doi]
AB  - Neural coding by brain oscillations is a major focus in neuroscience, with
      important implications for dyslexia research. Here, I argue that an oscillatory
      'temporal sampling' framework enables diverse data from developmental dyslexia to
      be drawn into an integrated theoretical framework. The core deficit in dyslexia
      is phonological. Temporal sampling of speech by neuroelectric oscillations that
      encode incoming information at different frequencies could explain the perceptual
      and phonological difficulties with syllables, rhymes and phonemes found in
      individuals with dyslexia. A conceptual framework based on oscillations that
      entrain to sensory input also has implications for other sensory theories of
      dyslexia, offering opportunities for integrating a diverse and confusing
      experimental literature.

TI  - Is season of birth related to developmental dyslexia?
PG  - 175-82
LID - 10.1007/s11881-010-0037-6 [doi]
AB  - Different moderators/mediators of risk are involved in developmental dyslexia
      (DD), but data are inconsistent. We explored the prevalence of season of birth
      and its association with gender and age of school entry in an Italian sample of
      dyslexic children compared to an Italian normal control group. The clinical
      sample included 498 children (345 boys, mean age 10.3 +/- 2.1 years) with DD, the
      control sample 1,276 children (658 boys, mean age 10.8 +/- 2.2 years) from four
      elementary schools from the same urban area, and with the same socio-economic
      status level. A prevalence of birth in autumn was found among children with DD
      compared to controls (34% versus 24%, p < 0.0001). Children with DD were more
      frequently males (p < 0.0001) and had a lower mean age of school entry (p <
      0.0001). Regarding the distribution of ages, 11.4% of children with DD, but none 
      of the subjects in the control group, started school before 5.7 years. Therefore,
      greater risk of DD was related to age of school entry (OR = 2.72), gender (OR =
      2.16), and season of birth (OR = 1.21). Significant interactions between boys
      with DD born in autumn, and correct school of entry (OR = 2.56) were joint
      predictors of higher risk of DD. The association between birth in autumn and DD
      may be explained by the earlier age of school entry, which may be a critical
      element in the youngest children with DD or at risk to DD. Whether Italian school
      policy is oriented to anticipate the school entry, a closer detection of early
      learning disorders and associated risk factors (familial load, specific language 
      disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) should be warranted.

AB  - With the present review, we intend to highlight the importance of considering the
      age- and development-dependent occurrence of comorbidity in ADHD and to outline
      distinct trajectories of symptom progression with possible impact on course and
      outcome of ADHD. The review will focus on introducing the concepts of
      "developmental epidemiology" and "developmental comorbidity". Psychiatric and
      non-psychiatric age-dependent comorbidity can be seen in the majority of
      children, adolescents and adults with ADHD, resulting in a severe impairment of
      everyday life with considerable functional and psychosocial problems. Concerning 
      the temporal order of occurrence, psychiatric conditions may be present before
      the appearance of first definite ADHD symptoms ("pre-comorbidity", such as
      temperament factors, sleep disturbance, autism spectrum disorders and atopic
      eczema). They may coincide with the time when ADHD symptoms reach a clinically
      significant level ("simultaneous comorbidity": enuresis, encopresis,
      developmental dyslexia). The majority of comorbidity, however, appears after the 
      onset of ADHD in the course of disease ("post-comorbidity": tic disorder,
      depression and suicidality, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,
      bipolar disorder, conduct and substance use disorders, obesity and personality
      disorders). The aetio-pathophysiology of ADHD and its comorbid disorders and also
      the nature of comorbidity itself being highly heterogeneous, we additionally
      discuss possible models of comorbidity. In the future, longitudinal data on
      distinct patterns of symptom and comorbidity progression would help to refine
      disease classification systems, strengthen the power of future genetic studies
      and finally allow for more specific treatment strategies.

PG  - 617-27
LID - 10.1097/WCO.0b013e32834027f6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Analysis of the auditory environment, source identification
      and vocal communication all require efficient brain mechanisms for
      disambiguating, representing and understanding complex natural sounds as
      'auditory objects'. Failure of these mechanisms leads to a diverse spectrum of
      clinical deficits. Here we review current evidence concerning the phenomenology, 
      mechanisms and brain substrates of auditory agnosias and related disorders of
      auditory object processing. RECENT FINDINGS: Analysis of lesions causing auditory
      object deficits has revealed certain broad anatomical correlations: deficient
      parsing of the auditory scene is associated with lesions involving the
      parieto-temporal junction, while selective disorders of sound recognition occur
      with more anterior temporal lobe or extra-temporal damage. Distributed neural
      networks have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of such disorders 
      as developmental dyslexia, congenital amusia and tinnitus. Auditory category
      deficits may arise from defective interaction of spectrotemporal encoding and
      executive and mnestic processes. Dedicated brain mechanisms are likely to process
      specialized sound objects such as voices and melodies. SUMMARY: Emerging
      empirical evidence suggests a clinically relevant, hierarchical and modular
      neuropsychological model of auditory object processing that provides a framework 
      for understanding auditory agnosias and makes specific predictions to direct
      future work.

AB  - AIM: to improve understanding of brain function in children with severe dyslexia 
      in terms of minor neurological dysfunctions (MNDs). METHOD: one hundred and four 
      children (81 males, 23 females; age range 7-12y; mean age 9y 7mo, SD 1y 2mo;)
      with severe dyslexia (the presence of a Full-scale IQ score of >/= 85,
      retardation in single-word or text reading of >/=2y), assessed in a department of
      dyslexia of a third-level regional psychiatric centre, underwent a neurological
      examination according to Touwen and a multidisciplinary child psychiatric
      assessment. Special attention was paid to severity and type of MND. Data were
      compared with neurological morbidity data of children in the general population. 
      RESULTS: most children had MND (87%): 43% had simple MND, 44% complex MND. The
      incidence of MND was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the children with dyslexia
      than in the general population (simple MND 15%, complex MND 6%). Children with
      dyslexia showed especially fine manipulative disability and - to a lesser extent 
      - mild dysfunction in muscle tone regulation and excessive presence of associated
      movements. A comorbid psychiatric syndrome was diagnosed in 66 children (63%):
      emotional disturbances (27%), adjustment disorder (42%), hyperkinetic disorder
      (15%), autism spectrum disorder (3%), specific disturbances of childhood not
      otherwise specified (13%). The neurological findings of children with dyslexia
      with and without psychiatric comorbidity were similar. INTERPRETATION: our
      results demonstrate the importance of neurological and child psychiatric
      assessment in children with severe dyslexia. Our findings suggest that
      dysfunction of cortical structures plays a dominant role in dyslexia.

AB  - Initial lexical activation in typical populations is a direct reflection of the
      goodness of fit between the presented stimulus and the intended target. In this
      study, lexical activation was investigated upon presentation of polysyllabic
      pseudowords (such as procodile for crocodile) for the atypical population of
      dyslexic adults to see to what extent mismatching phonemic information affects
      lexical activation in the face of overwhelming support for one specific lexical
      candidate. Results of an auditory lexical decision task showed that sensitivity
      to phonemic mismatch was less in the dyslexic population, compared to the
      respective control group. However, the dyslexic participants were outperformed by
      their controls only for word-initial mismatches. It is argued that a subtle
      speech decoding deficit affects lexical activation levels and makes spoken word
      processing less robust against distortion.

      dyslexic and normally reading children.
PG  - 1346-58
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.009 [doi]
AB  - Recent theories of developmental dyslexia explain reading deficits in terms of
      deficient phonological awareness, attention, visual and auditory processing, or
      automaticity. Since dyslexia has a neurobiological basis, the question arises how
      the reader's proficiency in these cognitive variables affects the brain regions
      involved in visual word recognition. This question was addressed in two fMRI
      experiments with 19 normally reading children (Experiment 1) and 19 children with
      dyslexia (Experiment 2). First, reading-specific brain activation was assessed by
      contrasting the BOLD signal for reading aloud words vs. overtly naming pictures
      of real objects. Next, ANCOVAs with brain activation during reading the
      individuals' scores for all five cognitive variables assessed outside the scanner
      as covariates were performed. Whereas the normal readers' brain activation during
      reading showed co-variation effects predominantly in the right hemisphere, the
      reverse pattern was observed for the dyslexics. In particular, middle frontal
      gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, and precuneus showed contralateral effects for
      controls as compared to dyslexics. In line with earlier findings in the
      literature, these data hint at a global change in hemispheric asymmetry during
      cognitive processing in dyslexic readers, which, in turn, might affect reading
      proficiency.

PG  - 3973-81
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.10.018 [doi]
AB  - The triple-code model, cognitive neuroimaging and developmental behavioral data
      suggest a specific association between phonological processing and arithmetic
      fact retrieval. Accordingly, individuals with deficits in phonological
      processing, such as individuals with developmental dyslexia, are expected to show
      difficulties in arithmetic fact retrieval. The present study tested this proposal
      in 25 adults with developmental dyslexia and 25 matched controls by examining
      strategy use during single-digit multiplication and subtraction and its
      associations with phonological processing. Findings revealed that individuals
      with dyslexia retrieved fewer arithmetic facts from memory and were less
      efficient in doing so. At the same time, they showed deficits in phonological
      processing. Phonological processing, particularly phonological awareness, was
      related to arithmetic fact retrieval. This association was especially prominent
      in multiplication, indicating that fact retrieval in multiplication rather than
      subtraction is mediated by phonological processes. These data provide ground for 
      future neuroimaging studies, who should examine the neural overlap between
      phonological processing and multiplication fact retrieval in the same sample of
      participants.

TI  - Behavioral and ERP evidence for amodal sluggish attentional shifting in
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 4125-35
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.09.027 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the claim that amodal deficits in
      attentional shifting may be the source of reading acquisition disorders in
      phonological developmental dyslexia (sluggish attentional shifting, SAS, theory, 
      Hari & Renvall, 2001). We investigated automatic attentional shifting in the
      auditory and visual modalities in 13 dyslexic young adults with a phonological
      awareness deficit and 13 control participants, matched for cognitive abilities,
      using both behavioral and ERP measures. We tested automatic attentional shifting 
      using a stream segregation task (perception of rapid succession of visual and
      auditory stimuli as one or two streams). Results of Experiment 1(behavioral)
      suggested that in order to process two successive stimuli separately dyslexic
      participants required a significantly longer inter-stimulus interval than
      controls regardless of sensory modality. In Experiment 2 (ERPs), the same
      participants were tested by means of an auditory and a visual oddball tasks
      involving variations in the tempo of the same alternating stimuli as Experiment
      1. P3b amplitudes elicited by deviant tempos were differently modulated between
      groups, supporting predictions made on the basis of observations in Experiment 1.
      Overall, these results support the hypothesis that SAS in dyslexic participants
      might be responsible for their atypical perception of rapid sequential stimulus
      sequences in both the auditory and the visual modalities. Furthermore, these
      results bring new evidence supporting the link between amodal SAS and the
      phonological impairment in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Which neurodevelopmental disorders get researched and why?
PG  - e15112
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0015112 [doi]
AB  - AIM: There are substantial differences in the amount of research concerned with
      different disorders. This paper considers why. METHODS: Bibliographic searches
      were conducted to identify publications (1985-2009) concerned with 35
      neurodevelopmental disorders: Developmental dyslexia, Developmental dyscalculia, 
      Developmental coordination disorder, Speech sound disorder, Specific language
      impairment, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Autistic spectrum disorder,
      Tourette syndrome, Intellectual disability, Angelman syndrome, Cerebral palsy,
      Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome, Down syndrome, Duchenne
      muscular dystrophy, Fetal alcohol syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Galactosaemia,
      Klinefelter syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Lowe syndrome, Marfan syndrome,
      Neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Phenylketonuria, Prader-Willi
      syndrome, Rett syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Trisomy 18, Tuberous
      sclerosis, Turner syndrome, Velocardiofacial syndrome, Williams syndrome, XXX and
      XYY. A publication index reflecting N publications relative to prevalence was
      derived. RESULTS: The publication index was higher for rare than common
      conditions. However, this was partly explained by the tendency for rare disorders
      to be more severe. INTERPRETATION: Although research activity is predictable from
      severity and prevalence, there are exceptions. Low rates of research, and
      relatively low levels of NIH funding, characterise conditions that are the domain
      of a single discipline with limited research resources. Growth in research is not
      explained by severity, and was exceptionally steep for autism and ADHD.

TI  - Cortical reorganization in dyslexic children after phonological training:
      evidence from early evoked potentials.
PG  - 3385-95
LID - 10.1093/brain/awq199 [doi]
AB  - Brain plasticity was investigated in 14 Italian children affected by
      developmental dyslexia after 6 months of phonological training. The means used to
      measure language reorganization was the recognition potential, an early wave,
      also called N150, elicited by automatic word recognition. This component peaks
      over the left temporo-occipital cortex and its amplitude depends on linguistic
      expertise. N150 elicited by written words was measured both in dyslexic children 
      before and after training and in a sample of matched normal readers during
      phonological, semantic and orthographic tasks. After training, dyslexic children 
      increased their reading speed. Normal readers showed a typical left posterior
      N150, whereas in dyslexic children it was equally distributed across hemispheres 
      before and shifted to left posterior sites after training. In addition,
      dyslexics' left posterior N150 asymmetry on the phonological task after training 
      was significantly correlated with reading speed improvement, that is, those
      children who showed the greatest left shift in phonological N150 also had the
      greatest reading speed improvement. Source localization of the N150 component was
      made with both the Standard Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography software
      and the classical dipole analysis method termed Brain Electrical Source Analysis.
      The N150 generator lies in the left occipito-temporal cortex (Brodmann areas 39, 
      37 and 19) in good readers, but in right homologous areas in dyslexic children
      before training. After the treatment, the dyslexics' main N150 generator shifted 
      to the left occipito-inferotemporal cortex (namely Brodmann areas 37 and 19) with
      small differences between tasks. The two source location methods provided
      consistent, converging solutions. Results add to the current literature on the
      phonological hypothesis of dyslexia by showing hemispheric reorganization of
      linguistic networks at the level of early word recognition potential.
      Furthermore, the present work is the first to investigate brain reorganization in
      a regular/transparent language like Italian.

TI  - Seizures and EEG pattern in Kabuki syndrome.
PG  - 829-34
LID - 10.1016/j.braindev.2009.12.006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare dysmorphogenic disorder that is
      characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities with central nervous system
      involvement. The diagnosis is clinical and a variable degree of mental
      retardation is always present. Epilepsy is frequently reported, but a typical
      electroclinical pattern has not been described. We describe the electroclinical
      features of eight KS non-Japanese patients with epilepsy. METHODS: We analysed
      seizure characteristics and pattern EEG and clinical outcomes in eight KS
      patients. RESULTS: All patients presented with focal seizures. A frontal
      epileptic status was present in two cases. We highlighted the fact that, during
      evolution, seven patients shared the same interictal EEG pattern, which was
      characterized by isolated or repetitive biphasic spikes or sharp waves, followed 
      by a slow wave of medium and high voltage, predominantly localised in the
      fronto-central regions. The natural course of seizures is favourable.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a peculiar homogeneous electroclinical pattern in
      KS, characterized by focal seizures more frequently origin in fronto-central area
      which demonstrated that seizures are mostly focal in type and that a
      fronto-central origin is more frequently evident.

TI  - Surface area accounts for the relation of gray matter volume to reading-related
      skills and history of dyslexia.
PG  - 2625-35
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhq010 [doi]
AB  - It is unknown whether the abnormalities in brain structure and function observed 
      in dyslexic readers are congenital or arise later in development. Analyzing the 2
      components of gray matter volume separately may help in differentiating these
      possibilities. Gray matter volume is the product of cortical surface area,
      determined during prenatal brain development, and cortical thickness, determined 
      during postnatal development. For this study, 16 adults with a history of
      phonological dyslexia and 16 age- and gender-matched controls underwent magnetic 
      resonance imaging and an extensive battery of tests of reading-related skills.
      Cortical surface area and gray matter volume measures of the whole brain, the
      inferior frontal gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus were similarly related to
      phonological skills and a history of dyslexia. There was no relationship between 
      cortical thickness and phonological skills or history of dyslexia. Because
      cortical surface area reflects cortical folding patterns determined prenatally,
      this suggests that brain differences in dyslexia are rooted in early cortical
      development and are not due to compensatory changes that occur during postnatal
      development and would be expected to influence cortical thickness. This study
      demonstrates the importance of examining the separate components of gray matter
      volume when studying developmental abnormalities.

TI  - Developmental attentional dyslexia.
PG  - 1216-37
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.06.012 [doi]
AB  - Attentional dyslexia is a reading deficit in which letters migrate between
      neighboring words, but are correctly identified and keep their correct relative
      position within the word. Thus, for example, fig tree can be read as fig free or 
      even tie free. This study reports on 10 Hebrew-speaking individuals with
      developmental attentional dyslexia and explores in detail the characteristics of 
      their between-word errors. Each participant read 2290 words, presented in word
      pairs: 845 horizontally presented word pairs, 240 vertically presented word
      pairs, and 60 nonword pairs. The main results are that almost all migrations
      preserve the relative position of the migrating letter within the word,
      indicating that the between-word position can be impaired while the within-word
      position encoding remains intact. This result is also supported by the finding
      that the participants did not make many letter position errors within words.
      Further analyses indicated that more errors occur in longer words, that most
      migrations occur in final letters (which are the leftmost letters in Hebrew), and
      that letters migrate both horizontally and vertically, and more frequently from
      the first to the second word in horizontal presentation. More migrations occurred
      when the result of migration was an existing word. Similarity between words in a 
      pair did not increase error rates, and more migrations occurred when the words
      shared fewer letters. The between-word errors included the classic errors of
      migration of a letter between words, but also omission of one instance of a
      letter that appeared in the same position in the two words, an error that
      constituted a considerable percentage of the between-word errors, and intrusion
      of a letter from one word to the corresponding position in the neighboring word
      without erasing the original letter in the same position.

PG  - 1317-29
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.06.010 [doi]
AB  - When two targets are presented within 500 msec of each other in rapid serial
      visual presentation (RSVP), the accuracy of second target identification is
      significantly reduced; a phenomenon termed the attentional blink. Recent studies 
      have reported that children and adults with dyslexia exhibit deficits tied to the
      attentional blink; however, some ambiguity remains as to the nature of these
      impairments and how they relate to reading difficulties. The current study aimed 
      to address these issues by examining attentional blink deficits in relation to
      orthographic, phonological, and fluency aspects of reading impairment. Twenty-two
      children with dyslexia were compared to 22 children with normally developing
      reading skills on an attentional blink task with results indicating the dyslexia 
      group exhibited impaired performance regardless of the temporal lag between
      targets. These deficits appeared tied to general RSVP performance rather than a
      prolonged attentional blink and differences between groups fell below
      significance when the influence of general performance factors were controlled
      for.

TI  - Spelling impairments in Italian dyslexic children: phenomenological changes in
      primary school.
PG  - 1299-311
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2010.06.015 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although spelling difficulties are constantly associated with
      developmental dyslexia, they have been largely neglected by the majority of
      studies in this area. This study analyzes spelling impairments in developmental
      dyslexia across school grades in Italian, a language with high
      grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence. METHODS: The performances of 33 Italian
      dyslexic children attending Grades 3 and 5 were compared with those of
      age-matched control participants. Writing abilities were investigated through a
      spelling test that included regular words with one-sound-to-one-letter
      correspondence, regular words requiring the application of context-sensitive
      conversion rules, words with unpredictable transcription and nonwords with
      one-sound-to-one-letter correspondence. RESULTS: Both accuracy and error analyses
      indicate that the spelling impairment assumes different characteristics at
      different grades: Grade 3 children showed an undifferentiated spelling deficit
      (involving regular words, regular nonwords and words with unpredictable
      spelling), whereas the fifth graders were prevalently impaired in writing words
      with unpredictable transcription. The error analysis confirms these results, with
      third graders producing a high rate of all types of errors (i.e., phonologically 
      plausible, simple and context-sensitive conversion errors), whereas most errors
      committed by fifth graders were phonologically plausible. CONCLUSIONS: Results
      are coherent with the hypothesis that dyslexic children learning a shallow
      orthography suffer from delayed acquisition and some fragility of the sub-word
      level routine, together with a severe and long-lasting deficit of orthographic
      lexical acquisition.

AB  - We report two cases of developmental hyperlexia - JY and AD - who performed at
      normal levels or above in converting print into speech, but who were very
      impaired in spoken and written word comprehension. Our investigations focussed on
      whether these cases displayed evidence for normal acquisition of lexical reading 
      skills, as indexed by unimpaired performance for age in reading aloud a set of
      irregular words, despite poor acquisition of semantic knowledge of the same
      words. In both cases, this dissociation was evident. The pattern of results was
      also demonstrated at an item level: the two cases showed no significant
      differences in reading accuracy for irregular words which they could define than 
      for those which they could not. The results provide further evidence for the
      existence of a direct-lexical route from orthography to phonology, which is not
      necessarily mediated by semantic knowledge.

LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.06.007 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated letter recognition processing in Italian developmental
      dyslexics and its potential contribution to word reading. Letter/bigram
      recognition (naming and matching) and reading of words and non-words were
      examined. A group of developmental dyslexics and a chronologically age-matched
      group of skilled readers were examined. Dyslexics were significantly slower than 
      skilled readers in all tasks. The rate and amount model (RAM, Faust et al., 1999)
      was used to detect global and specific factors in the performance differences
      controlling for the presence of over-additivity effects. Two global factors
      emerged. One ("letter-string" factor) accounted for the performance in all (and
      only) word and non-word reading conditions, indicating a large impairment in
      dyslexics (more than 100% reaction time - RT increase as compared to skilled
      readers). All the letter/bigram tasks clustered on a separate factor ("letter"
      factor) indicating a mild impairment (ca. 20% RT increase as compared to skilled 
      readers). After controlling for global factor influences by the use of the
      z-score transformation, specific effects were detected for the "letter-string"
      (but not the "letter") factor. Stimulus length exerted a specific effect on
      dyslexics' performance, with dyslexics being more affected by longer stimuli;
      furthermore, dyslexics showed a stronger impairment for reading words than
      non-words. Individual differences in the "letter" and "letter-string" factors
      were uncorrelated, pointing to the independence of the impairments. The putative 
      mechanisms underlying the two global factors and their possible relationship to
      developmental dyslexia are discussed.

      moderate effect size.
PG  - 1556-79
LID - 10.1037/a0020612 [doi]
AB  - Despite impressive advances in the science of reading intervention, how to best
      help at-risk readers remains a point of contention. Because reading represents
      the synthesis of background factors and language and reading skills-all of which 
      develop with age and experience-this meta-analysis investigated whether
      development (as approximated by grade) and intervention modality are key
      moderators of intervention effect size for disadvantaged readers. Eighty-five
      experimental or quasi-experimental studies with 116 treatment-control groups (N =
      7,522) were selected from preschool to Grade 7. Analyses accounted for
      intervention length, instructor-to-student ratio, measure design, experimental
      design, attrition, intervention language, and publication bias. Between-group
      comparisons suggested that effect sizes were larger for older students,
      comprehension interventions, quasi-experimental studies, and samples at greater
      risk. In hierarchical regression analyses, intervention modality alone did not
      explain additional variance in effect size; however, when interacting with grade,
      intervention modality did explain additional variance. Phonics interventions were
      more effective until Grade 1, after which comprehension and mixed interventions, 
      in particular, tended to be associated with greater effect sizes. These results
      highlight the importance of a developmental understanding of reading remediation.

      behavioral studies.
PG  - 341-57
LID - 10.1002/dys.412 [doi]
AB  - The magnitude of the association between developmental dyslexia (DD) and motion
      sensitivity is evaluated in 35 studies, which investigated coherence motion
      perception in DD. A first analysis is conducted on the differences between DD
      groups and age-matched control (C) groups. In a second analysis, the relationship
      between motion coherence threshold and reading ability is considered. Globally,
      the mean effect size (ES) is moderate (d = 0.675, 2334 subjects) with a large
      value (d = 0.747) for the between-groups differences in motion perception and a
      smaller mean ES (d = 0.178) for the correlational studies. The influence on ES of
      the stimuli parameters and subjects age is analyzed. The number of dots, the age 
      of the subjects, and the type of analysis (i.e. between-group or correlational)
      are significantly related to the ES. Looking at the ES values, a smaller number
      of dots constituting the stimuli are associated with larger ES and,
      interestingly, the children studies are associated with lower ES in comparison
      with the researches evaluating adults. The large ES value supports the importance
      of studying motion perception deficits in DD groups, consistently with the claim 
      that dorsal impairment/noise-exclusion deficit could be one of the risk factor of
      reading difficulties.

      of inattentiveness and IQ.
PG  - 1083-95
LID - 10.1007/s10802-010-9429-7 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have documented the primarily genetic aetiology for the stronger
      phenotypic covariance between reading disability and ADHD inattention symptoms,
      compared to hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms. In this study, we examined to
      what extent this covariation could be attributed to "generalist genes" shared
      with general cognitive ability or to "specialist" genes which may specifically
      underlie processes linking inattention symptoms and reading difficulties. We used
      multivariate structural equation modeling on IQ, parent and teacher ADHD ratings 
      and parent ratings on reading difficulties from a general population sample of
      1312 twins aged 7.9-10.9 years. The covariance between reading difficulties and
      ADHD inattention symptoms was largely driven by genetic (45%) and child-specific 
      environment (21%) factors not shared with IQ and hyperactivity-impulsivity; only 
      11% of the covariance was due to genetic effects common with IQ. Aetiological
      influences shared among all phenotypes explained 47% of the variance in reading
      difficulties. The current study, using a general population sample, extends
      previous findings by showing, first, that the shared genetic variability between 
      reading difficulties and ADHD inattention symptoms is largely independent from
      genes contributing to general cognitive ability and, second, that child-specific 
      environment factors, independent from IQ, also contribute to the covariation
      between reading difficulties and inattention symptoms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dyslexia is a learning disability in which reading (but not any
      other) impairment is the most prominent symptom. There seems to be a high
      comorbidity among dyslexia and other learning disabilities, such as SLI, SSD or
      ADHD. DEVELOPMENT: The nulear deficit in dyslexia appears to correspond to an
      impairment in phonological processing. Structural and functional studies in
      dyslexic readers converge to indicate the presence of malformations in the brain 
      areas corresponding to the reading systems, but also a failure of these systems
      to function properly during reading. Genes linked (or associated) to dyslexia
      have been shown to be involved in neuronal migration and axon guidance during the
      formation of the cortex. In the developing cerebral neocortex of rats, local loss
      of function of most of these genes not only results in abnormal neuronal
      migration and neocortical and hippocampal malformations, but also in deficits
      related to auditory processing and learning. While the structural malformations
      resemble neuronal migration abnormalities observed in the brains of individuals
      with developmental dyslexia, processing/learning deficits also resemble deficits 
      described in individuals affected by the disease. CONCLUSIONS: On the whole,
      dyslexia seems to be on a continuum with typical reading at different biological 
      levels (genetic, biochemical, physiological, cognitive). Furthermore, certain
      elements belonging to some of these levels (mainly -some of the- genes linked or 
      associated to the disease, but also -some of the- neuronal structures whose
      development is regulated by these genes) would simultaneously belong to those of 
      other cognitive abilities, which give rise to diseases of a different nature
      (i.e. non- dyslexic impairments) when they are impaired.

      with difficulties in reading and writing:usefulness of a
      clinical-symptoms-checklist].
PG  - 437-42
AB  - We investigated the clinical symptoms of children with developmental dyslexia
      (DD) and evaluated the relationship between these symptoms and their Hiragana
      reading abilities. In order to detect the clinical symptoms of DD, we newly
      developed a clinical-symptoms-checklist (CL), which consisted of a total of 30
      yes/no questions regarding symptoms linked to reading (15 questions) and writing 
      (15 questions). Subjects were 98 Japanese school grade (1 to 9) children, aged 6 
      to 15 years old, with normal intelligence confirmed by the Wechsler Intelligence 
      Test for Children (WISC-Ill) and they were divided into 2 groups according to
      their diagnosis. Twenty four children diagnosed as developmental dyslexia
      consisted the DD group, and the remaining 74 children were grouped in the non-DD 
      group. CL showed significant construct validity (p<0.05) and inner consistency
      (reading: a =0.82, writing: a =0.72) after deleting two questions from the
      originals. The number of questions checked in the CL reading subcategory
      significantly correlated with the Hiragana reading ability of articulation time
      in all Hiragana reading tasks (p<0.001). More severe clinical symptoms and lower 
      reading ability were observed in the DD group compared to the non-DD group.
      Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis indicated that these two groups
      could be discriminated by the CL and the results of the reading task, and both
      sensitivity and specificity rate were approximately 80%. It was suggested that 7 
      or more positive checks in the CL and 2 or more abnormal scores in the reading
      tasks might discriminate DD from other conditions which cause difficulties in
      reading and writing in Japanese children.

TI  - Identification of candidate genes for dyslexia susceptibility on chromosome 18.
PG  - e13712
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0013712 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Six independent studies have identified linkage to chromosome 18 for 
      developmental dyslexia or general reading ability. Until now, no candidate genes 
      have been identified to explain this linkage. Here, we set out to identify the
      gene(s) conferring susceptibility by a two stage strategy of linkage and
      association analysis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Linkage analysis: 264 UK
      families and 155 US families each containing at least one child diagnosed with
      dyslexia were genotyped with a dense set of microsatellite markers on chromosome 
      18. Association analysis: Using a discovery sample of 187 UK families, nearly
      3000 SNPs were genotyped across the chromosome 18 dyslexia susceptibility
      candidate region. Following association analysis, the top ranking SNPs were then 
      genotyped in the remaining samples. The linkage analysis revealed a broad signal 
      that spans approximately 40 Mb from 18p11.2 to 18q12.2. Following the association
      analysis and subsequent replication attempts, we observed consistent association 
      with the same SNPs in three genes; melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), dymeclin (DYM)
      and neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-like
      (NEDD4L). CONCLUSIONS: Along with already published biological evidence, MC5R,
      DYM and NEDD4L make attractive candidates for dyslexia susceptibility genes.
      However, further replication and functional studies are still required.

TI  - The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of dyslexia.
PG  - 718-26; quiz 27
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.2010.0718 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reading and spelling disorder (dyslexia) is one of the more common
      specific developmental disorders, with a prevalence of approximately 5%. It is
      characterized by severe impairment of learning to read and spell. METHODS: We
      discuss major aspects of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of dyslexia on 
      the basis of a selective literature review and the guidelines of the German
      Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy.
      RESULTS: 40% to 60% of dyslexic children have psychological manifestations,
      including anxiety, depression, and attention deficit. The diagnostic assessment
      of dyslexia consists of a battery of standardized reading and spelling tests and 
      an evaluation of the child's psychological state, including additional
      information obtained from parents and teachers. The treatment of dyslexia is
      based on two main strategies: specific assistance with the impaired learning
      areas (reading and spelling) and psychotherapy for any coexisting psychological
      disturbance that may be present. Evaluated preventive strategies are available
      for use in kindergarten and at home. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of dyslexia should
      be established with the aid of the multiaxial classification system. The benefit 
      of specific treatment strategies for dyslexia has not yet been demonstrated
      empirically. Nonetheless, evaluated prevention programs are available in
      kindergarten that have been found to promote children's ability to acquire
      reading and spelling skills in school.

TI  - The visual magnocellular pathway in Chinese-speaking children with developmental 
      dyslexia.
PG  - 3627-33
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.08.015 [doi]
AB  - Previous research into the cognitive processes involved in reading Chinese and
      developmental dyslexia in Chinese, revealed that the single most important factor
      appears to be orthographic processing skills rather than phonological skills.
      Also some studies have indicated that even in alphabetic languages some dyslexic 
      individuals reveal deficits in orthographic processing skills, which are linked
      to a deficit in the visual magnocellular pathway. The current study therefore
      employed a visual psychophysical experiment together with visual and auditory
      event-related potential (ERP) experiments eliciting mismatch negativity (MMN) to 
      investigate the link between visual magnocellular functional abnormalities and
      developmental dyslexia in Chinese. The performance levels of Chinese children
      with developmental dyslexia (DD) from the behavioural and electrophysiological
      experiments were compared to those of the chronological age-matched (CA) children
      and those of the reading level matched (RL) younger children. Both the
      behavioural and electrophysiological results suggest that the orthographic
      processing skills were compromised in the Chinese developmental dyslexics, which 
      in turn is linked to a deficit in the visual magnocellular system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporal auditory processing and developmental dyslexia. AIM: To
      characterize the temporal auditory processing in children with developmental
      dyslexia and to correlate findings with cortical malformations. METHOD: Twenty
      school-aged children, ranging in age from 8 to 14 years were evaluated. These
      children were divided into two groups: the experimental group (EG) was composed
      by 11 children (eight were male) with developmental dyslexia and the control
      group (CG) was composed by nine normal children (six were male). After
      neurological assessment and verification of the intellectual level, language,
      reading and writing skills in order to determine the diagnosis, children
      underwent a peripheral audiological evaluation and Random Gap Detection Test
      and/or Random Gap Detection Test Expanded. RESULTS: A statistically significant
      difference between children in the EG and CG were observed, with children in the 
      EG presenting worst performances. Most of the children in the EG presented
      perisylvian polymicrogyria. CONCLUSION: Children with developmental dyslexia may 
      present temporal auditory processing disorders with deficits in phonological
      processing. Cortical malformations may be the anatomical substrate of these
      disorders.

TI  - Is the visual analyzer orthographic-specific? Reading words and numbers in letter
      position dyslexia.
PG  - 982-1004
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.08.007 [doi]
AB  - Letter position dyslexia (LPD) is a deficit in the encoding of letter position
      within words. It is characterized by errors of letter migration within words,
      such as reading trail as trial and form as from. In order to examine whether LPD 
      is domain-specific, and to assess the domain-specificity of the visual analysis
      system, this study explored whether LPD extends to number reading, by testing
      whether individuals who have letter migrations in word reading also show
      migrations while reading numbers. The reading of words and numbers of 12
      Hebrew-speaking individuals with developmental LPD was assessed. Experiment 1
      tested reading aloud of words and numbers, and Experiment 2 tested same-different
      decisions in words and numbers. The findings indicated that whereas the
      participants with developmental LPD showed a large number of migration errors in 
      reading words, 10 of them read numbers well, without migration errors, and not
      differently from the control participants. A closer inspection of the pattern of 
      errors in words and numbers of two individuals who had migrations in both numbers
      and words showed qualitative differences in the characteristics of migration
      errors in the two types of stimuli. In word reading, migration errors appeared
      predominantly in middle letters, whereas the errors in numbers occurred mainly in
      final (rightmost) digits. Migrations in numbers occurred almost exclusively in
      adjacent digits, but in words migrations occurred both in adjacent and in
      nonadjacent letters. The results thus indicate that words can be selectively
      impaired, without a parallel impairment in numbers, and that even when numbers
      are also impaired they show different error pattern. Thus, the visual analyzer is
      actually an orthographic visual analyzer, a module that is domain-specific for
      the analysis of words.

TI  - [Do children with cochlear implants read or write differently?: literacy
      acquisition after cochlear implantation].
PG  - 934-46
LID - 10.1007/s00106-010-2088-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that literacy acquisition in hearing impaired
      children is frequently hampered, reading and writing competences continue not to 
      be regularly evaluated and documented in children fitted with cochlear implants
      (CI). In this 2-year longitudinal study literacy acquisition in children fitted
      with CI was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 18 pre- and primary
      school children fitted with CI who had suffered prelingual deafness were
      examined. Subjects' ages at CI fitting ranged from 0.9 to 5.9 years; they were
      raised orally and monolingual German and showed normal intellectual achievement. 
      Familial risk of developing dyslexia was ruled out. To assess subjects' literacy 
      acquisition precursor and partial abilities in reading and writing according to
      dual route and developmental models were examined three times within 2 years.
      Precursor abilities included development of vocabulary and phonological
      awareness. Partial abilities were mastery in sublexical and lexical word
      processing in reading and writing as well as auditory and visual working memory. 
      RESULTS: Subjects showed a broad range in performance regarding vocabulary
      development as well as literacy. Discrepant results in terms of age equivalent
      visual and underachievement in auditory working memory as well as good
      achievement in implicit phonological awareness and weakness in explicit demands
      on phoneme analysis and manipulation of phonemes can be described. Indications
      were that subjects tended towards lip reading the instructor's item presentation.
      Performance in the administered writing test reveals a preference for lexical
      word processing, whereas sublexical word processing seems to make relatively
      higher demands on subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Easier processing of visual information 
      in partial and precursor abilities are consistent with a tendency to prefer a
      visual-lexical processing strategy. The presented study stresses the importance
      of generally assessing reading and writing skills when evaluating language
      development in children supplied with cochlear implants. Partial and precursor
      abilities should be included in order to identify any delay in development
      promptly. Thus, individual qualitative characteristics can be addressed in
      therapeutic intervention.

PG  - 533-44
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181ef42a1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article has 2 primary goals. First, a brief tutorial on
      behavioral and molecular genetic methods is provided for readers without
      extensive training in these areas. To illustrate the application of these
      approaches to developmental disorders, etiologically informative studies of
      reading disability (RD), math disability (MD), and attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are then reviewed. Implications of the results for 
      these specific disorders and for developmental disabilities as a whole are
      discussed, and novel directions for future research are highlighted. METHOD:
      Previous family and twin studies of RD, MD, and ADHD are reviewed systematically,
      and the extensive molecular genetic literatures on each disorder are summarized. 
      To illustrate 4 novel extensions of these etiologically informative approaches,
      new data are presented from the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center,
      an ongoing twin study of the etiology of RD, ADHD, MD, and related disorders.
      CONCLUSIONS: RD, MD, and ADHD are familial and heritable, and co-occur more
      frequently than expected by chance. Molecular genetic studies suggest that all 3 
      disorders have complex etiologies, with multiple genetic and environmental risk
      factors each contributing to overall risk for each disorder. Neuropsychological
      analyses indicate that the 3 disorders are each associated with multiple
      neuropsychological weaknesses, and initial evidence suggests that comorbidity
      between the 3 disorders is due to common genetic risk factors that lead to slow
      processing speed.

AB  - Earlier results from the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia showed that
      newborn event-related potentials (ERPs) of children with and without familial
      risk for dyslexia were associated with receptive language and verbal memory
      skills between 2.5 and 5 years of age. We further examined whether these ERPs
      (responses to synthetic consonant-vowel syllables /ba/, /da/, /ga/; presented
      equiprobably with 3,910-7,285 ms interstimulus intervals) predict later
      pre-reading skills measured before the onset of school (6.5 years of age). In
      line with our earlier results, the at-risk children (N = 11) with atypical speech
      processing in the right hemisphere (a slower shift in polarity from positivity to
      negativity in responses to /ga/ at 540-630 ms) scored significantly lower in
      phonological skills, rapid naming, and letter knowledge than the control children
      (N = 10) without enhanced right hemispheric speech processing. These results
      further extend our earlier findings of newborn ERPs in predicting poorer language
      skills. These consistent differences in ERPs to speech sounds may have
      applications in the future for the early identification of children at risk for
      developmental language problems. This would facilitate well-directed intervention
      even before reading problems are typically diagnosed.

PG  - 1243-8
LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2010.05.015 [doi]
AB  - The term "dyspraxia" was coined by Julian de Ajuriaguerra and Mira Stambak in
      1964. This clinical term was treated very differently according to which
      explanatory model was adopted. Nowadays, it is used to refer to developmental
      coordination disorder in view of its neuro-developmental origin. In any case, the
      actual clinical situations vary and are often complex. In our opinion, it is
      first necessary to examine the differential diagnosis: apraxia in children caused
      by lesions, dysgraphia, simply delayed motor development, non-verbal learning
      disability syndrome, hemispheric specialisation deficits, pervasive developmental
      disorders (autisms, Asperger syndrome, atypical autism and other pervasive
      developmental disorders), mixed specific developmental disorders, multiple
      developmental disorder, and children with high potential. Next we focus on
      co-morbidity. Firstly, we look at psychopathological disorders associated with
      dyspraxia: autism and pervasive developmental disorders, dyscalculia/math
      disability, dyslexia/reading difficulties, dysphasia accompanied by verbal
      dyspraxia, intelligence deficiency, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Secondly, we examine psychopathological disorders 
      associated with dyspraxia. Children with developmental coordination disorder are 
      less inclined to participate in collective games. As a result, there is a greater
      risk of them becoming lonely and isolated. They have higher child behaviour
      checklist (CBCL) scores in the somatic problems scale as well as for anxiety,
      depression and social withdrawal. They have low self-perception in sports as well
      as at school, which is related to their physical appearance and their
      self-esteem, attention deficit and externalized behaviour. These children are
      often at risk of academic failure and they suffer from oppositional defiant
      disorder and functional disorders. And finally, we believe that it is important
      to touch on the impact of these disorders on the family.

TI  - Visual spatial attention and speech segmentation are both impaired in
      preschoolers at familial risk for developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 226-39
LID - 10.1002/dys.413 [doi]
AB  - Phonological skills are foundational of reading acquisition and impaired
      phonological processing is widely assumed to characterize dyslexic individuals.
      However, reading by phonological decoding also requires rapid selection of
      sublexical orthographic units through serial attentional orienting, and recent
      studies have shown that visual spatial attention is impaired in dyslexic
      children. Our study investigated these different neurocognitive dysfunctions,
      before reading acquisition, in a sample of preschoolers including children with
      (N=20) and without (N=67) familial risk for developmental dyslexia. Children were
      tested on phonological skills, rapid automatized naming, and visual spatial
      attention. At-risk children presented deficits in both visual spatial attention
      and syllabic segmentation at the group level. Moreover, the combination of visual
      spatial attention and syllabic segmentation scores was more reliable than either 
      single measure for the identification of at-risk children. These findings suggest
      that both visuo-attentional and perisylvian-auditory dysfunctions might adversely
      affect reading acquisition, and may offer a new approach for early identification
      and remediation of developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 213-25
LID - 10.1002/dys.410 [doi]
AB  - The reduced verbal long-term memory capacities often reported in dyslexics are
      generally interpreted as a consequence of their deficit in phonological
      coding.The present study was aimed at evaluating whether the learning deficit
      exhibited by dyslexics was restricted only to the verbal component of the
      long-term memory abilities or also involved visual-object and visual-spatial
      domain. A further goal of the present study was to investigate the predictive
      value of non-verbal long-term memory abilities with respect to word and non-word 
      reading in dyslexic children.In accordance with these aims, performances of 60
      dyslexic children were compared with that of 65 age-matched normal readers on
      verbal, visual-spatial and visual-object task.Results documented a generalized
      impairment of episodic long-term memory capacities in dyslexic children and the
      results did not vary as a function of children's age.Furthermore, in addition to 
      verbal measures, also individual differences in non-verbal long-term memory tasks
      turn out to be good predictors of reading difficulties in dyslexics.Our findings 
      indicate that the long-term memory deficit in dyslexia is not limited to the
      dysfunction of phonological components but also involves visual-object and
      visual-spatial aspect, thus suggesting that dyslexia is associated to multiple
      cognitive deficits.

TI  - Cyclic alternating pattern: A window into pediatric sleep.
PG  - 628-36
LID - 10.1016/j.sleep.2009.10.003 [doi]
AB  - Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) has now been studied in different age groups of 
      normal infants and children, and it is clear that it shows dramatic changes with 
      age. In this review we first focus on the important age-related changes of CAP
      from birth to peripubertal age and, subsequently, we describe the numerous
      studies on CAP in developmental clinical conditions such as pediatric sleep
      disordered breathing, disorders of arousal (sleep walking and sleep terror),
      pediatric narcolepsy, learning disabilities with mental retardation (fragile-X
      syndrome, Down syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome) or
      without (dyslexia, Asperger syndrome, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). 
      CAP rate is almost always decreased in these conditions with the exception of the
      disorders of arousal and some cases of sleep apnea. Another constant result is
      the reduction of A1 subtypes, probably in relationship with the degree of
      cognitive impairment. The analysis of CAP in pediatric sleep allows a better
      understanding of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of sleep
      disturbance. CAP can be considered as a window into pediatric sleep, allowing a
      new vision on how the sleeping brain is influenced by a specific pathology or how
      sleep protecting mechanisms try to counteract internal or external disturbing
      events.

LID - 10.1016/j.cognition.2010.03.015 [doi]
AB  - We report a study that investigated the widely held belief that naming-speed
      deficits in developmental dyslexia reflect impaired access to
      lexical-phonological codes. To investigate this issue, we compared adult dyslexic
      and adult non-dyslexic readers' performance when naming and semantically
      categorizing arrays of objects. Dyslexic readers yielded slower response
      latencies than non-dyslexic readers when naming objects, but a subsequent
      comparison of object-naming and object-categorization tasks showed that the
      apparent 'naming' deficit could be attributed to a more general difficulty in
      retrieving information - either phonological or semantic - from the visual
      stimulus. Our findings suggest that although visual-phonological connections may 
      be crucial in explaining naming-speed performance they do not fully characterise 
      dyslexic readers' naming-speed impairments.

      deficit in developmental dyslexia?
PG  - F8-F14
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00983.x [doi]
AB  - Visual-attentional theories of dyslexia predict deficits for dyslexic children
      not only for the perception of letter strings but also for non-alphanumeric
      symbol strings. This prediction was tested in a two-alternative forced-choice
      paradigm with letters, digits, and symbols. Children with dyslexia showed
      significant deficits for letter and digit strings but not for symbol strings.
      This finding is difficult to explain for visual-attentional theories of dyslexia 
      which postulate identical deficits for letters, digits and symbols. Moreover,
      dyslexics showed normal W-shaped serial position functions for letter and digit
      strings, which suggests that their deficit is not due to an abnormally small
      attentional window. Finally, the size of the deficit was identical for letters
      and digits, which suggests that poor letter perception is not just a consequence 
      of the lack of reading. Together then, our results show that symbols that map
      onto phonological codes are impaired (i.e. letters and digits), whereas symbols
      that do not map onto phonological codes are not impaired. This dissociation
      suggests that impaired symbol-sound mapping rather than impaired
      visual-attentional processing is the key to understanding dyslexia.

      dyslexia and dysgraphia.
PG  - 597-617
AB  - Cross-country, longitudinal twin studies provide strong evidence for both the
      biological and environmental basis of dyslexia, and the stability of genetic
      influences on reading and spelling, even when skills improve in response to
      instruction. Although DNA studies aimed at identifying gene candidates in
      dyslexia and related phenotypes (behavioral expression of underlying genotypes); 
      and imaging studies of brain differences between individuals with and without
      dyslexia and the brain's response to instructional treatment are increasing, this
      review illustrates, with the findings of one multidisciplinary research center,
      an emerging trend to investigate the inter-relationships among genetic, brain and
      instructional treatment findings in the same sample, which are interpreted in
      reference to a working-memory architecture, for dyslexia (impaired decoding and
      spelling) and/or dysgraphia (impaired handwriting). General principles for
      diagnosis and treatment, based on research with children who failed to respond to
      the regular instructional program, are summarized for children meeting research
      criteria for having or being at risk for dyslexia or dysgraphia. Research
      documenting earlier emerging specific oral language impairment during preschool
      years associated with reading and writing disabilities during school years is
      also reviewed. Recent seminal advances and projected future trends are discussed 
      for linking brain endophenotypes and gene candidates, identifying
      transchromosomal interactions, and exploring epigenetics (chemic al modifications
      of gene expression in response to developmental or environmental changes). Rather
      than providing final answers, this review highlights past, current and emerging
      issues in dyslexia research and practice.

AB  - We examined the influence of task complexity on implicit sequence learning in
      secondary-school-aged children with developmental dyslexia (DD). This was done to
      determine whether automatization problems in reading extend to the automatization
      of all skill and depend on the complexity of the to-be-learned skill. A total of 
      28 dyslexic children between 12 and 15 years and 28 matched control children
      carried out two serial reaction time tasks using a first-order conditional (FOC) 
      and second-order conditional (SOC) sequence. In both tasks, children incidentally
      learned a sequence of hidden target positions, but whereas FOC sequence learning 
      could be based on knowledge about the immediate preceding position, SOC sequence 
      learning required more complex knowledge about the previous two positions. The
      results demonstrated that sequence learning was highly comparable in dyslexic and
      control children, regardless of the sequence complexity. This shows that implicit
      sequence learning, as manifested in the present study, is maintained in DD and is
      unrelated to task complexity. We suggest that previous reports of
      sequence-learning deficits in DD can be accounted for by attenuated explicit
      sequence learning, possibly related to malfunctions in prefrontal processing. The
      present findings indicate that deficits in skill learning and automatization in
      DD are not general in nature, but task dependent.

LID - 10.1177/0022219410369078 [doi]
AB  - This article focuses on some of the linguistic components that underlie
      letter-sound decoding skills and reading comprehension: specifically phonology,
      morphology, and syntax. Many children who have reading difficulties had language 
      deficits that were detectable before they began reading. Early identification of 
      language difficulties will therefore help identify children at risk of reading
      failure. Using a developmental psycholinguistic framework, the authors provide a 
      model of how syntax, morphology, and phonology break down in children with
      language impairments. The article reports on a screening test of these language
      abilities for preschool or young school-aged children that identifies those at
      risk for literacy problems and in need of further assessment.

      dyslexia: evidence from event-related potentials.
PG  - 2447-57
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.04.017 [doi]
AB  - Dyslexia is characterized by a core phonological deficit, although recent studies
      indicate that semantic impairment also contributes to this condition. In this
      study, event-related potentials (ERP) were used to examine whether the N400 wave 
      in dyslexic children is modulated by phonological or semantic priming, similarly 
      to age-matched controls. ERPs were recorded while children listened to word lists
      in which the semantic and phonological congruency of the terminal words were
      manipulated. No overt judgments were made by participants. In control children
      the N400 amplitude to both semantically and phonologically incongruent words was 
      enlarged relative to congruent words. Dyslexic children exhibited a dissociation 
      of priming effects depending on whether semantic or phonological primes were
      used. Semantic priming elicited an N400 effect comparable to controls, though
      delayed. In phonological priming, the dyslexics differed from controls in both
      the phonologically incongruent and congruent conditions showing reduced N400
      amplitude in the former and enhanced N400 in the latter. This pattern suggests
      that when faced with phonological priming, dyslexics show abnormal neural
      responses related to both integration of similarities between the consecutive
      stimuli and the ability to detect incongruent stimuli. Semantic priming seems
      relatively intact in dyslexics, however neural responses to contextual
      incongruency are delayed.

AB  - The present study investigated basic numerical skills and arithmetic in adults
      with developmental dyslexia. Participants performed exact and approximate
      calculation, basic numerical tasks (e.g., counting; symbolic number comparison;
      spatial-numerical association of response codes, SNARC), and visuospatial tasks
      (mental rotation and visual search tasks). The group with dyslexia showed a
      marginal impairment in counting compared to age- and IQ-matched controls, and
      they were impaired in exact addition, in particular with respect to speed. They
      were also significantly slower in multiplication. In basic number processing,
      however, there was no significant difference in performance between those with
      dyslexia and controls. Both groups performed similarly on subtraction and
      approximate addition tasks. These findings indicate that basic number processing 
      in adults with dyslexia is intact. Their difficulties are restricted to the
      verbal code and are not associated with deficits in nonverbal magnitude
      representation, visual Arabic number form, or spatial cognition.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by severe reading and spelling
      difficulties that are persistent and resistant to the usual didactic measures and
      remedial efforts. It is well established that a major cause of these problems
      lies in poorly specified representations of speech sounds. One hypothesis states 
      that this phonological deficit results from a more fundamental deficit in
      auditory processing. Despite substantial research effort, the specific nature of 
      these auditory problems remains debated. A first controversy concerns the speech 
      specificity of the auditory processing problems: Can they be reduced to more
      basic auditory processing, or are they specific to the perception of speech
      sounds? A second topic of debate concerns the extent to which the auditory
      problems are specific to the processing of rapidly changing temporal information 
      or whether they encompass a broader range of complex spectro-temporal processing.
      By applying a balanced design with stimuli that were adequately controlled for
      acoustic complexity, we show that adults with dyslexia are specifically impaired 
      at categorizing speech and nonspeech sounds that differ in terms of rapidly
      changing acoustic cues (i.e., temporal cues), but that they perform adequately
      when categorizing steady-state speech and nonspeech sounds. Thus, we show that
      individuals with dyslexia have an auditory temporal processing deficit that is
      not speech-specific.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia in Chinese and English populations: dissociating the
      effect of dyslexia from language differences.
PG  - 1694-706
LID - 10.1093/brain/awq106 [doi]
AB  - Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that developmental dyslexia has a
      different neural basis in Chinese and English populations because of known
      differences in the processing demands of the Chinese and English writing systems.
      Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we provide the first direct
      statistically based investigation into how the effect of dyslexia on brain
      activation is influenced by the Chinese and English writing systems. Brain
      activation for semantic decisions on written words was compared in English
      dyslexics, Chinese dyslexics, English normal readers and Chinese normal readers, 
      while controlling for all other experimental parameters. By investigating the
      effects of dyslexia and language in one study, we show common activation in
      Chinese and English dyslexics despite different activation in Chinese versus
      English normal readers. The effect of dyslexia in both languages was observed as 
      less than normal activation in the left angular gyrus and in left middle frontal,
      posterior temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Differences in Chinese and
      English normal reading were observed as increased activation for Chinese relative
      to English in the left inferior frontal sulcus; and increased activation for
      English relative to Chinese in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus. These
      cultural differences were not observed in dyslexics who activated both left
      inferior frontal sulcus and left posterior superior temporal sulcus, consistent
      with the use of culturally independent strategies when reading is less efficient.
      By dissociating the effect of dyslexia from differences in Chinese and English
      normal reading, our results reconcile brain activation results with a substantial
      body of behavioural studies showing commonalities in the cognitive manifestation 
      of dyslexia in Chinese and English populations. They also demonstrate the
      influence of cognitive ability and learning environment on a common neural system
      for reading.

      Evidence from two case studies.
PG  - 717-38
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.11.002 [doi]
AB  - While there is growing evidence that some dyslexic children suffer from a deficit
      in simultaneously processing multiple visually displayed elements, the precise
      nature of the deficit remains largely unclear. The aim of the present study is to
      investigate possible cognitive impairments at the source of this deficit in
      dyslexic children. The visual processing of simultaneously presented letters was 
      thus thoroughly assessed in two dyslexic children by means of a task that
      requires the report of briefly presented multi-letters arrays. A computational
      model of the attentional involvement in multi-object recognition (Bundesen, 1990,
      1998) served as framework for analysing the data. By combining psychophysical
      measurements with computational modelling, we demonstrated that the visual
      processing deficit of simultaneously displayed letters, observed in the two
      dyslexic individuals reported in the current study, stems from at least two
      distinct cognitive sources: a reduction of the rate of-letter-information uptake,
      and a limitation of the maximal number of elements extracted from a brief visual 
      display and stored in visual short-term memory. Possible relations between these 
      impairments and learning to read proficiently are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Developmental dyslexia has been associated with reduced
      interhemispheric neural connectivity in children. The present study investigated 
      functional interhemispheric connectivity in male dyslexic adults. METHODS: A
      group of 19 dyslexic men were compared to a group of 15 controls on
      interhemispheric coherence of the dominant frequency in the power spectrum during
      a visuo-spatial attention task. The coherence between a left hemisphere
      central-parietal electrode and the respective right hemisphere electrode and
      surrounding sites was analysed. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the dyslexic group
      demonstrated reduced, and more diffuse, interhemispheric coherence of alpha
      activity in the central-parietal cortex. No group differences in interhemispheric
      coherence were found on frontal, temporal or central sites. CONCLUSIONS: The
      deviant pattern of functional connectivity in dyslexics is suggestive of an
      altered development of neural circuitry that may lead to deficits in
      magnocellular processing.

TI  - White matter microstructural differences linked to left perisylvian language
      network in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 739-49
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.008 [doi]
AB  - Studies of dyslexia using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have reported fractional
      anisotropy (FA) differences in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and left
      temporo-parietal white matter, suggesting that impaired reading is associated
      with atypical white matter microstructure in these regions. These anomalies might
      reflect abnormalities in the left perisylvian language network, long implicated
      in dyslexia. While DTI investigations frequently report analyses on multiple
      tensor-derived measures (e.g., FA, orientation, tractography), it is uncommon to 
      integrate analyses to examine the relationships between atypical findings. For
      the present study, semi-automated techniques were applied to DTI data in an
      integrated fashion to examine white matter microstructure in 14 children with
      dyslexia and 17 typically developing readers (ages 7-16 years). Correlations of
      DTI metrics (FA and fiber orientation) to reading skill (accuracy and speed) and 
      to probabilistic tractography maps of the left perisylvian language tracts were
      examined. Consistent with previous reports, our findings suggest FA decreases in 
      dyslexia in LIFG and left temporo-parietal white matter. The LIFG FA finding
      overlaps an area showing differences in fiber orientation in an anterior left
      perisylvian language pathway. Additionally, a positive correlation of FA to
      reading speed was found in a posterior circuit previously associated with
      activation on functional imaging during reading tasks. Overall, integrating
      results from several complementary semi-automated analyses reveals evidence
      linking atypical white matter microstructure in dyslexia to atypical fiber
      orientation in circuits implicated in reading including the left perisylvian
      language network.

AB  - AIM: We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate the association between
      white-matter integrity and reading ability in a cohort of 28 children. Nineteen
      preterm children (14 males, five females; mean age 11 y 11 mo [SD 1 y 10 mo],
      mean gestational age 30.5 wks (SD 3.2), mean birthweight was 1455 g [SD 625]);
      and nine term children (five males, four females; mean age 12 y 8 mo [SD 2 y 5
      mo], mean gestational age 39.6 wks (SD 1.2), and mean birthweight 3877 g [SD
      473]). METHOD: We tested whether fractional anisotropy in a left hemisphere
      temporoparietal region and in the corpus callosum correlates with birthweight and
      scores on the following three subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of
      Achievement: word identification, word attack, and passage comprehension.
      RESULTS: Preterm children had lower reading scores than a comparison group for
      all reading subtests (p<0.05). We found significant correlations between
      birthweight and fractional anisotropy in the whole corpus callosum (p=0.001), and
      between fractional anisotropy and reading skill in the genu (p=0.001) and body
      (p=0.001) of the corpus callosum. The correlation between reading skill and
      fractional anisotropy in a left temporoparietal region previously associated with
      reading disability was not significant (p=0.095). INTERPRETATION: We conclude
      that perinatal white-matter injury of the central corpus callosum may have
      long-term developmental implications for reading performance.

TI  - Dyslexia and DCDC2: normal variation in reading and spelling is associated with
      DCDC2 polymorphisms in an Australian population sample.
PG  - 668-73

AB  - The 6p21-p22 chromosomal region has been identified as a developmental dyslexia
      locus both in linkage and association studies, the latter generating evidence for
      the doublecortin domain containing 2 (DCDC2) as a candidate gene at this locus
      (and also for KIAA0319). Here, we report an association between DCDC2 and reading
      and spelling ability in 522 families of adolescent twins unselected for reading
      impairment. Family-based association was conducted on 21 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in DCDC2 using quantitative measures of lexical processing
      (irregular-word reading), phonological decoding (non-word reading) and
      spelling-based measures of dyslexia derived from the Components of Reading
      Examination test. Significant support for association was found for rs1419228
      with regular-word reading and spelling (P=0.002) as well as irregular-word
      reading (P=0.004), whereas rs1091047 was significantly associated (P=0.003) with 
      irregular-word reading (a measure of lexical storage). Four additional SNPs
      (rs9467075, rs9467076, rs7765678 and rs6922023) were nominally associated with
      reading and spelling. This study provides support for DCDC2 as a risk gene for
      reading disorder, and suggests that this risk factor acts on normally varying
      reading skill in the general population.

PG  - 776-9
LID - 10.1177/0883073809346349 [doi]
AB  - Acute chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy can present similar to acute
      stroke with symptoms including aphasia, dysarthria, and hemiplegia.
      Differentiation based on clinical appearance is challenging, and physicians must 
      distinguish between the 2 conditions rapidly to institute appropriate therapies. 
      An 8-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy,
      including intrathecal methotrexate, presented to our emergency center with 2
      hours of expressive aphasia and flaccid right hemiplegia. Emergent magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained, demonstrating diffusion restriction within 
      bilateral corona radiata and centrum semiovale. Magnetic resonance perfusion
      revealed mildly increased perfusion, a finding inconsistent with ischemic stroke 
      and previously unreported in acute chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy
      without necrosis. This increased perfusion conclusively eliminated stroke from
      the clinical differential. Magnetic resonance perfusion imaging proved valuable
      to rapidly distinguish acute chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy from
      ischemia, and the evaluation of perfusion alterations in this disorder may
      provide further insight into the pathophysiology of this entity.

PG  - 22-6
LID - 10.1016/S0030-6657(10)70004-4 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The study aimed to assess the auditory skills in multi-handicapped children 
      with cochlear implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study assessed 34 children, who
      were implanted due to the bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss. Apart
      from the hearing loss, all of the subjects suffered from additional impairments
      (mild motor disabilities, cerebral palsy, cognitive disability, specific learning
      disability, behavioral disorders, sight impairment), 29 (85.29%) from more than
      one. Cochlear implantation took place in the Department of Otolaryngology at the 
      Medical University of Warsaw in Poland. The age at implantation ranged from 1.3
      to 7.5 years old (mean 3.2 years, SD 1.64). The retrospective review of medical
      charts, audiology and speech pathology records was based on Champions profile
      with evaluation at 6, 12, 18-24 months, and 3 years after implantation. When a
      patient had been referred for developmental evaluation by psychologist, this
      source of information was also used. RESULTS: All of the subjects suffered from
      additional impairments, and most of them presented more than one additional
      disability. Individually and as a group, these patients respond well to cochlear 
      implantation. The study population showed improvement in communication code in 31
      patients (91.18%), and no improvement in 3 patients (two of them had 6 months
      follow up and one 12 months follow-up). Also progress in auditory skills was
      noted in the study population, which was measured as the awareness in
      environmental sounds--Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP). CONCLUSIONS:
      Multi-handicapped children receive benefit from cochlear implantation. The rate
      of this improvement is slow but offers better quality of life due to better
      auditory-communication skills, better self-independence and social integration.
      The results of implantation in presented group of patients is encouraging.

TI  - Newborn infants learn during sleep.
PG  - 10320-3
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1005061107 [doi]
AB  - Newborn infants must rapidly adjust their physiology and behavior to the specific
      demands of the novel postnatal environment. This adaptation depends, at least in 
      part, on the infant's ability to learn from experiences. We report here that
      infants exhibit learning even while asleep. Bioelectrical activity from face and 
      scalp electrodes was recorded from neonates during an eye movement conditioning
      procedure in which a tone was followed by a puff of air to the eye. Sleeping
      newborns rapidly learned the predictive relationship between the tone and the
      puff. Additionally, in the latter part of training, these infants exhibited a
      frontally maximum positive EEG slow wave possibly reflecting memory updating. As 
      newborns spend most of their time sleeping, the ability to learn about external
      stimuli in the postnatal environment during nonawake states may be crucial for
      rapid adaptation and infant survival. Furthermore, because eyelid conditioning
      reflects functional cerebellar circuitry, this method potentially offers a unique
      approach for early identification of infants at risk for a range of developmental
      disorders including autism and dyslexia.

TI  - Vision in developmental disorders: is there a dorsal stream deficit?
PG  - 147-60
LID - 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2010.02.016 [doi]
AB  - The main aim of this review is to evaluate the proposal that several
      developmental disorders affecting vision share an impairment of the dorsal visual
      stream. First, the current definitions and common measurement approaches used to 
      assess differences in both local and global functioning within the visual system 
      are considered. Next, studies assessing local and global processing in the dorsal
      and ventral visual pathways are reviewed for five developmental conditions for
      which early to mid level visual abilities have been assessed: developmental
      dyslexia, autism spectrum disorders, developmental dyspraxia, Williams syndrome
      and Fragile X syndrome. The reviewed evidence is broadly consistent with the idea
      that the dorsal visual stream is affected in developmental disorders. However,
      the potential for a unique profile of visual abilities that distinguish some of
      the conditions is posited, given that for some of these disorders ventral stream 
      deficits have also been found. We conclude with ideas regarding future directions
      for the study of visual perception in children with developmental disorders using
      psychophysical measures.

      Error rates from three linguistic tasks significantly decreased and reading speed
      improved after the training. A significant positive correlation (r(12)=0.536) was
      found at posterior sites for the phonological task only, showing that those
      children who had the greatest reading speed enhancement showed the largest left
      posterior EEG beta power increase.

TI  - The nonword-reading deficit of disabled readers: a developmental interpretation.
PG  - 717-34
LID - 10.1037/a0019038 [doi]
AB  - This article presents empirical evidence challenging the received wisdom that a
      nonword-reading deficit is a characteristic trait of disabled readers. On the
      basis of 2 large-scale empirical studies using the reading-level match design, we
      argue that a nonword-reading deficit is the consequence of normal developmental
      differences in word-specific knowledge between disabled readers and younger
      normal readers (both groups being matched on real-word reading). The first study 
      shows that the nonword-reading deficit varies as a function of age and reading
      level and that this deficit is not typical for disabled readers. The second study
      demonstrates that a nonword-reading deficit crucially depends on the sensitivity 
      of the matching word reading task to detect age-related differences in
      word-specific knowledge between disabled and normal readers. We clarify how these
      findings can be interpreted within the current framework of the phonological
      deficit hypothesis and discuss implications for theories of reading development.

TI  - Do children with developmental dyslexia have impairments in implicit learning?
PG  - 143-61
LID - 10.1002/dys.400 [doi]
AB  - We explored implicit learning in a group of typically developing and
      developmental dyslexic primary school children (9-12 y) using a modified
      artificial grammar learning task. Performance was calculated using two measures
      of performance: a perfect free recall (PFR) score and a grammaticality judgment
      score. Both groups of children required the same amount of exposure to memorize
      the items (i.e. PFR performance) (t((30))=1.620, p>0.05; p-value reported
      two-tailed). However, repeated measures ANOVA (Participant type x Grammaticality 
      x Chunk strength) revealed a Participant type effect for grammaticality judgment 
      scores (F((1,30))=4.521, p<0.05; p-value reported two-tailed). Typically
      developing children showed above chance performance in terms of both
      grammaticality and chunk strength of the stimuli. Children with developmental
      dyslexia on the other hand, failed to show implicit learning irrespective of the 
      substring characteristics (i.e. grammaticality or chunk strength). We propose
      that children with developmental dyslexia may be impaired in their implicit rule 
      abstraction mechanism, which can partially explain their persistent reading
      problems.

TI  - Dyslexia and hyperlexia in bilinguals.
PG  - 99-118
LID - 10.1002/dys.402 [doi]
AB  - This study explores the nature of reading difficulties of two bilinguals in
      Kannada and English, which vary in their orthographic depth and script layout. VN
      and MS manifest two different types of reading disabilities, dyslexia and
      hyperlexia, respectively. The performance of VN was below average on Kannada and 
      English tests of phonemic awareness, spelling, and pseudoword naming. Despite his
      poor decoding skills, the listening comprehension skill both at the word level
      and at the sentence level of VN was within the normal range. VN, therefore, can
      be described to have developmental dyslexia. MS, in contrast, showed good
      decoding ability in both Kannada and English, but his listening and reading
      comprehension were poor in both languages. MS, therefore, displays a pattern of
      reading disability akin to that of hyperlexia. The deficits of both VN and MS,
      although dissimilar from each other, cut across the linguistic boundaries and
      affect their performance in both Kannada and English.

TI  - Multisensory spatial attention deficits are predictive of phonological decoding
      skills in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1011-25
LID - 10.1162/jocn.2009.21232 [doi]
AB  - Although the dominant approach posits that developmental dyslexia arises from
      deficits in systems that are exclusively linguistic in nature (i.e., phonological
      deficit theory), dyslexics show a variety of lower level deficits in sensory and 
      attentional processing. Although their link to the reading disorder remains
      contentious, recent empirical and computational studies suggest that spatial
      attention plays an important role in phonological decoding. The present
      behavioral study investigated exogenous spatial attention in dyslexic children
      and matched controls by measuring RTs to visual and auditory stimuli in
      cued-detection tasks. Dyslexics with poor nonword decoding accuracy showed a
      slower time course of visual and auditory (multisensory) spatial attention
      compared with both chronological age and reading level controls as well as
      compared with dyslexics with slow but accurate nonword decoding. Individual
      differences in the time course of multisensory spatial attention accounted for
      31% of unique variance in the nonword reading performance of the entire dyslexic 
      sample after controlling for age, IQ, and phonological skills. The present study 
      suggests that multisensory "sluggish attention shifting"-related to a
      temporoparietal dysfunction-selectively impairs the sublexical mechanisms that
      are critical for reading development. These findings may offer a new approach for
      early identification and remediation of developmental dyslexia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare sentence repetition performance of different groups of
      children with Auditory Processing Disorders (APD) and to examine the relationship
      between age or respectively nonverbal intelligence and sentence recall. MATERIAL:
      Nonverbal intelligence was measured with the COLOURED MATRICES, in addition the
      children completed a standardized test of SENTENCE REPETITION (SR) which requires
      to repeat spoken sentences (subtest of the HEIDELBERGER SPRACHENTWICKLUNGSTEST). 
      PARTICIPANTS: Three clinical groups (n=49 with monosymptomatic APD; n=29 with
      APD+developmental language impairment; n=14 with APD+developmental dyslexia); two
      control groups (n=13 typically developing peers without any clinical
      developmental disorder; n=10 children with slight reduced nonverbal
      intelligence). RESULTS: The analysis showed a significant group effect
      (p=0.0007). The best performance was achieved by the normal controls (T-score
      52.9; SD 6.4; Min 42; Max 59) followed by children with monosymptomatic APD
      (43.2; SD 9.2), children with the co-morbid-conditions APD+developmental dyslexia
      (43.1; SD 10.3), and APD+developmental language impairment (39.4; SD 9.4). The
      clinical control group presented the lowest performance, on average (38.6; SD
      9.6). Accordingly, language-impaired children and children with slight reductions
      in intelligence could poorly use their grammatical knowledge for SR. A
      statistically significant improvement in SR was verified with the increase of age
      with the exception of children belonging to the small group with lowered
      intelligence. This group comprised the oldest children. Nonverbal intelligence
      correlated positively with SR only in children with below average-range
      intelligence (0.62; p=0.054). CONCLUSION: The absence of APD, SLI as well as the 
      presence of normal intelligence facilitated the use of phonological information
      for SR.

AB  - We investigated the postnatal effects of embryonic knockdown and overexpression
      of the candidate dyslexia gene homolog Kiaa0319. We used in utero electroporation
      to transfect cells in E15/16 rat neocortical ventricular zone with either 1)
      small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting Kiaa0319, 2) a KIAA0319 expression
      construct, 3) Kiaa0319 shRNA along with KIAA0319 expression construct ("rescue"),
      or 4) a scrambled version of Kiaa0319 shRNA. Knockdown, but not overexpression,
      of Kiaa0319 resulted in periventricular heterotopias that contained large numbers
      of both transfected and non-transfected neurons. This suggested that Kiaa0319
      shRNA disrupts neuronal migration by cell autonomous as well as non-cell
      autonomous mechanisms. Of the Kiaa0319 shRNA-transfected neurons that migrated
      into the cortical plate, most migrated to their appropriate lamina. In contrast, 
      neurons transfected with the KIAA0319 expression vector attained laminar
      positions subjacent to their expected positions. Neurons transfected with
      Kiaa0319 shRNA exhibited apical, but not basal, dendrite hypertrophy, which was
      rescued by overexpression of KIAA0319. The results provide additional supportive 
      evidence linking candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes to migrational
      disturbances during brain development, and extends the role of Kiaa0319 to
      include growth and differentiation of dendrites.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dyslexia is a complex neurodevelopemental disorder that affects 5
      to 10% of school-age children. This condition consists in a specific learning
      disability with a neurological origin. These learning difficulties are unexpected
      in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of efficient classroom
      instruction. A range of neurobiological investigations suggests that disruption
      of the parieto-temporo-occipital systems underlies a failure of skilled reading
      to develop. The observation that dyslexia is both a familial and heritable
      problem was made early on and was confirmed by twin studies. They also suggested 
      that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Several loci have been 
      implicated in dyslexia, notably on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 15 and 18 and some
      candidate genes have been proposed, but no functional mutation has yet been
      identified. LITERATURE REVIEW: Dyslexia seldom appears isolated and dyslexic
      people are very likely to present other kinds of learning disabilities or
      psychiatric disorders. Specific language impairment, often with a mild outcome,
      is the most frequently associated with dyslexia. Indeed, late language
      development is often reported by dyslexic patients and also occurs more
      frequently among their siblings. Genetic linkage studies suggest some common
      genetic factor underlying this comorbidity. Dyscalculia is associated with
      dyslexia in 25% of cases, but most people with dyscalculia do not have any sign
      of dyslexia. The question of whether dyscalculia associated with dyslexia and
      dyscalculia itself rely on the same cognitive impairment is still controversial. 
      Impaired motor development is also a common feature that affects nearly 50% of
      dyslexics and dyslexia is frequent among dyspraxic patients. This association
      raises the discussion on the role of motor impairment in dyslexia's
      physiopathology and the cerebellar theory of dyslexia. Beyond its link with other
      learning disorders, the study of dyslexia's comorbidity highlights
      psychopathological issues. ADHD is the most frequent psychiatric disorder
      associated with dyslexia. Underpinnings of this link between the two disorders
      seem to rely on common cognitive and genetic factors. Some authors have proposed 
      a candidate gene ADRA2A to determine the condition including ADHD and dyslexia.
      In addition, dyslexics are exposed to a higher risk of anxiodepressive and
      behavioural disorders. Dyslexic children experience three times more behavioural 
      disorders and one third of children with behavioural problems turn out to be
      affected by dyslexia. The literature study reveals inconsistent findings about
      depressed mood among dyslexics, but evidence of a persistent increase in the rate
      of anxiety disorders. The authors put forward the impact of environmental factors
      to explain these psychiatric comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This review emphasizes
      dyslexia's comorbidities because they represent an important issue, both from a
      scientific and clinical point of view. Indeed, for clinicians, children showing
      multiple learning disabilities have specific reeducation and educational needs
      and dyslexics have a higher risk of emotional and behavioural disorders. On the
      other hand, dyslexia's comorbidity study provides a powerful method for
      researchers to investigate the still unknown physiopathology of dyslexia.

      developmental dyslexia: new insights using Granger causality.

AB  - The reading process takes place in a neuronal network comprising the inferior
      frontal, posterior dorsal and posterior ventral brain areas. It is suggested that
      developmental dyslexia is caused by a disruption of the two posterior network
      areas. What remains debatable is whether these areas are affected in their
      functionality or whether the neuronal networking (connectivity) of these areas
      suffer from a disturbed information transfer. Thus, it is of major interest to
      investigate the time flow of the directed information transfer (time variant
      connectivity) within the neuronal reading network of dyslexic subjects. We
      investigated adolescents with dyslexia and normal-reading controls with
      functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) with a
      paradigm addressing basic visual, orthographic and phonological processing. EEG
      data were analyzed with the time variant Granger causality index (tvGCI) to
      investigate the temporal order of the directed information transfer (time variant
      causal connectivity: which network node passes when information to which network 
      node) during reading in dyslexic readers. Results show that the reading network
      of dyslexic readers comprises the same brain areas as identified in
      normal-reading subjects. The tvGCI analysis of the network profiles of dyslexic
      readers indicates that dyslexics show a difference in timing and localization of 
      connectivity within this reading network compared to normal readers. Dyslexic
      readers use right hemisphere language areas to counterbalance posterior left
      hemisphere processing deficits. The compensatory involvement of homologue right
      hemisphere brain areas for the reading process may be the neurobiological
      background for the significantly longer reading times by dyslexics.

LID - 10.1080/13554790903329158 [doi]
AB  - The impairment of phonological short-term memory has been reported in adults with
      cerebellar lesions. At the same time, a role of the cerebellum in speech
      production has been hypothesized. Cerebellar malformations have been related to
      developmental problems and language acquisition in children. We describe a
      5-year-old male child with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia who presented a severe
      linguistic deficit. On language testing, verbal production was almost absent,
      while comprehension was partially spared. Digit span was markedly reduced. An
      extensive examination of phonological short-term memory confirmed a deficit at
      this level. Positron Emission Tomography revealed hypometabolism both in the
      cerebellum and the supratentorial areas involved in language function. This
      finding supports the hypothesis that the cerebellum is included in a
      cerebro-cerebellar network, that underlies the phonological short-term memory,
      whose integrity is necessary for language acquisition.

TI  - Growth of reading skills in children with a history of specific language
      impairment: the role of autistic symptomatology and language-related abilities.
PG  - 109-31
AB  - Individuals with a history of specific language impairment (SLI) often have
      subsequent problems with reading skills, but there have been some discrepant
      findings as to the developmental time course of these skills. This study
      investigates the developmental trajectories of reading skills over a 9-year
      time-span (from 7 to 16 years of age) in a large sample of individuals with a
      history of SLI. Relationships among reading skills, autistic symptomatology, and 
      language-related abilities were also investigated. The results indicate that both
      reading accuracy and comprehension are deficient but that the development of
      these skills progresses in a consistently parallel fashion to what would be
      expected from a normative sample of same age peers. Language-related abilities
      were strongly associated with reading skills. Unlike individuals with SLI only,
      those with SLI and additional autistic symptomatology had adequate reading
      accuracy but did not differ from the individuals with SLI only in reading
      comprehension. They exhibited a significant gap between what they could read and 
      what they could understand when reading. These findings provide strong evidence
      that individuals with SLI experience continued, long-term deficits in reading
      skills from childhood to adolescence.

TI  - Developmental disorders of language and literacy: special issue.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - Language and literacy are cognitive skills of exceptional complexity. It is
      therefore not surprising that they are at risk of impairment either during
      development or as a result of damage (e.g. stroke) later in life. Impaired
      language and literacy can arise from a general learning impairment. However, two 
      developmental disorders, specific language impairment (SLI) and dyslexia, which
      affect oral and written language, respectively, are 'specific' in that they are
      not part of a more general learning difficulty. SLI and dyslexia each affect
      5-10% of the general population, and they are the focus of the papers in this
      special issue.

TI  - Deviant processing of letters and speech sounds as proximate cause of reading
      failure: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of dyslexic children.
PG  - 868-79
LID - 10.1093/brain/awp308 [doi]
AB  - Learning to associate auditory information of speech sounds with visual
      information of letters is a first and critical step for becoming a skilled reader
      in alphabetic languages. Nevertheless, it remains largely unknown which brain
      areas subserve the learning and automation of such associations. Here, we employ 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to study letter-speech sound integration in
      children with and without developmental dyslexia. The results demonstrate that
      dyslexic children show reduced neural integration of letters and speech sounds in
      the planum temporale/Heschl sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus. While
      cortical responses to speech sounds in fluent readers were modulated by
      letter-speech sound congruency with strong suppression effects for incongruent
      letters, no such modulation was observed in the dyslexic readers. Whole-brain
      analyses of unisensory visual and auditory group differences additionally
      revealed reduced unisensory responses to letters in the fusiform gyrus in
      dyslexic children, as well as reduced activity for processing speech sounds in
      the anterior superior temporal gyrus, planum temporale/Heschl sulcus and superior
      temporal sulcus. Importantly, the neural integration of letters and speech sounds
      in the planum temporale/Heschl sulcus and the neural response to letters in the
      fusiform gyrus explained almost 40% of the variance in individual reading
      performance. These findings indicate that an interrelated network of visual,
      auditory and heteromodal brain areas contributes to the skilled use of
      letter-speech sound associations necessary for learning to read. By extending
      similar findings in adults, the data furthermore argue against the notion that
      reduced neural integration of letters and speech sounds in dyslexia reflect the
      consequence of a lifetime of reading struggle. Instead, they support the view
      that letter-speech sound integration is an emergent property of learning to read 
      that develops inadequately in dyslexic readers, presumably as a result of a
      deviant interactive specialization of neural systems for processing auditory and 
      visual linguistic inputs.

TI  - The doublecortin gene family and disorders of neuronal structure.
PG  - 32-46
AB  - The doublecortin gene family is associated with subcortical band heterotopia,
      lissencephaly, epilepsy, developmental dyslexia and retinitis pigmentosa. At
      least 11 genes homologous to the doublecortin gene exist in humans and mice.
      Cellular processes regulated by different members of the doublecortin family
      involve neuronal migration, neurogenesis and eye receptor development. Underlying
      mechanisms include regulation of cytoskeletal structure and microtubule-based
      transport. Through their doublecortin-domains, doublecortin proteins can bind
      microtubules and regulate microtubule-dependent processes. However, this
      regulation is complex and involves many interacting proteins. Moreover, different
      spatiotemporal expression patterns and the generation of splice variants further 
      contribute to this complexity. The doublecortin-like kinase 1 gene in particular,
      produces splice variants with different protein domains such as
      doublecortin-domains, a serine, threonine and proline-rich domain and a
      serine/threonine kinase-domain. Here, we review our current knowledge on the
      doublecortin gene family with an emphasis on proteins interacting with
      doublecortin domains and other domains. In addition, to generate new hypotheses
      for further research, we analyzed the serine, threonine and proline-rich domain
      for predicted protein interactions.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a highly heritable disorder with a prevalence of at
      least 5% in school-aged children. Linkage studies have identified numerous loci
      throughout the genome that are likely to harbour candidate dyslexia
      susceptibility genes. Association studies and the refinement of chromosomal
      translocation break points in individuals with dyslexia have resulted in the
      discovery of candidate genes at some of these loci. A key function of many of
      these genes is their involvement in neuronal migration. This complements
      anatomical abnormalities discovered in dyslexic brains, such as ectopias, that
      may be the result of irregular neuronal migration.

PG  - 287-94
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02164.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to fully specify the profiles of risk and protective factors
      of developmental disorders, a better understanding of the conditions under which 
      they co-occur is required. So far, empirical evidence on comorbidities of
      specific learning disorders in arithmetic, reading and spelling is scarce.
      METHODS: Prevalence and gender ratios of specific learning disorders in
      arithmetic (AD), reading (RD), and spelling (SD) and their co-occurrence were
      assessed in a large (N = 2586) population-based sample of elementary school
      children and in a subsample of 293 children with at least one learning disorder
      (LD-sample). A questionnaire on familial transmission was given to a subsample of
      256 parents of children with a learning disorder and 146 typically developing
      children. RESULTS: The rates of deficits in arithmetic, reading, or spelling were
      four to five times higher in samples already experiencing marked problems in one 
      academic domain compared to the full population. Thus, comorbidity of learning
      disorders was confirmed in a fairly standard school population. Rates of
      co-occurrence decreased for AD and RD, but not isolated SD when more stringent
      cutoff criteria were applied, suggesting that the comorbidity of arithmetic and
      spelling disorder may be more strongly biologically mediated than the comorbidity
      of arithmetic and reading disorder. We found a preponderance of girls with AD and
      boys with SD. These imbalanced gender ratios were especially marked for isolated 
      problems, while for comorbid problems gender ratios were mostly balanced with the
      exception of deficits in arithmetic and reading (but not spelling) which were
      more typical for girls. The parental questionnaire provided evidence for
      disorder-specific familial transmission and co-segregation of arithmetic and
      literacy deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities of learning disorders are not
      artificial. They are the result of a complex interplay between both general and
      disorder-specific aetiological factors.

      attention, implicit learning, and executive functions. Results documented
      deficits in dyslexics on both phonological and non-phonological tasks. More
      stringently, in dyslexic children individual differences in non-phonological
      abilities accounted for 23.3% of unique variance in word reading and for 19.3% in
      non-word reading after controlling for age, IQ and phonological skills. These
      findings are in accordance with the hypothesis that DD is a multifactorial
      deficit and suggest that neurocognitive developmental dysfunctions in DD may not 
      be limited to the linguistic brain area, but may involve a more multifocal
      cortical system.

TI  - A case study of developmental phonological dyslexia: Is the attentional deficit
      in the perception of rapid stimuli sequences amodal?
PG  - 231-41
LID - 10.1016/j.cortex.2009.03.014 [doi]
AB  - The attentional blink (AB) refers to a decrease in accuracy that occurs when
      participants are required to detect the second of two rapidly sequential targets 
      displayed randomly in a stream of distracters. Dyslexic individuals have been
      shown to exhibit a prolonged AB in the visual modality, interpreted as evidence
      of sluggish attentional shifting (SAS). However, the amodal SAS theory predicts
      that the disorder should further extend to the auditory modality, then resulting 
      in a phonological disorder as typically found in developmental dyslexia.
      Otherwise, it has been demonstrated that a visual attention (VA) span deficit
      contributes to the poor reading outcome of dyslexic individuals, independently of
      their phonological skills. The present study assesses the amodality assumption of
      the SAS theory together with questioning its relation with the VA span deficit.
      For this purpose, visual and auditory ABs were explored in a well compensated
      young adult, LL, who exhibits a pure phonological dyslexia characterised by poor 
      pseudo-word processing and poor phonological skills but preserved VA span. The
      investigation revealed two different kinds of deficits in LL. Her AB was
      prolonged and marginally deeper in the visual modality whereas a primarily deeper
      in amplitude and a subtle prolonged AB was found in the auditory modality. The
      atypical performance patterns of LL in both modalities suggest that her
      perceptual attention disorder is amodal as predicted by the SAS theory. This
      amodal disorder was here reported in a dyslexic participant with a phonological
      disorder, well in accordance with the hypothesis that sluggish auditory attention
      shifting contributes to difficulties in phoneme awareness and literacy
      acquisition. Furthermore, prolonged VA blink was observed in the absence of VA
      span disorder, thus suggesting that visual attentional shifting and VA span might
      be distinct mechanisms, contributing independently to reading acquisition and
      developmental dyslexia.

AB  - The objective of the present research study was to understand what benefits the
      use of audiobooks (both school-books and books of various genres, recorded on
      digital media) could bring to preadolescents and adolescents with developmental
      dyslexia. Two groups, each consisting of 20 adolescents, were compared. The
      experimental group used the audiobooks, while the control group continued to use 
      normal books. After 5 months of experimental training, the experimental group
      showed a significant improvement in reading accuracy, with reduced unease and
      emotional-behavioural disorders, as well as an improvement in school performance 
      and a greater motivation and involvement in school activities.

TI  - Significance of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for the
      development and behaviour of children.
PG  - 149-64
LID - 10.1007/s00431-009-1035-8 [doi]
AB  - omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a central role in
      the normal development and functioning of the brain and central nervous system.
      Long-chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5omega-3),
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6omega-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4omega-6),
      in particular, are involved in numerous neuronal processes, ranging from effects 
      on membrane fluidity to gene expression regulation. Deficiencies and imbalances
      of these nutrients, not only during the developmental phase but throughout the
      whole life span, have significant effects on brain function. Numerous
      observational studies have shown a link between childhood developmental disorders
      and omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid imbalances. For instance, neurocognitive disorders
      such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, dyspraxia and 
      autism spectrum disorders are often associated with a relative lack of omega-3
      fatty acids. In addition to a high omega-6 fatty acid intake and, in many cases, 
      an insufficient supply of omega-3 fatty acids among the population, evidence is
      increasing to suggest that PUFA metabolism can be impaired in individuals with
      ADHD. In this context, PUFA imbalances are being discussed as potential risk
      factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. Another focus is whether the nutritive 
      PUFA requirements-especially long-chain omega-3 fatty acid requirements-are
      higher among some individuals. Meanwhile, several controlled studies investigated
      the clinical benefits of LC-PUFA supplementation in affected children and
      adolescents, with occasionally conflicting results.

TI  - Childhood auditory processing disorder as a developmental disorder: the case for 
      a multi-professional approach to diagnosis and management.
PG  - 83-7
LID - 10.3109/14992020903289808 [doi]
AB  - Auditory processing disorder (APD) is diagnosed when a patient presents with
      listening difficulties which can not be explained by a peripheral hearing
      impairment or higher-order cognitive or language problems. This review explores
      the association between auditory processing disorder (APD) and other specific
      developmental disorders such as dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder. The diagnosis and aetiology of APD are similar to those of other
      developmental disorders and it is well established that APD often co-occurs with 
      impairments of language, literacy, and attention. The genetic and neurological
      causes of APD are poorly understood, but developmental and behavioural genetic
      research with other disorders suggests that clinicians should expect APD to
      co-occur with other symptoms frequently. The clinical implications of
      co-occurring symptoms of other developmental disorders are considered and the
      review concludes that a multi-professional approach to the diagnosis and
      management of APD, involving speech and language therapy and psychology as well
      as audiology, is essential to ensure that children have access to the most
      appropriate range of support and interventions.

TI  - Dyslexia: a deficit in visuo-spatial attention, not in phonological processing.
PG  - 57-63
LID - 10.1016/j.tics.2009.12.003 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia affects up to 10 per cent of the population and it is
      important to understand its causes. It is widely assumed that phonological
      deficits, that is, deficits in how words are sounded out, cause the reading
      difficulties in dyslexia. However, there is emerging evidence that phonological
      problems and the reading impairment both arise from poor visual (i.e.,
      orthographic) coding. We argue that attentional mechanisms controlled by the
      dorsal visual stream help in serial scanning of letters and any deficits in this 
      process will cause a cascade of effects, including impairments in visual
      processing of graphemes, their translation into phonemes and the development of
      phonemic awareness. This view of dyslexia localizes the core deficit within the
      visual system and paves the way for new strategies for early diagnosis and
      treatment.

      processing?
PG  - 248-50
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Developmental learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dyscalculia have a high 
      rate of co-occurrence in pediatric populations, suggesting that they share
      underlying cognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms. Dyslexia and other
      developmental disorders with a strong heritable component have been associated
      with reduced sensitivity to coherent motion stimuli, an index of visual temporal 
      processing on a millisecond time-scale. Here we examined whether deficits in
      sensitivity to visual motion are evident in children who have poor mathematics
      skills relative to other children of the same age. We obtained psychophysical
      thresholds for visual coherent motion and a control task from two groups of
      children who differed in their performance on a test of mathematics achievement. 
      Children with math skills in the lowest 10% in their cohort were less sensitive
      than age-matched controls to coherent motion, but they had statistically
      equivalent thresholds to controls on a coherent form control measure. Children
      with mathematics difficulties therefore tend to present a similar pattern of
      visual processing deficit to those that have been reported previously in other
      developmental disorders. We speculate that reduced sensitivity to temporally
      defined stimuli such as coherent motion represents a common processing deficit
      apparent across a range of commonly co-occurring developmental disorders.

AB  - This study aimed at investigating the ERP correlates (N170 and P300 components)
      of a multimodal training program focused in dyslexia. ERPs were obtained from 32 
      electrodes in 24 French children with developmental dyslexia (mean age 10 years 7
      months) during a visual lexical decision task. All the children received two
      intensive two-month evidence-based training programs: one based on phonemic
      awareness and the other on visual and orthographic processing in a cross-over
      design. Ten control children matched on chronological age were also tested. We
      showed dissociation between N170, P300 and behavioral improvement. In the
      dyslexic group, P300 amplitude decreased for non-words and words as the latter
      yielded performance improvement. In the control group, the same effect was
      observed for pseudo-words. At the same time, the opposite pattern occurred for
      the N170 latency, which was shortened for pseudo-words and pseudo-homophones in
      the dyslexic group and for words in the typically achieving children. We argue
      that training might modulate cortical activity in dyslexic children in a visual
      word recognition task. Considering the well-known implication of P300 in
      attentional processes, our results reflect the strong link between reading skill 
      improvement after remediation and visual attentional process maturation.

TI  - The nature of the automatization deficit in Chinese children with dyslexia.
PG  - 405-15
LID - 10.1080/09297041003671200 [doi]
AB  - Clarifying whether automatization deficits constitute the primary causes or
      symptoms of developmental dyslexia, we focused on three critical issues of the
      dyslexic automatization deficit, namely universality, domain specificity, and
      severity. Thirty Chinese dyslexic children (mean age 10 years and 5 months), 30
      chronological-age-, and 30 reading-level-matched children were tested in 4 areas 
      of automaticity: motor, visual search, Stroop facilitation effects, and automatic
      word recognition. The results showed that the dyslexic children performed
      significantly worse than the CA-controls but not the RL-controls in all the tasks
      except for Stroop congruent-color words, on which they performed worse than
      children in both control groups. The deficits reflect a lag in reading
      experiences rather than a persistent cognitive deficit.

AB  - This study sought to replicate Herbert et al. (2003a), which found increased
      overall white matter (WM) volume in subjects with autism, even after controlling 
      for head size differences. To avoid the possibility that greater WM volume in
      autism is merely an epiphenomena of macrocephaly overrepresentation associated
      with the disorder, the current study included control subjects with benign
      macrocephaly. The control group also included subjects with a reading disability 
      to insure cognitive heterogeneity. WM volume in autism was significantly larger, 
      even when controlling for brain volume, rate of macrocephaly, and other
      demographic variables. Autism and controls differed little on whole-brain WM
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses suggesting that the overall increase in WM
      volume was non-localized. Autism subjects exhibited a differential pattern of IQ 
      relationships with brain volumetry findings from controls. Current theories of
      brain overgrowth and their importance in the development of autism are discussed 
      in the context of these findings.

AB  - Auditory temporal processing deficits have been proposed as the underlying cause 
      of phonological difficulties in Developmental Dyslexia. The hypothesis was tested
      in a sample of 20 Italian dyslexic children aged 8-14, and 20 matched control
      children. Three tasks of auditory processing of non-verbal stimuli, involving
      discrimination and reproduction of sequences of rapidly presented short sounds
      were expressly created. Dyslexic subjects performed more poorly than control
      children, suggesting the presence of a deficit only partially influenced by the
      duration of the stimuli and of inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs).

      connectivity.
PG  - 21-9
LID - 10.1007/s10803-009-0817-1 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies provide credence to the minicolumnar origin of several
      developmental conditions, including dyslexia. Characteristics of
      minicolumnopathies include abnormalities in how the cortex expands and folds.
      This study examines the depth of the gyral white matter measured in an MRI series
      of 15 dyslexic adult men and eleven age-matched comparison subjects. Measurements
      were based upon the 3D Euclidean distance map inside the segmented cerebral white
      matter surface. Mean gyral white matter depth was 3.05 mm (SD +/- 0.30 mm) in
      dyslexic subjects and 1.63 mm (SD +/- 0.15 mm) in the controls. The results add
      credence to the growing literature suggesting that the attained reading circuit
      in dyslexia is abnormal because it is inefficient. Otherwise the anatomical
      substratum (i.e., corticocortical connectivity) underlying this inefficient
      circuit is normal. A deficit in very short-range connectivity (e.g., angular
      gyrus, striate cortex), consistent with results of a larger gyral window, could
      help explain reading difficulties in patients with dyslexia. The structural
      findings hereby reported are diametrically opposed to those reported for autism.

AB  - Difficulties in phonological processing and reading that characterize
      developmental dyslexia have been suggested also to affect those with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, it is not known to what
      extent various intervening factors, such as low intelligence quotient or age,
      explain the observed difficulties. In this study, the authors investigated the
      domains of phonological processing, reading, spelling, and arithmetic in 110
      adults (ages 18-55 years) in healthy control, dyslexia, and ADHD groups.The aim
      of the study was specifically to compare domain profiles of participants with
      ADHD to those in other groups.The results showed that participants with dyslexia 
      had the most generalized difficulties. Participants with ADHD were the least
      affected, and their difficulties reflected less accurate performance.
      Furthermore, all the observed differences became nonsignificant when intelligence
      quotient was controlled for. This suggests that adult ADHD is not related to
      significant impairments in phonological processing or achievement.

PG  - 59-62
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.08.003 [doi]
AB  - There is a continuum of cognitive styles amongst humans, defined by differences
      in minicolumnar numbers/width and arcuate/commissural white matter
      connectivities. Specifically, it is the connectivity within and between modular
      cortical circuits that defines conditions such as autism and developmental
      dyslexia. In autism, a model of local hyperconnectivity and long-range
      hypoconnectivity explains many of the behavioral and cognitive traits present in 
      the condition, while the inverse arrangement of local hypoconnectivity and
      long-range hyperconnectivity in dyslexia sheds light on that condition as well.
      We propose that the cognitive styles present in autism and developmental dyslexia
      typify the extremes of a minicolumnar spectrum in humans.

      dyslexia.
PG  - 93-101
LID - 10.1177/0956797609354084 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading in
      individuals who otherwise possess the intelligence and motivation considered
      necessary for fluent reading, and who also have had reasonable reading
      instruction. Identifying factors associated with normative and impaired reading
      development has implications for diagnosis, intervention, and prevention. We show
      that in typical readers, reading and IQ development are dynamically linked over
      time. Such mutual interrelationships are not perceptible in dyslexic readers,
      which suggests that reading and cognition develop more independently in these
      individuals. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first empirical
      demonstration of a coupling between cognition and reading in typical readers and 
      a developmental uncoupling between cognition and reading in dyslexic readers.
      This uncoupling was the core concept of the initial description of dyslexia and
      remains the focus of the current definitional model of this learning disability.

      dyslexia.
PG  - 132-47
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.07.037 [doi]
AB  - Among the hypotheses relating dyslexia to a temporal processing disorder, Hari
      and Renvall (Hari, R., Renvall, H., 2001. Impaired processing of rapid stimulus
      sequences in dyslexia. Trends. Cognit. Sci. 5, 525-532.) argued that dyslexic
      individuals would show difficulties at an attentional level, through sluggish
      attentional shifting (SAS) in all sensory modalities. However, the amodality
      assumption of the SAS theory was never straightforwardly assessed in the same
      group of dyslexic participants using similar paradigms in both the visual and
      auditory modalities. Here, the attentional sequential performance of control and 
      dyslexic participants was evaluated using rapid serial presentation paradigms
      measuring individual stream segregation thresholds in the two modalities. The
      first experiment conducted on French dyslexic children with a phonological
      disorder revealed an SAS only in the auditory modality only which was strongly
      related to reading performance. The second experiment carried out on British
      dyslexic young adults with a phonological disorder using the same auditory
      segregation task but a different visual paradigm revealed an SAS in both the
      visual and the auditory modalities. In addition, a relationship was found in this
      group between SAS, poor reading and poor phonological skills. Two further control
      experiments showed that differences in task design or participants' language
      between Experiments 1 and 2 could not account for the differences in terms of
      visual segregation patterns. Overall, our results support the view that the
      auditory SAS plays a role in developmental dyslexia via its impact on
      phonological abilities. In addition, a visual temporal disorder in dyslexia might
      emerge at a later developmental stage, when the visual system normally becomes
      more expert at rapid temporal processing.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of syntactic complexity on written sentence
      comprehension in compensated adults with dyslexia. Because working memory (WM)
      plays a key role in processing complex sentences, and individuals with dyslexia
      often demonstrate persistent deficits in WM, we hypothesized that individuals
      with dyslexia would perform more poorly on tasks designed to assess the
      comprehension of syntactic structures that are especially taxing on WM (e.g.,
      passives, sentences with relative clauses). Compared to their nondyslexic peers, 
      individuals with dyslexia were significantly less accurate and marginally slower 
      on passive sentences. For sentences containing relative clauses, the dyslexic
      group was also less accurate but did not differ in response times. Covarying WM
      and word reading in both analyses eliminated group differences showing that
      syntactic deficits in adults with dyslexia are constrained by both WM and
      word-reading ability. These findings support previous research showing that
      syntactic processing deficits are characteristic of dyslexia, even among
      high-achieving students.

LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2009.09.002 [doi]
AB  - Previous research suggests a relationship between spatial attention and
      phonological decoding in developmental dyslexia. The aim of this study was to
      examine differences between good and poor phonological decoders in the allocation
      of spatial attention to global and local levels of hierarchical stimuli. A
      further aim was to investigate the relationship between global/local processing
      and electrophysiological indices (N1, N2) of spatial attention in these groups.
      Good (n=18) and poor (n=16) phonological decoders were selected on the basis of
      non-word reading ability. Participants responded to either the global or local
      level of hierarchical stimuli presented in the left or right visual field in a
      sustained attention task. Poor phonological decoders showed slower RT relative to
      good phonological decoders regardless of whether attention was directed to either
      global or local processing levels. This was accompanied by a lack of task-related
      modulation of the posterior N1 and N2 Event-Related Potential (ERP) components,
      suggesting differences in the early allocation of spatial attention and later
      perceptual processing respectively. Poor decoders also showed greater N2
      amplitude overall, suggestive of compensatory processing at later perceptual
      stages. There was preliminary evidence for sex differences in hemispheric
      lateralisation, with a reversal of hemispheric lateralisation observed among male
      and female poor phonological decoders. These findings have important implications
      for the understanding of the relationship between spatial attention and
      phonological decoding in developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 705-23
LID - 10.1080/02643291003691106 [doi]
AB  - The present study examined whether equivalents of surface and phonological
      subtypes of developmental dyslexia could be found among a sample of 84 poor
      readers aged 9-12 years in Greece. Word reading latency was used as a measure of 
      lexical skill, and nonword reading accuracy was used as a measure of nonlexical
      skill. A simple regression of word reading latencies on nonword reading accuracy 
      scores was performed for 42 developing readers. A total of 2 poor readers with
      accurate nonword reading plus slow word reading relative to controls (equivalents
      of surface dyslexia) and 2 poor readers with inaccurate nonword reading plus fast
      accurate word reading relative to controls (equivalents of phonological dyslexia)
      were identified from amongst the sample of poor readers. Further testing of these
      4 cases on measures of irregular-word and nonword spelling revealed additional
      evidence of a dissociation between lexical and nonlexical impairments. These
      results support the notion that dual-route models can be used to explore
      individual differences among dyslexic readers in transparent orthographic systems
      such as Greek. An attempt is also made to interpret the results in terms of a
      double deficit theory of dyslexia.

TI  - Subtypes of developmental dyslexia in transparent orthographies: a comment on
      Lachmann and Van Leeuwen (2008).
PG  - 752-8
LID - 10.1080/02643290903526289 [doi]
AB  - Lachmann and Van Leeuwen (2008) proposed two diagnostic subtypes of developmental
      dyslexia in a language with transparent orthography (German). The classification 
      was based on reading time, rather than reading errors, for lists of words and
      nonwords. The two subtypes were "frequent-word reading impaired" (FWRI) and
      "nonword reading impaired" (NWRI). Notably, FWRI were very slow in reading
      high-frequency words but as fast as controls in reading nonwords; ca. one-third
      of these children showed this "reversed lexicality effect" in a particularly
      marked fashion (i.e., read nonwords two to three times faster than high-frequency
      words). Since Italian is a highly transparent language, we applied this
      classification to 87 third- and sixth-grade dyslexics from various previously
      published studies. Some children showed a marked lexicality effect, while others 
      showed small or no difference between word and nonword reading speed. However,
      regardless of stimulus length, grade and presence/absence of a previous language 
      delay, no child showed a marked reversed lexicality effect; more generally, no
      child could be classified as FWRI. These findings indicate that the search for
      subtypes of developmental dyslexia in transparent orthographies still constitutes
      an open question.

TI  - Different letter-processing strategies in diagnostic subgroups of developmental
      dyslexia also occur in a transparent orthography: reply to a commentary by
      Spinelli et al.
PG  - 759-68
LID - 10.1080/02643291003737065 [doi]
AB  - The article was motivated by a commentary of Spinelli et al. (2010) , who
      commented on our experimental study with dyslexic children (Lachmann & van
      Leeuwen, 2008). They questioned the unusually large reversed lexicality effect we
      reported for three of our dyslexic children for which word reading times were
      considerably longer than nonword reading times. We argued that, in principle, in 
      a transparent orthography, such as German, children exist who have significant
      problems in word reading, but for whom nonword reading is normal. The extreme
      reversed lexically effect, however, may not be representative for the dyslexic
      population. Since we do not want to give the impression that our results were
      based on these three participants, we reran analyses on reaction times presented 
      in Lachmann and van Leeuwen, this time excluding the data from the three
      individuals. Results were replicated. The constructive criticism has helped put
      both the diagnostics and our experimental results on even firmer ground. Both
      yield a consistent interpretation, in which two subgroups of dyslexics can be
      distinguished: one with generic activation problems; the other with a specific
      problem in phoneme-grapheme conversion.

      processing disorder].
PG  - 1285-90
LID - 10.1007/s00106-009-1911-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is a controversial issue whether sequential processing in children
      with auditory processing disorders (APD) is a unimodal auditory impairment.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Normal achieving controls (n=12; mean age: 101.1 months; SD
      20.3) and children referred to clinical facilities for assessment including
      children with monosymptomatic APD (n=25; mean age: 90.8 months; SD 9.8), children
      with developmental language disorder (DLD]) + APD (n=11; mean age: 89.5 months;
      SD 14.9), children with dyslexia + APD (n=10; mean age: 113.8 months; SD 17.1)
      were compared using the subtest digit recall of the German version of the K-ABC
      (Melchers & Preuss 2001) and the K-ABC subtest hand movements in the visual
      modality. RESULTS: On average all groups tended to perform alike in visual
      sequential processing and memory (T-score>50). Normal controls (non-APD) showed
      on average the best test performance (T-score 57.4; SD 10.5), but the mean
      performance did not differ significantly from children with APD. All groups also 
      presented on average normal test performance in the auditory modality however,
      children of the clinical groups were below the age mean (DLD + APD: T-W 43.1; SD 
      6.8; monosymptomatic APD: T-W 45.8; SD 9.8; dyslexia + APD: 46.7; SD5.8).
      Children with DLD + APD and those with monosymptomatic APD exhibited a
      significantly lower but not poor performance in auditory processing of sequences 
      compared to their performance in visual sequential processing. The results of
      auditory and visual processing of sequences were significantly correlated in the 
      clinical groups DLD + APD (0.58) and monosymptomatic APD (0.34), but not in the
      smallest group dyslexia + APD (0.48) and in normal achieving controls (0.32).
      CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results of the present study it may be concluded 
      that a normal test performance on visual measure does not exclude a bimodal or
      pansensory seriation disorder in children with APD. It does, however, indicate
      the existence of a primary auditory sequential processing deficit, because at
      least the processing of phonological and visual stimuli was not separately
      carried out in children with DLD + APD.

TI  - Differential effects of atomoxetine on executive functioning and lexical decision
      in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and reading disorder.
PG  - 699-707
LID - 10.1089/cap.2009.0029 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of a promising pharmacological treatment for
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), atomoxetine, were studied on
      executive functions in both ADHD and reading disorder (RD) because earlier
      research demonstrated an overlap in executive functioning deficits in both
      disorders. In addition, the effects of atomoxetine were explored on lexical
      decision. METHODS: Sixteen children with ADHD, 20 children with ADHD + RD, 21
      children with RD, and 26 normal controls were enrolled in a randomized
      placebo-controlled crossover study. Children were measured on visuospatial
      working memory, inhibition, and lexical decision on the day of randomization and 
      following two 28-day medication periods. RESULTS: Children with ADHD + RD showed 
      improved visuospatial working memory performance and, to a lesser extent,
      improved inhibition following atomoxetine treatment compared to placebo. No
      differential effects of atomoxetine were found for lexical decision in comparison
      to placebo. In addition, no effects of atomoxetine were demonstrated in the ADHD 
      and RD groups. CONCLUSION: Atomoxetine improved visuospatial working memory and
      to a lesser degree inhibition in children with ADHD + RD, which suggests
      differential developmental pathways for co-morbid ADHD + RD as compared to ADHD
      and RD alone. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: B4Z-MC-LYCK, NCT00191906;

AB  - We analyzed genetic linkage and association of measures of language, speech and
      reading phenotypes to candidate regions in a single set of families ascertained
      for SLI. Sib-pair and family-based analyses were carried out for candidate gene
      loci for Reading Disability (RD) on chromosomes 1p36, 3p12-q13, 6p22, and 15q21, 
      and the speech-language candidate region on 7q31 in a sample of 322 participants 
      ascertained for Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Replication or suggestive
      replication of linkage was obtained in all of these regions, but the evidence
      suggests that the genetic influences may not be identical for the three domains. 
      In particular, linkage analysis replicated the influence of genes on chromosome
      6p for all three domains, but association analysis indicated that only one of the
      candidate genes for reading disability, KIAA0319, had a strong effect on language
      phenotypes. The findings are consistent with a multiple gene model of the
      comorbidity between language impairments and reading disability and have
      implications for neurocognitive developmental models and maturational processes.

      speech in noise: implications for developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 311-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuron.2009.10.006 [doi]
AB  - We examined context-dependent encoding of speech in children with and without
      developmental dyslexia by measuring auditory brainstem responses to a speech
      syllable presented in a repetitive or variable context. Typically developing
      children showed enhanced brainstem representation of features related to voice
      pitch in the repetitive context, relative to the variable context. In contrast,
      children with developmental dyslexia exhibited impairment in their ability to
      modify representation in predictable contexts. From a functional perspective, we 
      found that the extent of context-dependent encoding in the auditory brainstem
      correlated positively with behavioral indices of speech perception in noise. The 
      ability to sharpen representation of repeating elements is crucial to speech
      perception in noise, since it allows superior "tagging" of voice pitch, an
      important cue for segregating sound streams in background noise. The disruption
      of this mechanism contributes to a critical deficit in noise-exclusion, a
      hallmark symptom in developmental dyslexia.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the types of difficulty encountered by children
      with nonverbal (visuospatial) learning disabilities (NLD) during the processing
      of spatial information derived from descriptions. Two spatial descriptions--one
      in survey, one in route perspective--and one nonspatial description were orally
      presented to children aged 9-12 divided in three groups: (i) with NLD (N=12),
      (ii) with reading disability (RD) (N=11), and (iii) without learning disabilities
      who served as controls (N=16). Children performed two tasks: sentence
      verification and location. In the verification task, NLD performed worse in
      survey text than control and RD groups. Moreover, in the location task NLD were
      worse than controls in both survey and route descriptions, but significantly
      poorer than the RD group only in the survey description. The results are
      discussed considering their implications in understanding the neuropsychological 
      profile of NLD and the processes involved by different types of spatial
      descriptions.

PG  - 582-604
LID - 10.1080/09297040902927614 [doi]
AB  - Language delay is a frequent antecedent of literacy problems, and both may be
      linked to phonological impairment. Studies on developmental dyslexia have led to 
      contradictory results due to the heterogeneity of the pathological samples. The
      present study investigated whether Italian children with dyslexia showed
      selective phonological processing deficits or more widespread linguistic
      impairment and whether these deficits were associated with previous language
      delay. We chose 46 children with specific reading deficits and divided them into 
      two groups based on whether they had language delay (LD) or not (NoLD). LD and
      NoLD children showed similar, severe deficits in reading and spelling decoding,
      but only LD children showed a moderate impairment in reading comprehension. LD
      children were more impaired in phonological working memory and phonological
      fluency, as well as in semantic fluency, grammatical comprehension, and verbal
      IQ. These findings indicate the presence of a moderate but widespread linguistic 
      deficit (not limited to phonological processing) in a subset of dyslexic children
      with previous language delay that does not generalize to all children with
      reading difficulties.

AB  - At the end of first grade, TM did not know the alphabet and could read no words. 
      He could not tap syllables in words, had difficulty producing rhyming words and
      retrieving the phonological representations of words, and he could not
      discriminate many phoneme contrasts. He learned letter-sound correspondences
      first for single-consonant onsets and then later for the final consonant in a
      word but had difficulty with letter-sound associations for vowels. TM's ability
      to select a printed word to match a spoken word on the basis of the initial or
      final letter and sound was interpreted as evidence of Ehri's phonetic-cue
      reading. Using the Glass Analysis method, the authors taught TM to read and he
      became an independent reader. We discuss how his phonological processing deficits
      contributed to his reading difficulties.

TI  - Changes in reading strategies in school-age children.
PG  - 441-53
AB  - Learning to read is one of the most important cognitive milestones in the human
      social environment. One of the most accepted models explaining such process is
      the Double-Route Cascaded Model. It suggests the existence of two reading
      strategies: lexical and sublexical. In the Spanish language there are some
      contradictions about how these strategies are applied for reading. In addition,
      there are only a few studies dealing with the analysis of shifts between them,
      achieving a fluent reading process. In this paper we use a reading task including
      words and pseudowords for characterizing the cost of shifting between reading
      strategies in children with developmental dyslexia and normal controls. Our
      results suggest the presence of both strategies in these two experimental groups.
      In controls, both strategies become more efficient in correspondence to the
      increased exposition to written material. However, in children with developmental
      dyslexia only the lexical strategy exhibits such improvement. Their also point to
      a low cost for shifting between strategies in controls and a much more
      significant one in children with developmental dyslexia, differentiating
      subgroups with distinct shifting patterns.

PG  - 513-23
LID - 10.1024/1422-4917.37.6.513 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Deficits in auditory short-term memory are thought to underlie
      developmental language disorders and dyslexia. There is, however, a lack of
      systematic studies of short-term memory in children at a young age. The aim of
      this study was to probe the duration of auditory sensory memory using objective
      methods in young children. METHOD: 37 two-year-old and 52 six-year-old normally
      developing children were included in the study. Event-related potentials (ERPs)
      were elicited in a passive auditory oddball paradigm with variable interstimulus 
      intervals (ISIs of 0.5-5 s, depending on the subgroup). RESULTS: For shorter
      ISIs, a prominent mismatch negativity (MMN) and late discriminative negativity
      (LDN) were found, while a distinct P3a occurred particularly for longer ISIs.
      Statistical significance was proven for the dependence of MMN and LDN amplitudes 
      on the ISI. The change in the structure of the ERP components occurred at a
      longer ISI for the six-year-olds than for the 2-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: The
      points where MMN and LDN disappear with increasing ISI suggest that the duration 
      of auditory sensory memory lies between 1 and 2 s in two-year-old children and
      between 3 and 5 s in six-year-olds. The occurrence of a P3a beyond the point
      where MMN and LDN can no longer be elicited, however, provides evidence that
      several different mechanisms with different durations of memory representations
      are involved in short-term storage of auditory information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Referring to the prevalence rates of learning disorders in the
      research literature, the numbers of mathematics disorder and reading/spelling
      disorder are often reported to be identical. However, the correlation between
      intelligence level and reading/spelling skills is much weaker than between
      intelligence and arithmetic skills. If the same definition criterion is applied
      to both disorders, a lower prevalence rate for mathematics disorder should be
      expected. OBJECTIVE: Are there differences in the prevalence estimates for
      learning disorders depending on the definition criterion? METHOD: A large
      representative sample of German students (N=1970) was used to review the
      hypothesis. RESULTS: Depending on the definition criterion, we could show a
      prevalence range of mathematics disorder between 0.1% and 8.1% in the same
      sample. Using the same definition criterion for both learning disorders, there
      are two to three times as many students with reading/spelling disorder than those
      with mathematics disorder. DISCUSSION: Whenever children with reading/spelling
      disorder are compared to children with mathematics disorder, the same definition 
      criterion has to be applied.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the co-existence of visuospatial and
      phonological disorders in Chinese children.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a neurological condition that is characterized by
      severe impairment in reading skill acquisition in people with adequate
      intelligence and typical schooling. For English readers, reading impairment is
      critically associated with a phonological processing disorder, which may co-occur
      with an orthographic (visual word form) processing deficit, but not with a
      general visual processing dysfunction in most dyslexics. The pathophysiology of
      dyslexia varies across languages: for instance, unlike English, written Chinese
      maps visually intricate graphic forms (characters) onto meanings; pronunciation
      of Chinese characters must be rote memorized. This suggests that, in Chinese, a
      fine-grained visuospatial analysis must be performed to activate characters'
      phonology and meaning; consequently, disordered phonological processing may
      commonly co-exist with abnormal visuospatial processing in Chinese dyslexia. To
      test this hypothesis, we conducted an fMRI experiment in which 12 Chinese
      dyslexics, shown previously to exhibit a phonological disorder, performed a
      physical size judgment measuring visuospatial dimensions. Compared with 12
      control subjects, the dyslexics showed weaker activations in left intraparietal
      sulcus (IPS) mediating visuospatial processing. Analyses of individual dyslexics'
      performances further suggest that developmental dyslexia in Chinese is commonly
      associated with the co-existence of a visuospatial deficit and a phonological
      disorder.

      dyslexia demonstrated using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound.
PG  - 61-5
LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2009.05.002 [doi]
AB  - Functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) is a relatively new and
      non-invasive technique that assesses cerebral lateralisation through measurements
      of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries. In this study fTCD was
      used to compare functional asymmetry during a word generation task between a
      group of 30 dyslexic adults and a group of 30 non-dyslexic individuals. In light 
      of previous evidence of atypical laterality in dyslexia, a reduced leftward
      asymmetry was predicted and confirmed. We know from previous research that most
      people with atypical language lateralisation have normal language and literacy
      skills: nevertheless, our results confirm that language laterality is reduced in 
      those with dyslexia. Theoretical explanations for this apparent conundrum are
      discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article proposes a method to automatically identify and label
      event-related potential (ERP) components with high accuracy and precision.
      METHODS: We present a framework, referred to as peak-picking Dynamic Time Warping
      (ppDTW), where a priori knowledge about the ERPs under investigation is used to
      define a reference signal. We developed a combination of peak-picking and Dynamic
      Time Warping (DTW) that makes the temporal intervals for peak-picking adaptive on
      the basis of the morphology of the data. We tested the procedure on experimental 
      data recorded from a control group and from children diagnosed with developmental
      dyslexia. RESULTS: We compared our results with the traditional peak-picking. We 
      demonstrated that our method achieves better performance than peak-picking, with 
      an overall precision, recall and F-score of 93%, 86% and 89%, respectively,
      versus 93%, 80% and 85% achieved by peak-picking. CONCLUSION: We showed that our 
      hybrid method outperforms peak-picking, when dealing with data involving several 
      peaks of interest. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method can reliably identify and
      label ERP components in challenging event-related recordings, thus assisting the 
      clinician in an objective assessment of amplitudes and latencies of peaks of
      clinical interest.

TI  - Predicting children's speech, language and reading impairment over time.
PG  - 341-343
AB  - Prospective population based longitudinal studies are highly informative for
      understanding developmental trajectories in speech, language and reading
      impairment. These studies contribute to our knowledge about the onset and
      trajectories of these disorders and to our understanding of the factors that
      influence these trajectories over the life course. Epidemiological research in
      speech, language and reading impairment shares some of the challenges inherent in
      studying any developmental impairment that persists yet changes over time. Not
      only do the speech, language and reading impairment phenotypes change over time
      but the proximal and distal factors associated with these phenotypes vary in
      magnitude at different epochs in development. The notion that phenotypes and the 
      factors that influences them change is a positive one because it allows for the
      possibility of improvement and recovery. Clearly, the phenomenology of these
      developmental disorders makes the practical enterprise of identifying children at
      risk for these disorders and predicting their outcomes a significant challenge.

TI  - Neural correlates of developmental coordination disorder: a review of hypotheses.
PG  - 1273-81
LID - 10.1177/0883073809333537 [doi]
AB  - Affecting 5% to 6% of school-age children, developmental coordination disorder is
      characterized by a marked impairment of motor coordination that significantly
      interferes with activities of daily living and academic achievement. Little is
      known about the etiology of developmental coordination disorder, but the disorder
      often coexists with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
      speech/language impairment, and/or reading disability. This comprehensive review 
      examines the literature supporting or refuting hypothesized neural correlates of 
      developmental coordination disorder and suggests directions for future research. 
      Potential sources of neuropathology include the cerebellum, parietal lobe, corpus
      callosum, and basal ganglia. Comorbidities and deficits associated with
      developmental coordination disorder are highly suggestive of cerebellar
      dysfunction; yet, given the heterogeneity of this disorder, it is likely that the
      cerebellum is not the only neural correlate. Neuroimaging studies and behavioral 
      investigations of learning-related change in motor behavior are the next critical
      step in enhancing our understanding of developmental coordination disorder.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmpt.2009.08.015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study presents a case series of 157 children with developmental
      delay syndromes, including the conditions such as dyspraxia, dyslexia,
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and learning disabilities who received 
      chiropractic care. CLINICAL FEATURES: A consecutive sample of 157 children aged 6
      to 13 years (86 boys and 71 girls) with difficulties in reading, learning, social
      interaction, and school performance who met these inclusion criteria were
      included. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: Each patient received a multimodal
      chiropractic treatment protocol, applied kinesiology chiropractic technique. The 
      outcome measures were a series of 8 standardized psychometric tests given to the 
      children by a certified speech therapist pre- and posttreatment, which evaluate
      20 separate areas of cognitive function, including patient- or parent-reported
      improvements in school performance, social interaction, and sporting activities. 
      Individual and group data showed that at the end of treatment, the 157 children
      showed improvements in the 8 psychometric tests and 20 areas of cognitive
      function compared with their values before treatment. Their ability to
      concentrate, maintain focus and attention, and control impulsivity and their
      performance at home and school improved. CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that a
      multimodal chiropractic method that assesses and treats motor dysfunction reduced
      symptoms and enhanced the cognitive performance in this group of children.

PG  - 569-71
LID - 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.05.034 [doi]
AB  - The present article hints at a curious neurocognitive phenomenon of development
      of artistic talents in some children with dyslexia. The article also takes note
      of the phenomenon of creating in the midst of language disability as observed in 
      the lives of such creative people like Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein who 
      were most probably affected with developmental learning disorders. It has been
      hypothesised that a developmental delay in the dominant hemisphere most likely
      'disinhibits' the non-dominant parietal lobe to unmask talents, artistic or
      otherwise, in some such individuals. The present hypothesis follows the
      phenomenon of paradoxical functional facilitation described earlier. It has been 
      suggested that children with learning disorders be encouraged to develop such
      hidden talents to full capacity, rather than be subjected to overemphasising on
      the correction of the disturbed coded symbol operations, in remedial training.

TI  - Children with dyslexia lack multiple specializations along the visual word-form
      (VWF) system.
PG  - 1940-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.021 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia has been associated with a dysfunction of a brain region
      in the left inferior occipitotemporal cortex, called the "visual word-form area" 
      (VWFA). In adult normal readers, the VWFA is specialized for print processing and
      sensitive to the orthographic familiarity of letter strings. However, it is still
      unclear whether these two levels of occipitotemporal specialization are affected 
      in developmental dyslexia. Specifically, we investigated whether (a) these two
      levels of specialization are impaired in dyslexic children with only a few years 
      of reading experience and (b) whether this impairment is confined to the left
      inferior occipitotemporal VWFA, or extends to adjacent regions of the
      "VWF-system" with its posterior-anterior gradient of print specialization. Using 
      fMRI, we measured brain activity in 18 dyslexic and 24 age-matched control
      children (age 9.7-12.5 years) while they indicated if visual stimuli (real words,
      pseudohomophones, pseudowords and false-fonts) sounded like a real word. Five
      adjacent regions of interest (ROIs) in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex
      covered the full anterior-posterior extent of the VWF-system. We found that
      control and dyslexic children activated the same main areas within the reading
      network. However, a gradient of print specificity (higher anterior activity to
      letter strings but higher posterior activity to false-fonts) as well as a
      constant sensitivity to orthographic familiarity (higher activity for unfamiliar 
      than familiar word-forms) along the VWF-system could only be detected in
      controls. In conclusion, analyzing responses and specialization profiles along
      the left VWF-system reveals that children with dyslexia show impaired
      specialization for both print and orthography.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a highly prevalent and specific disorder of reading
      acquisition characterised by impaired reading fluency and comprehension. We have 
      previously identified fMRI- and ERP-based neural markers of impaired sentence
      reading in dyslexia that indicated both deviant basic word processing and deviant
      semantic incongruency processing. However, it remained unclear how specific these
      impairments are for dyslexia, as they occurred when children with dyslexia (DYS) 
      were compared to chronological age-matched controls (CA) who also differ in the
      amount of reading experience. Adding a younger control group at a similar reading
      level (RL) as the dyslexic group, we examined here which of these markers would
      be specific for dyslexia despite matched performance, and which would resemble a 
      developmental delay. Both the RL group and the DYS group showed a similar
      reversal of incongruency effects in the inferior parietal region (fMRI data) and 
      similarly reduced incongruency effects around 400 ms (ERP data) compared to the
      CA group, suggesting that the semantic impairment in dyslexia resembles a
      developmental delay. Furthermore, the DYS group showed reduced sentence
      reading-related activation in the inferior parietal cortex in the fMRI data, and 
      at around 100 ms (trend) and 400 ms in the ERP data when compared to both CA and 
      RL groups, suggesting dyslexia-specific deficits in basic word processing during 
      sentence reading. Low reading skills due to young age and due to
      dyslexia-specific word processing deficits thus reflect different pathways which 
      impair semantic processing in similar ways.

PG  - 1333-40
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze sleep architecture of children with dyslexia, by
      means of conventional parameters and EEG spectral analysis and to correlate sleep
      parameters and EEG spectra with neuropsychological measures. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional study involving validated sleep questionnaires,
      neuropsychological scales, and polysomnographic recordings. SETTING: Sleep
      laboratory in academic center. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen subjects with developmental 
      dyslexia (mean age 10.8 years) and 11 normally reading children (mean age 10.1
      years). All the subjects underwent overnight polysomnographic recording; EEG
      power spectra were computed from the Cz derivation and spindle density was
      calculated during sleep stages N2. INTERVENTION: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      Dyslexic children showed an increase in power of frequency bands between 0.5-3 Hz
      and 11-12 Hz in stage N2 and between 0.5-1 Hz in stage N3; they also showed
      significantly increased spindle density during N2. The power of the sigma band in
      N2 was positively correlated with the Word reading and MT reading tests;
      similarly, spindle density was significantly correlated with the Word reading
      test. The increased spindle activity and EEG sigma power in dyslexic subjects
      were found to be correlated with the degree of dyslexic impairment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The correlation found between sleep spindle activity and reading abilities in
      developmental dyslexia supports the hypothesis of a role for NREM sleep and
      spindles in sleep-related neurocognitive processing.

TI  - Cognitive demands impair postural control in developmental dyslexia: a negative
      effect that can be compensated.
PG  - 125-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.06.093 [doi]
AB  - Children with developmental dyslexia exhibit delayed reading abilities and
      various sensori-motor deficits. The way these various symptoms interact remain
      poorly understood. The objective of this study was twofold. First, we aimed to
      investigate whether postural control was impaired in dyslexic children when
      cognitive demands are increased. Second, we checked whether this effect could be 
      reduced significantly by a treatment aiming to recalibrate ocular proprioception.
      Twelve dyslexic and fifteen treated dyslexic children (>3 months of treatment)
      were compared with twelve non-dyslexic children in two conditions (mean age:
      11.6+/-2.1, 12.5+/-1.5 and 10.6+/-1.7 years respectively). In a first condition
      they maintained balance while fixating a point in front of them. In the second
      condition the postural task was combined with a silently reading one. Balance was
      assessed by means of a force plate. Results demonstrated that the mean velocity
      (i.e. the total length) of the center of pressure (CoP) displacement was
      increased in the reading task only for the dyslexic group. Interestingly, for the
      treated children, an inverse tendency was observed: the mean velocity (i.e. the
      total length) and the surface of the 90% confidence ellipse of the CoP
      displacement decreased for 13/15 patients and for 12/15 patients respectively,
      while performing the reading task. Values remained similar to those observed for 
      the control children. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that cognitive
      demands can impair postural control in developmental dyslexia but this
      interaction could be normalized. These results sustain the hypothesis of a
      cerebellar origin for dyslexia.

      developmental dyslexia theories.
PG  - 555-63
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acp044 [doi]
AB  - Temporal processing deficit could be associated with a specific difficulty in
      learning to read. In 1951, Stambak provided preliminary evidence that children
      with dyslexia performed less well than good readers in reproduction of 21
      rhythmic patterns. Stambak's task was administered to 1,028 French children aged 
      5-6 years. The score distribution (from 0 to 21) was quasi-normal, with some
      children failing completely and other performing perfectly. In second grade,
      reading was assessed in 695 of these children. Kindergarten variables explained
      26% of the variance of the reading score at second grade. The Stambak score was
      strongly and linearly related to reading performance in second grade, after
      partialling out performance on other tasks (oral repetition, attention, and
      visuo-spatial tasks) and socio-cultural level. Findings are discussed in relation
      to perceptual, cerebellar, intermodal, and attention-related theories of
      developmental dyslexia. It is concluded that simple rhythm reproduction tasks in 
      kindergarten are predictive of later reading performance.

TI  - There are multiple contributors to the verbal short-term memory deficit in
      children with developmental reading disabilities.
PG  - 485-506
LID - 10.1080/09297040902748218 [doi]
AB  - Prior research has put forth at least four possible contributors to the verbal
      short-term memory (VSTM) deficit in children with developmental reading
      disabilities (RD): poor phonological awareness that affects phonological coding
      into VSTM, a less effective phonological store, slow articulation rate, and
      fewer/poorer quality long-term memory (LTM) representations. This project is
      among the first to test the four suppositions in one study. Participants included
      18 children with RD and 18 controls. VSTM was assessed using Baddeley's model of 
      the phonological loop. Findings suggest all four suppositions are correct,
      depending upon the type of material utilized. Children with RD performed
      comparably to controls in VSTM for common words but worse for less frequent words
      and nonwords. Furthermore, only articulation rate predicted VSTM for common
      words, whereas Verbal IQ and articulation rate predicted VSTM for less frequent
      words, and phonological awareness and articulation rate predicted VSTM for
      nonwords. Overall, findings suggest that the mechanism(s) used to code and store 
      items by their meaning is intact in RD, and the deficit in VSTM for less frequent
      words may be a result of fewer/poorer quality LTM representations for these
      words. In contrast, phonological awareness and the phonological store are
      impaired, affecting VSTM for items that are coded phonetically. Slow articulation
      rate likely affects VSTM for most material when present. When assessing reading
      performance, VSTM predicted decoding skill but not word identification after
      controlling Verbal IQ and phonological awareness. Thus, VSTM likely contributes
      to reading ability when words are novel and must be decoded.

AB  - We examined categorical speech perception in school-age children with
      developmental dyslexia or Specific Language Impairment (SLI), compared to
      age-matched and younger controls. Stimuli consisted of synthetic speech tokens in
      which place of articulation varied from 'b' to 'd'. Children were tested on
      categorization, categorization in noise, and discrimination. Phonological
      awareness skills were also assessed to examine whether these correlated with
      speech perception measures. We observed similarly good baseline categorization
      rates across all groups; however, when noise was added, the SLI group showed
      impaired categorization relative to controls, whereas dyslexic children showed an
      intact profile. The SLI group showed poorer than expected between-category
      discrimination rates, whereas this pattern was only marginal in the dyslexic
      group. Impaired phonological awareness profiles were observed in both the SLI and
      dyslexic groups; however, correlations between phonological awareness and speech 
      perception scores were not significant. The results of the study suggest that in 
      children with language and reading impairments, there is a significant
      relationship between receptive language and speech perception, there is at best a
      weak relationship between reading and speech perception, and indeed the
      relationship between phonological and speech perception deficits is highly
      complex.

      than voicing or manner-of-articulation. Speech-perception-in-noise deficits
      persisted when performance of dyslexics was compared to that of much younger
      children matched on reading age, underscoring the fundamental nature of
      speech-perception-in-noise deficits. The deficits were not due to poor spectral
      or temporal resolution because dyslexics exhibited normal 'masking release'
      effects (i.e. better performance in fluctuating than in stationary noise).
      Moreover, speech-perception-in-noise predicted significant unique variance in
      reading even after controlling for low-level auditory, attentional, speech
      output, short-term memory and phonological awareness processes. Finally, the
      presence of external noise did not seem to be a necessary condition for speech
      perception deficits to occur because similar deficits were obtained when speech
      was degraded by eliminating temporal fine-structure cues without using external
      noise. In conclusion, the core deficit of dyslexics seems to be a lack of speech 
      robustness in the presence of external or internal noise.

TI  - Relationship between oculomotor scanning determined by the DEM test and a
      contextual reading test in schoolchildren with reading difficulties.
PG  - 1243-9
LID - 10.1007/s00417-009-1076-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between oculomotor scanning and reading in poor
      readers of primary school age is not well known. This study was designed to
      assess this relationship by determining mean Developmental Eye Movement (DEM)
      test times and reading speeds in a Spanish non-clinical population of children
      with poor reading skills but without dyslexia. METHODS: We conducted a
      cross-sectional study on 81 poor readers (8-11 years of age) in the third to
      fifth grades recruited from 11 elementary schools in Madrid, Spain. In each
      subject with best spectacle correction, oculomotor scanning was measured using
      the DEM test, and reading speed (words per minute) was assessed by a standardized
      Spanish contextual reading test. RESULTS: Mean horizontal DEM times were higher
      than normative values for children in the third, fourth and fifth grades, by 20
      seconds, 12 seconds, and 3 seconds respectively. Mean reading speeds were 18
      words per minute lower than the norm for the third and fourth grades
      respectively, and 30 words per minute lower than the norm for the fifth grade.
      Reading speeds were significantly related to horizontal DEM times (r = -0.53, p <
      0.0001). Thus, children showing a longer, or worse, horizontal DEM time achieved 
      lower reading speeds. CONCLUSIONS: Poor readers showed poor horizontal scanning
      as assessed by the DEM test that was related to a slow reading speed. This test
      should be used by optometric clinicians as a screening tool to help identify poor
      reading skills in school children at an early stage.

TI  - A novel role for DYX1C1, a chaperone protein for both Hsp70 and Hsp90, in breast 
      cancer.
PG  - 1265-76
LID - 10.1007/s00432-009-0568-6 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: With three consecutive tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs at its
      C-terminus essential for neuronal migration, and a p23 domain at its N-terminus, 
      DYX1C1 was the first gene proposed to have a role in developmental dyslexia. In
      this study, we attempted to identify the potential interaction of DYX1C1 and heat
      shock protein, and the role of DYX1C1 in breast cancer. MAIN METHODS: GST
      pull-down, a yeast two-hybrid system, RT-PCR, site-directed mutagenesis approach.
      KEY FINDINGS: Our study initially confirmed DYX1C1, a dyslexia related protein,
      could interact with Hsp70 and Hsp90 via GST pull-down and a yeast two-hybrid
      system. And we verified that EEVD, the C-terminal residues of DYX1C1, is
      responsible for the identified association. Further, DYX1C1 mRNA was
      significantly overexpressed in malignant breast tumor, linking with the
      up-regulated expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest
      that DYX1C1 is a novel Hsp70 and Hsp90-interacting co-chaperone protein and its
      expression is associated with malignancy.

TI  - Encephalopathic attacks in a family co-segregating myotonic dystrophy type 1, an 
      intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and early hearing loss.
PG  - 1029-35
LID - 10.1136/jnnp.2008.170126 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report new disease components in a unique myotonic dystrophy type 1
      (DM1) family previously described by us in which all affected members also had a 
      sensorimotor neuropathy that co-segregated with markers flanking the DM1 locus.
      METHODS: Clinical observations, electrophysiology, audiometry, DNA studies.
      RESULTS: During a follow-up period of over 25 years, the following were observed:
      (i) co-segregation of a striking new encephalopathic phenotype. In middle age,
      five patients were admitted on multiple occasions with attacks of impaired
      consciousness, psychomotor agitation, fever and, in about half of the cases,
      focal neurological signs, including unilateral weakness, sensory deficits and
      dysphasia. Reported onset phenomena consisted of confusion, headache, focal
      neurological symptoms and nausea; (ii) many patients show an early and severe
      sensorineural hearing loss; (iii) although they have mothers with the adult onset
      type, the four affected subjects from the youngest generation do not show any
      signs or symptoms of childhood or congenital myotonic dystrophy; (iv) the
      neuropathy meets the criteria of an intermediate type Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), 
      and is more severe in males; and (v) patients presented with an expanded fragment
      at the DM1 CTG repeat but this allele was refractory to PCR amplification and
      triplet repeat primed PCR at the 3' end of the array, indicating the existence of
      an additional lesion at the 3' end. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype in this unique
      family extends beyond myotonic dystrophy and CMT to include encephalopathic
      attacks and early hearing loss, and is associated with an atypical mutation at
      the DM1 locus.

AB  - Learning difficulties commonly comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders
      manifested by unexpected problems in some children's experiences in the academic 
      performance arena. These problems especially comprise of a variety of disorders, 
      which one of the most well-recognized learning difficulties is reading disability
      or dyslexia. The aim of this review is to explain the postmortem, structural or
      functional neuroimaging, and electrophysiological studies of human brains in
      children. The findings about these neuropathological and neurofunctional
      characteristics of developmental dyslexia, prospective studies beginning early in
      the life span and studies targeting remedial intervention will help to set the
      research agendas for future studies to follow.

TI  - Contribution of the anterior insula to temporal auditory processing deficits in
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 2401-11
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20674 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia has been assumed to arise from general auditory deficits, 
      compromising rapid temporal integration both of linguistic and nonlinguistic
      acoustic stimuli. Because the effort of auditory temporal processing of speech
      and nonspeech test materials may depend on presentation rate, fMRI measurements
      were performed in dyslexics and controls during passive listening to series of
      syllable and click sounds, using a parametric approach. Controls showed a
      decrease of hemodynamic brain activation within the right and an increase within 
      the left anterior insula as a function of the presentation rate both of click as 
      well as syllable trains. By contrast, dyslexics exhibited this profile of
      hemodynamic responses under the nonspeech condition only. As concerns syllables, 
      activation in dyslexics did not depend on presentation rate. Moreover, a
      subtraction analysis of hemodynamic main effects across conditions and groups
      revealed decreased activation both of the left and right anterior insula in
      dyslexics compared to controls during application both of click and syllables.
      These results indicate, in line with preceding studies, that the insula of both
      hemispheres is involved in auditory temporal processing of nonlinguistic auditory
      stimuli and demonstrate, furthermore, that these operations of intrasylvian
      cortex also extend to the linguistic domain. In addition, our data suggest that
      the anterior insula represents an important neural correlate of deficient
      temporal processing of speech and nonspeech sounds in dyslexia.

TI  - Functional interaction of DYX1C1 with estrogen receptors suggests involvement of 
      hormonal pathways in dyslexia.
PG  - 2802-12
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddp215 [doi]
AB  - Dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is the unexpected failure in learning
      to read and write when intelligence and senses are normal. One of the
      susceptibility genes, DYX1C1, has been implicated in neuronal migration, but
      little is known about its interactions and functions. As DYX1C1 was suggested to 
      interact with the U-box protein CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsc70-interacting
      protein), which also participates in the degradation of estrogen receptors alpha 
      (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), we hypothesized that the effects of DYX1C1 might be 
      at least in part mediated through the regulation of ERs. ERs have shown to be
      important in brain development and cognitive functions. Indeed, we show that
      DYX1C1 interacts with both ERs in the presence of 17beta-estradiol, as determined
      by co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. Protein
      levels of endogenous ERalpha or exogenous ERbeta were reduced upon
      over-expression of DYX1C1, resulting in decreased transcriptional responses to
      17beta-estradiol. Furthermore, we detected in vivo complexes of DYX1C1 with
      ERalpha or ERbeta at endogenous levels along neurites of primary rat hippocampal 
      neurons. Taken together, our data suggest that DYX1C1 is involved in the
      regulation of ERalpha and ERbeta, and may thus affect the brain development and
      regulate cognitive functions. These findings provide novel insights into the
      function of DYX1C1 and link neuronal migration and developmental dyslexia to the 
      estrogen-signaling effects in the brain.

TI  - Stroke secondary to calcific bicuspid aortic valve: case report and literature
      review.
PG  - 158-61
LID - 10.1016/j.jjcc.2008.10.011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic valve calcification is common in rheumatic endocarditis,
      elderly patients, and congenital bicuspid aortic valve. It is not a recognized
      risk factor for stroke. We report a case of non-calcific embolization from
      calcified bicuspid aortic valve. METHODS: A 52-year-old male with bicuspid aortic
      valve presented with aphasia and right arm weakness of less than 3h duration. CT 
      head revealed hypodensity in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) distribution
      and laboratory testing showed factor V leiden heterozygosity. The patient
      improved after intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), but developed 
      recurrence of right sided hemiparesis and silent myocardial infarction (MI).
      Cerebral angiography revealed clot in the left MCA. The patient received t-PA
      followed by transcatheter clot retrieval and was started on anticoagulation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Embolization from calcific bicuspid aortic valves can lead to stroke
      and MI. Conservative management with anticoagulation for treatment of associated 
      poststagnation thrombosis or aortic valve replacement as treatment is debatable. 
      This patient was successfully managed with anticoagulation.

TI  - Persistence of literacy problems: spelling in adolescence and at mid-life.
PG  - 893-901

AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental reading problems show strong persistence across the
      school years; less is known about poor readers' later progress in literacy
      skills. METHOD: Poor (n = 42) and normally developing readers (n = 86) tested in 
      adolescence (ages 14/15 years) in the Isle of Wight epidemiological studies were 
      re-contacted at mid-life (ages 44/45 years). Participants completed a spelling
      test, and reported on educational qualifications, perceived adult spelling
      competence, and problems in day-to-day literacy tasks. RESULTS: Individual
      differences in spelling were highly persistent across this 30-year follow-up,
      with correlations between spelling at ages 14 and 44 years of r = .91 (p < .001) 
      for poor readers and r = .89 (p < .001) for normally developing readers. Poor
      readers' spelling remained markedly impaired at mid-life, with some evidence that
      they had fallen further behind over the follow-up period. Taking account of
      adolescent spelling levels, continued exposure to reading and literacy demands in
      adolescence and early adulthood was independently predictive of adult spelling in
      both samples; family social background added further to prediction among normally
      developing readers only. CONCLUSIONS: By adolescence, individual differences in
      spelling and its related sub-skills are highly stable. Encouraging young people
      with reading disabilities to maintain their exposure to reading and writing may
      be advantageous in the longer term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to detect phonemes in spoken language (phonological
      processing) is equally important for first and secondary language acquisition
      (reading, spelling, orthography). Nevertheless, it is a subject of some
      controversy whether psychometric tests of auditory verbal stimuli (linguistic
      load) are to take in account in the diagnostics of (central) auditory processing 
      disorders (C)APD. METHODS: Data in phonological synthesis and in verbal auditory 
      closure, obtained from a research database of children who were audiologically
      and psychologically diagnosed as with auditory processing deficits, were analyzed
      retrospectively. These data were collected by a clinical psychologist in the
      diagnostic setting, who administered the subtests Sound Blending and Auditory
      Closure out of the German version of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic
      Abilities. PARTICIPANTS: Three clinical groups: n=51 with monosymptomatic APD;
      n=33 with APD+developmental language impairment; n=15 with APD and developmental 
      dyslexia and one control group (typically developing children without clinical
      developmental disorders). Inclusion criteria: normal hearing status and nonverbal
      intelligence, monolingual German-speaking, no suspicion of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorders and visual perception disorders and scoring > or = 2 SDs 
      below the reference mean in at least 2 auditory symptoms. RESULTS: The controls
      showed the best performance in "Sound Blending" (T-score 49.2; SD 8.8), followed 
      by children with monosymptomatic APD (T-score 48.0; SD 9.5) and children with
      co-morbid conditions (APD+developmental dyslexia: T-score 45.9; SD 6.0;
      APD+language impairment: T-score 44.4; SD 8.7). The differences between the
      groups did not reach statistical significance. Test scores in "Auditory Closure" 
      were consistently poorer in the APD-groups (children with monosymptomatic APD:
      T-score 50.9; SD 8.8; children with APD+developmental dyslexia: T-score 49.6; SD 
      7.7; children with APD+developmental language impairment: T-score 47.1; SD 10.5) 
      than for the normal group (T-score 54.9; SD 7.5). None of the groups performed
      any differently from the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Because the acoustic-verbal
      automatic dimensions of sound blending and auditory closure did not differentiate
      the 4 study groups, experts should renounce of them in the diagnostics of
      (C)APDs.

TI  - Ethanol affects transforming growth factor beta1-initiated signals: cross-talking
      pathways in the developing rat cerebral wall.
PG  - 9521-33
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2371-09.2009 [doi]
AB  - TGFbeta1 regulates early cortical development by moving young neurons from the
      proliferative population and promoting their migration. Altered
      TGFbeta1-regulated signaling can lead to abnormal development underlying
      microencephaly and migratory defects as in attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder, dyslexia, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The present study tested
      the hypotheses that TGFbeta1 signals through cross-talking Smad2/3 and
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways and that ethanol
      simulates these TGFbeta1-initiated signals. Slices generated from the
      telencephalons of 17-d-old rat fetuses were treated with TGFbeta1 (0 or 10
      ng/ml), ethanol (0, 200, 400, or 800 mg/dl), and/or a pharmacological agent [to
      block phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (SB431542 or LY364947) or ERK1/2 (PD98059 or
      U0126)]. In some experiments, the proliferative compartment (the ventricular and 
      subventricular zones; S/VZ) and the postproliferative compartment (intermediate
      zone/cortical plate/marginal zone) were examined separately. Smad2/3
      phosphorylation increased following treatment with TGFbeta1, ethanol, and PD98059
      (or U0126) plus ethanol. In contrast, SB431542 (and LY364947) blocked Smad2/3
      activation and led to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These changes revealed cross
      talk between the two TGFbeta1-responsive pathways. TGFbeta1-induced effects were 
      primarily in the S/VZ, whereas ethanol induced activation in both compartments.
      In summary, TGFbeta1 activates two separate pathways (Smad2/3 and ERK1/2) that
      actively interact. Ethanol simulates TGFbeta1-induced changes in these signaling 
      systems. Each pathway is preferentially activated during specific developmental
      events: the Smad2/3 pathway is key for cells exiting from the cycling population 
      and the ERK1/2 pathway is particularly inducible during neuronal migration.

TI  - The dyslexia-associated protein KIAA0319 interacts with adaptor protein 2 and
      follows the classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.
PG  - C160-8
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00630.2008 [doi]
AB  - Recently, genetic studies have implicated KIAA0319 in developmental dyslexia, the
      most common of the childhood learning disorders. The first functional data
      indicated that the KIAA0319 protein is expressed on the plasma membrane and may
      be involved in neuronal migration. Further analysis of the subcellular
      distribution of the overexpressed protein in mammalian cells indicates that
      KIAA0319 can colocalize with the early endosomal marker early endosome antigen 1 
      (EEA1) in large intracellular vesicles, suggesting that it is endocytosed.
      Antibody internalization assays with full-length KIAA0319 and deletion constructs
      confirmed that KIAA0319 is internalized and showed the importance of the
      cytoplasmic juxtamembranal region in this process. The present study has
      identified the medium subunit (mu2) of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) as a binding
      partner of KIAA0319 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Using Rab5 mutants or depletion
      of the mu-subunit of AP-2 or clathrin heavy chain by RNA interference, we
      demonstrate that KIAA0319 follows a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. We also 
      identify tyrosine-995 of KIAA0319 as a critical amino acid required for the
      interaction with AP-2 and subsequent internalization. These results suggest the
      surface expression of KIAA0319 is regulated by endocytosis, supporting the idea
      that the internalization and recycling of the protein may be involved in fine
      tuning its role in neuronal migration.

TI  - Enhanced activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in deaf and dyslexic
      adults during rhyming.
PG  - 1928-40
LID - 10.1093/brain/awp129 [doi]
AB  - Hearing developmental dyslexics and profoundly deaf individuals both have
      difficulties processing the internal structure of words (phonological processing)
      and learning to read. In hearing non-impaired readers, the development of
      phonological representations depends on audition. In hearing dyslexics, many
      argue, auditory processes may be impaired. In congenitally profoundly deaf
      individuals, auditory speech processing is essentially absent. Two separate
      literatures have previously reported enhanced activation in the left inferior
      frontal gyrus in both deaf and dyslexic adults when contrasted with hearing
      non-dyslexics during reading or phonological tasks. Here, we used a rhyme
      judgement task to compare adults from these two special populations to a hearing 
      non-dyslexic control group. All groups were matched on non-verbal intelligence
      quotient, reading age and rhyme performance. Picture stimuli were used since this
      requires participants to generate their own phonological representations, rather 
      than have them partially provided via text. By testing well-matched groups of
      participants on the same task, we aimed to establish whether previous literatures
      reporting differences between individuals with and without phonological
      processing difficulties have identified the same regions of differential
      activation in these two distinct populations. The data indicate greater
      activation in the deaf and dyslexic groups than in the hearing non-dyslexic group
      across a large portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This includes the pars
      triangularis, extending superiorly into the middle frontal gyrus and posteriorly 
      to include the pars opercularis, and the junction with the ventral precentral
      gyrus. Within the left inferior frontal gyrus, there was variability between the 
      two groups with phonological processing difficulties. The superior posterior tip 
      of the left pars opercularis, extending into the precentral gyrus, was activated 
      to a greater extent by deaf than dyslexic participants, whereas the superior
      posterior portion of the pars triangularis extending into the ventral pars
      opercularis, was activated to a greater extent by dyslexic than deaf
      participants. Whether these regions play differing roles in compensating for poor
      phonological processing is not clear. However, we argue that our main finding of 
      greater inferior frontal gyrus activation in both groups with phonological
      processing difficulties in contrast to controls suggests greater reliance on the 
      articulatory component of speech during phonological processing when auditory
      processes are absent (deaf group) or impaired (dyslexic group). Thus, the brain

PG  - 2278-92
LID - 10.1002/hbm.20670 [doi]
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed about the brain underpinnings of developmental
      dyslexia, but none of them accommodates the variable deficits observed. To
      address the issue of anatomical deficits in dyslexia; total and partial volumes, 
      lateralization indices (LI), and local gray matter volumes (LGMV) were measured. 
      Analyses were performed in large samples of control and dyslexic subjects, and in
      correlation with their performance on phonological, reading, and spelling tests. 
      Results indicate an absence of net differences in terms of volumes but
      significant continuities and discontinuities between groups in their correlations
      between LI, LGMV, and performances. Structural connectivity also highlighted
      correlations between areas showing (dis)continuities between control and dyslexic
      subjects. Overall, our data put forward the idea of a multifocal brain
      abnormalities in dyslexia with a major implication of the left superior temporal 
      gyrus, occipital-temporal cortices, and lateral/medial cerebellum, which could
      account for the diverse deficits predicted by the different theories.

TI  - Auditory processing disorder in relation to developmental disorders of language, 
      communication and attention: a review and critique.
PG  - 440-65
LID - 10.1080/13682820902929073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) does not feature in mainstream
      diagnostic classifications such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), but is frequently diagnosed in the United
      States, Australia and New Zealand, and is becoming more frequently diagnosed in
      the United Kingdom. AIMS: To familiarize readers with current controversies
      surrounding APD, with an emphasis on how APD might be conceptualized in relation 
      to language and reading problems, attentional problems and autistic spectrum
      disorders. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Different conceptual and diagnostic approaches
      adopted by audiologists and psychologists can lead to a confusing picture whereby
      the child who is regarded as having a specific learning disability by one group
      of experts may be given an APD diagnosis by another. While this could be
      indicative of co-morbidity, there are concerns that different professional groups
      are using different labels for the same symptoms. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS:
      APD, as currently diagnosed, is not a coherent category, but that rather than
      abandoning the construct, we need to develop improved methods for assessment and 
      diagnosis, with a focus on interdisciplinary evaluation.

PG  - 1029-34
LID - 10.1016/j.ijporl.2009.04.004 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The current study aims to assess: (a) the prevalence of auditory processing 
      in a population of children reporting learning difficulties, (b) the correlation 
      of APD diagnosis with age, the intelligence coefficient (IQ) and with the
      presence of a specific learning disability such as dyslexia and (c) to evaluate
      the reliability of each auditory processing test used in this study in
      identifying APD. METHOD: We evaluated one hundred and twenty-seven consecutive
      children referred to the academic tertiary LD Clinic of the Psychiatric
      Department by means of a psychoacoustic mainly non-verbal test battery. RESULTS: 
      APD was found to be present in 43.3% and co-existing with developmental dyslexia 
      in 25% of cases. The diagnosis of APD correlated with age in that children with
      APD were younger by 2 years than those without a diagnosis of APD. The diagnosis 
      of APD did not correlate with IQ or with the diagnosis of dyslexia.
      INTERPRETATION: High prevalence of APD in the targeted group of children
      suspected of Learning Disabilities sets the grounds for a possible benefit in
      screening for the disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eclectic test combinations are usually applied for diagnosing
      (Central) Auditory Processing Disorders (C)APD in school-aged children. METHODS: 
      Children with suspected APD were examined with a combination of 12 audiological
      and psychometric tests in order to allow the proper allocation to either the
      APD-group or to the Non-APD-group. PATIENTS: Forty-six 8-10-year-old children
      diagnosed with auditory-specific perceptual deficits [clinical group (C)APD;
      average age 9;2 years; SD 0;7 years] were compared to 39 normally developed
      children of the same age span with no evidence of specific language impairment,
      developmental dyslexia or learning disorders [control group Non-APD; average age 
      9;3 years; SD 0;7 years]. RESULTS: Overall, the Non-APD-group scored
      significantly better than the (C)APD-group with the exception of three non-verbal
      auditory tests. The clinical group and the control group were successfully
      differentiated: 94% and (after cross-validation) 91% of the children respectively
      could be diagnosed correctly by using only three tests (significant discriminant 
      function). Of these, Mottier's Test (nonword repetition) showed the highest
      discriminatory power followed by speech in noise discrimination and "phoneme
      differentiation" of the Heidelberger Phoneme Discrimination Test. CONCLUSION:
      After the differential diagnostic exclusion of peripheral hearing disorders and
      cognitive impairments, these three tests are sufficient to initially justify the 
      clinical-diagnostic classification "(C)APD" in 8-11-year-old children taking into
      account only a relatively slight probability of error. Poor results in two of the
      three differentiating tests (discrepancy criterion of >1 SD of the reference
      population) are sufficient to support the diagnostic classification of an (C)APD.

AB  - Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) was used to investigate the relationship between
      white matter and reading abilities in reading impaired and non-reading impaired
      children. Seventeen children (7 non-reading impaired, 10 reading impaired)
      participated in this study. DTI was performed with 2mm isotropic resolution to
      cover the entire brain along 30 noncollinear directions. Voxelwise analyses were 
      conducted on data processed through Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). The
      data replicated previous results seen across multiple studies and extended
      findings to include measures of both real word and pseudoword decoding. Negative 
      correlations were observed in the left posterior corpus callosum between
      fractional anisotropy (FA) values and both measures of decoding. Positive
      correlations between FA values and real word and pseudoword decoding were
      observed in the left superior corona radiata. This extension of findings
      regarding correlations between the corona radiata and reading skills suggests an 
      important direction for future research into the neurological substrates of
      reading.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental dyslexia is a specific cognitive disorder in reading
      acquisition that has genetic and neurological origins. Despite histological
      evidence for brain differences in dyslexia, we recently demonstrated that in
      large cohort of subjects, no differences between control and dyslexic readers can
      be found at the macroscopic level (MRI voxel), because of large variances in
      brain local volumes. In the present study, we aimed at finding brain areas that
      most discriminate dyslexic from control normal readers despite the large variance
      across subjects. After segmenting brain grey matter, normalizing brain size and
      shape and modulating the voxels' content, normal readers' brains were used to
      build a 'typical' brain via bootstrapped confidence intervals. Each dyslexic
      reader's brain was then classified independently at each voxel as being within or
      outside the normal range. We used this simple strategy to build a brain map
      showing regional percentages of differences between groups. The significance of
      this map was then assessed using a randomization technique. RESULTS: The right
      cerebellar declive and the right lentiform nucleus were the two areas that
      significantly differed the most between groups with 100% of the dyslexic subjects
      (N = 38) falling outside of the control group (N = 39) 95% confidence interval
      boundaries. The clinical relevance of this result was assessed by inquiring
      cognitive brain-based differences among dyslexic brain subgroups in comparison to
      normal readers' performances. The strongest difference between dyslexic subgroups
      was observed between subjects with lower cerebellar declive (LCD) grey matter
      volumes than controls and subjects with higher cerebellar declive (HCD) grey
      matter volumes than controls. Dyslexic subjects with LCD volumes performed worse 
      than subjects with HCD volumes in phonologically and lexicon related tasks.
      Furthermore, cerebellar and lentiform grey matter volumes interacted in dyslexic 
      subjects, so that lower and higher lentiform grey matter volumes compared to
      controls differently modulated the phonological and lexical performances. Best
      performances (observed in controls) corresponded to an optimal value of grey
      matter and they dropped for higher or lower volumes. CONCLUSION: These results
      provide evidence for the existence of various subtypes of dyslexia characterized 
      by different brain phenotypes. In addition, behavioural analyses suggest that
      these brain phenotypes relate to different deficits of automatization of
      language-based processes such as grapheme/phoneme correspondence and/or rapid
      access to lexicon entries.

AB  - This paper explores implicit learning in typically developing and primary school 
      children (9-12 years old) with developmental dyslexia using an artificial grammar
      learning (AGL) task. Two experiments were conducted, which differed in time of
      presentation and nature of the instructional set (experiment 1--implicit
      instructions vs experiment 2--explicit instructions). Repeated measures analysis 
      of variance (group x grammaticality x chunk strength) showed a group effect only 
      in experiment 1 (implicit instructions), with only the typically developing
      children showing evidence of AGL. There was a grammaticality effect (adherence to
      the rules) for both groups in the two experimental situations. We suggest that
      the typically developing children exhibited intact implicit learning as
      manifested in AGL performance, whereas children with developmental dyslexia
      failed to provide such evidence due to possible mediating cognitive developmental
      factors.

AB  - Aim of the research was to examine similarities and differences between the
      periods of experiencing visually stimulated directed speech-language information 
      and periods of undirected attention. The examined group comprised N = 64
      children, aged 4-5, with different speech-language disorders (developmental
      dysphasia, hyperactive syndrome with attention disorder, children with borderline
      intellectual abilities, autistic complex). Theta EEG was registered in children
      in the period of watching and describing the picture ("task"), and in the period 
      of undirected attention ("passive period"). The children were recorded in
      standard EEG conditions, at 19 points of EEG registration and in longitudinal
      bipolar montage. Results in the observed age-operative theta rhythm indicated
      significant similarities and differences in the prevalence of spatial engagement 
      of certain regions between the two hemispheres at the input and output of
      processing, which opens the possibility for more detailed analysis of conscious
      control of speech-language processing and its disorders.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the prevalence, cognitive profile, and home
      literacy experiences in subtypes of Spanish developmental dyslexia. The subtyping
      procedure used comparison with chronological-age-matched and reading-level
      controls on reaction times and accuracy responses to high-frequency words and
      pseudowords. Using regression-based procedures, 8 phonological dyslexics and 16
      surface dyslexics were identified from a sample of 35 dyslexic fourth graders by 
      comparing them with chronological-age-matched controls on reaction times to
      high-frequency word and pseudoword reading. However, when the dyslexic subtypes
      were defined by reference to reading-level controls, 12 phonological dyslexics
      were defined but only 5 surface dyslexics were identified. Both dyslexic subtypes
      showed a deficit in phonological awareness, but children with surface dyslexia
      also showed a deficit in orthographical processing assessed by a homophone
      comprehension task. This deficit was associated with poor home literacy
      experiences, with the group of parents with children matched in reading age, in
      comparison with the group of parents with children with surface dyslexia,
      reporting more literacy home experiences.

TI  - Auditory processing in developmental dyslexia: an exploratory study of an
      auditory and visual matching training program with Swedish children with
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 277-85
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-9450.2009.00708.x [doi]
AB  - This study examined whether training using a nonverbal auditory-visual matching
      task had a remedial effect on reading skills in developmental dyslexia. The
      pretest/post-test design was used with Swedish children (N= 41), between the ages
      of 7 and 12. Training comprised twice-weekly sessions of 15 minutes, over eight
      weeks. There was an improvement in auditory-visual matching during the training
      period. There were also improvements in some reading test scores, especially in
      reading nonsense words and in reading speed. These improvements in tasks which
      are thought to rely on phonological processing suggest that such reading
      difficulties in dyslexia may stem in part from more basic perceptual
      difficulties, including those required to manage the visual and auditory
      components of the decoding task. The utility of the concept of auditory
      structuring is discussed in relation to auditory and phonological processing
      skills when a child learns to read.

PG  - 241-8
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.01.035 [doi]
AB  - Disorders of categorical perception has been put forward as a new account of
      phonological deficit in dyslexia (Serniclaes, W., Sprenger-Charolles, L., Carre, 
      R. and Demonet, J.F., 2001. Perceptual discrimination of speech sounds in
      developmental dyslexia. J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. 44, 384-399.) so that dyslexic
      subjects tend to discriminate phoneme instances within a given phonemic category 
      rather than between categories, possibly witnessing the persistence of phonemic
      boundaries of 'allophones' that may be relevant to other languages although not
      to one's mother tongue (Serniclaes, W., Van Heghe, S., Mousty, P., Carre, R. and 
      Sprenger-Charolles, L., 2004. Allophonic mode of speech perception in dyslexia.
      J. Exp. Child Psychol. 87, 336-361.). The brain correlates of within- and
      between-category discrimination were explored using a /ba/-/da/ phonetic
      continuum and H(2)(15)O PET in 14 dyslexic and 16 control adult readers; subjects
      discriminated a set of stimuli pairs, first in a 'naive' (acoustic) condition
      and, after debriefing about the stimuli identity, in a speech (phonemic)
      condition (Dufor, O., Serniclaes, W., Sprenger-Charolles, L. and Demonet, J.F.,
      2007. Top-down processes during auditory phoneme categorization in dyslexia: a
      PET study. NeuroImage 34, 1692-1707.). While discrimination of 'between' pairs
      improved in all subjects following debriefing, 'within' stimuli yielded variable 
      performance; some subjects kept discriminating them, while best categorizers
      judged them identical. Correlation analyses between acoustic-to-speech changes in
      brain activity and in 'within'-pair discrimination, and between control and
      dyslexic groups, revealed a criss-crossed correlation pattern in the left BA6 so 
      that the higher the activity the better the categorization in control subjects
      whereas the higher the activity the more increased 'within' discrimination in
      dyslexic subjects. Therefore, in average readers, enhanced activity in the left
      BA6 likely contributes to optimizing phoneme categorization via refined speech
      motor coding. In dyslexic subjects showing sensitivity to 'within'-category cues,
      activity enhancement in this region might suggest the persistence of motor coding
      for allophonic representations of speech.

PG  - 245-54
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acp028 [doi]
AB  - The goals of this project were threefold: to determine the nature of the memory
      deficit in children/adolescents with dyslexia, to utilize clinical memory
      measures in this endeavor, and to determine the extent to which semantic
      short-term memory (STM) is related to basic reading performance. Two studies were
      conducted using different samples, one incorporating the Wide Range Assessment of
      Memory and Learning and the other incorporating the California Verbal Learning
      Test-Children's Version. Results suggest that phonological STM is deficient in
      children with dyslexia, but semantic STM and visual-spatial STM are intact.
      Long-term memory (LTM) for both visual and verbal material also is intact.
      Regarding reading performance, semantic STM had small correlations with word
      identification and pseudoword decoding across studies despite phonological STM
      being moderately to strongly related to both basic reading skills. Overall,
      results are consistent with the phonological core deficit model of dyslexia as
      only phonological STM was affected in dyslexia and related to basic reading
      skill.

LID - 10.1080/13854040802448718 [doi]
AB  - We present a 56 year-old, right-handed, congenitally deaf female who exhibited a 
      partial Balint's syndrome accompanied by positive visual phenomena restricted to 
      her lower right visual quadrant (e.g., color band, transient unformed visual
      hallucinations). Balint's syndrome is characterized by a triad of visuo-ocular
      symptoms that typically occur following bilateral parieto-occipital lobe lesions.
      These symptoms include the inability to perceive simultaneous events in one's
      visual field (simultanagnosia), an inability to fixate and follow an object with 
      one's eyes (optic apraxia), and an impairment of target pointing under visual
      guidance (optic ataxia). Our patient exhibited simultanagnosia, optic ataxia,
      left visual field neglect, and impairment of all complex visual-spatial tasks,
      yet demonstrated normal visual acuity, intact visual fields, and an otherwise
      normal neurocognitive profile. The patient's visuo-ocular symptoms were noticed
      while she was participating in rehabilitation for a small right pontine stroke.
      White matter changes involving both occipital lobes had been incidentally noted
      on the CT scan revealing the pontine infarction. As the patient relied on sign
      language and reading ability for communication, these visuo-perceptual
      limitations hindered her ability to interact with others and gave the appearance 
      of aphasia. We discuss the technical challenges of assessing a patient with
      significant barriers to communication (e.g., the need for a non-standardized
      approach, a lack of normative data for such special populations), while pointing 
      out the substantial contributions that can be made by going beyond the standard
      neuropsychological test batteries.

AB  - The clinical relevance of central auditory processing disorders (CAPD) is highly 
      controversial. The paper explicates different concepts of CAPD and reviews
      empirical studies of the relationship between auditory deficits and learning or
      psychiatric disorders. The overview of the available literature reveals that
      numerous authors have described subnormal auditory abilities in groups of
      children with developmental language disorders, dyslexia or ADHD. However, little
      or no relationship between the severity of clinical impairment and auditory
      deficits has been found. Thus auditory deficits do not appear to be causally
      related to learning disorders or conduct disorders. With respect to the
      diagnostic process the review makes clear that the validity of the diagnosis CAPD
      is low. There is no agreement about diagnostic criteria, and the reliability of
      most auditory tests in insufficient. Moreover, while an auditory training can
      only improve the directly trained auditory functions, there is no transfer effect
      to learning ability of behavior. Altogether there is little evidence for a
      significant relevance of CAPD in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that crowding effects are responsible for the reading
      slowness characteristic of developmental dyslexia. A total of twenty-nine Italian
      dyslexics and thirty-three age-matched controls participated in various parts of 
      the study. In Experiment 1, we measured contrast thresholds for identifying
      letters and words as a function of stimulus duration. Thresholds were higher in
      dyslexics than controls for words (at a limited time exposure) but not for single
      letters. Adding noise to the stimuli produced comparable effects in dyslexics and
      controls. At the long time exposure thresholds were comparable in the two groups.
      In Experiment 2, we measured the spacing between a target letter and two flankers
      at a fixed level of performance as a function of eccentricity and size. With
      eccentricity, the critical spacing (CS) scaled in the control group with 0.62
      proportionality (a value of b close to Bouma's law, 0.50) and with a greater
      proportionality (0.95) in the dyslexic group. CS was independent of size in both 
      groups. In Experiment 3, we examined the critical print size (CPS), that is, the 
      increase in reading rate up to a critical character size (S. T. Chung, J. S.
      Mansfield, & G. E. Legge, 1998). CPS of dyslexic children was greater than that
      of controls. Individual maximal reading speed was predicted by individual bs
      (from Experiment 2). The maximal reading rate achieved by dyslexics at CPS (and
      also for larger print sizes) was below the values observed in controls. We
      conclude that word analysis in dyslexics is slowed because of greater crowding
      effects, which limit letter identification in multi-letter arrays across the
      visual field. We propose that the peripheral reading of normal readers might
      constitute a model for dyslexic reading. The periphery model accounts for 60% of 
      dyslexics' slowness. After compensating for crowding, the dyslexics' reading rate
      remains slower than that of proficient readers. This failure is discussed in
      terms of a developmental learning effect.

AB  - The film Taare Zameen Par (Stars upon the Ground) portrays the tormented life at 
      school and at home of a child with dyslexia and his eventual success after his
      artistic talents are discovered by his art teacher at the boarding school. The
      film hints at a curious neurocognitive phenomenon of creativity in the midst of
      language disability, as exemplified in the lives of people like Leonardo da Vinci
      and Albert Einstein, both of whom demonstrated extraordinary creativity even
      though they were probably affected with developmental learning disorders. It has 
      been hypothesized that a developmental delay in the dominant hemisphere most
      likely 'disinhibits' the nondominant parietal lobe, unmasking talents-artistic or
      otherwise-in some such individuals. It has been suggested that, in remedial
      training, children with learning disorders be encouraged to develop such hidden
      talents to full capacity, rather than be subjected to the usual overemphasis on
      the correction of the disturbed coded symbol operations.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The last decade has generated much interest in the genetics of
      developmental disorders. This interest, in part, is focused on two issues: the
      specificity/generality and the type/frequency of the genetic mechanisms involved.
      RECENT FINDINGS: First, it appears that studies are more fruitful and their
      results more replicable, broadly speaking, when they conceptualize disorders not 
      holistically, as categorical units, but componentially, through various
      quantitative processes. Second, there have been several successful investigations
      of severe impairments in a number of isolated families with higher than typical
      frequencies of developmental disorders. Yet, it has been difficult to generalize 
      the genetic mechanisms involved in these rare cases to the general population.
      SUMMARY: Current findings suggest the involvement of multiple genetic mechanisms 
      in the manifestations of childhood-onset conditions. It is possible that each
      'facet' (or component) of a disorder is controlled by a semi-independent set of
      genes. Numerous components appear to be deficient in more than one disorder,
      possibly explaining comorbidity. The genetic foundation of developmental
      disorders may be formed not by isolated genes, but rather by a combination of
      genes and the pathways that these genes regulate. These accumulating findings
      have direct implications for designing both diagnostic and treatment approaches
      to childhood-onset disorders.

AB  - Right heart infective endocarditis presenting as an isolated apical mural mass is
      an extremely uncommon finding. A 24-year-old woman with congenital deafness and
      aphasia was admitted with recurrent attacks of fever and lobar pneumonia. Her
      past medical history was significant for an open operation for left
      nephrolithiasis five months before admission. She had no history of congenital
      heart defect, intravenous drug use or central venous line insertion. Diagnostic
      workup revealed a large pedunculated solid mass attached to the apex of the right
      ventricle and multiple septic foci in both lungs. Repeated blood cultures were
      negative. In spite of aggressive antibiotic therapy, she had progressively
      worsening respiratory distress. She was successfully operated for the mass and
      the pathologic findings were consistent with endocarditis. To our knowledge, the 
      anatomical location of the mural endocarditis (apex of right ventricle) is a
      pretty uncommon condition.

AB  - Because poor comprehension has been associated with small cerebral volume and
      there is a high comorbidity between developmental dyslexia, attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific language impairment, the goal of this
      study was to determine whether cerebral volume is reduced in dyslexia and
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in general, as some suggest, or whether 
      the reduction in volume corresponds to poor receptive language functioning,
      regardless of the diagnosis. Participants included 46 children with and without
      dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, aged 8 to 12 years. Our
      results indicated that cerebral volume was comparable between those with and
      without dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder overall. However,
      when groups were further divided into those with and without receptive language
      difficulties, children with poor receptive language had smaller volumes
      bilaterally as hypothesized. Nonetheless, the relationship between cerebral
      volume and receptive language was not linear; rather, our results suggest that
      small volume is associated with poor receptive language only in those with the
      smallest volumes in both dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

TI  - Reduced neural integration of letters and speech sounds links phonological and
      reading deficits in adult dyslexia.
PG  - 503-8
LID - 10.1016/j.cub.2009.01.065 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a specific reading and spelling deficit affecting 4% to
      10% of the population. Advances in understanding its origin support a core
      deficit in phonological processing characterized by difficulties in segmenting
      spoken words into their minimally discernable speech segments (speech sounds, or 
      phonemes) and underactivation of left superior temporal cortex. A suggested but
      unproven hypothesis is that this phonological deficit impairs the ability to map 
      speech sounds onto their homologous visual letters, which in turn prevents the
      attainment of fluent reading levels. The present functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) study investigated the neural processing of letters and speech
      sounds in unisensory (visual, auditory) and multisensory (audiovisual congruent, 
      audiovisual incongruent) conditions as a function of reading ability. Our data
      reveal that adult dyslexic readers underactivate superior temporal cortex for the
      integration of letters and speech sounds. This reduced audiovisual integration is
      directly associated with a more fundamental deficit in auditory processing of
      speech sounds, which in turn predicts performance on phonological tasks. The data
      provide a neurofunctional account of developmental dyslexia, in which
      phonological processing deficits are linked to reading failure through a deficit 
      in neural integration of letters and speech sounds.

PG  - 1-18

AB  - Twin and family studies have demonstrated that most cognitive traits are
      moderately to highly heritable. Neurodevelopmental disorders such as dyslexia,
      autism, and specific language impairment (SLI) also show strong genetic
      influence. Nevertheless, it has proved difficult for researchers to identify
      genes that would explain substantial amounts of variance in cognitive traits or
      disorders. Although this observation may seem paradoxical, it fits with a
      multifactorial model of how complex human traits are influenced by numerous genes
      that interact with one another, and with the environment, to produce a specific
      phenotype. Such a model can also explain why genetic influences on cognition have
      not vanished in the course of human evolution. Recent linkage and association
      studies of SLI and dyslexia are reviewed to illustrate these points. The role of 
      nonheritable genetic mutations (sporadic copy number variants) in causing autism 
      is also discussed. Finally, research on phenotypic correlates of allelic
      variation in the genes ASPM and microcephalin is considered; initial interest in 
      these as genes for brain size or intelligence has been dampened by a failure to
      find phenotypic differences in people with different versions of these genes.
      There is a current vogue for investigators to include measures of allelic
      variants in studies of cognition and cognitive disorders. It is important to be
      aware that the effect sizes associated with these variants are typically small
      and hard to detect without extremely large sample sizes.

TI  - Language and reading abilities of children with autism spectrum disorders and
      specific language impairment and their first-degree relatives.
PG  - 22-38
LID - 10.1002/aur.63 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) are
      developmental disorders exhibiting language deficits, but it is unclear whether
      they arise from similar etiologies. Language impairments have been described in
      family members of children with ASD and SLI, but few studies have quantified
      them. In this study, we examined IQ, language, and reading abilities of ASD and
      SLI children and their first-degree relatives to address whether the language
      difficulties observed in some children with ASD are familial and to better
      understand the degree of overlap between these disorders and their broader
      phenotypes. Participants were 52 autistic children, 36 children with SLI, their
      siblings, and their parents. The ASD group was divided into those with (ALI,
      n=32) and without (ALN, n=20) language impairment. Relationships between ASD
      severity and language performance were also examined in the ASD probands. ALI and
      SLI probands performed similarly on most measures while ALN probands scored
      higher. ALN and ALI probands' language scores were not related to Autism
      Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule algorithm
      scores. SLI relatives scored lowest on all measures, and while scores were not in
      the impaired range, relatives of ALI children scored lower than relatives of ALN 
      children on some measures, though not those showing highest heritability in SLI. 
      Given that ALI relatives performed better than SLI relatives across the language 
      measures, the hypothesis that ALI and SLI families share similar genetic loading 
      for language is not strongly supported.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia and widespread activation across the cerebellar
      hemispheres.
PG  - 122-32
LID - 10.1016/j.bandl.2008.10.001 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is the most common learning disability in school-aged
      children with an estimated incidence of five to ten percent. The cause and
      pathophysiological substrate of this developmental disorder is unclear. Recently,
      a possible involvement of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of dyslexia has been
      postulated. In this study, 15 dyslexic children and 7 age-matched control
      subjects were investigated by means of functional neuroimaging (fMRI) using a
      noun-verb association paradigm. Comparison of activation patterns between
      dyslexic and control subjects revealed distinct and significant differences in
      cerebral and cerebellar activation. Control subjects showed bilaterally
      well-defined and focal activation patterns in the frontal and parietal lobes and 
      the posterior regions of the cerebellar hemispheres. The dyslexic children,
      however, presented widespread and diffuse activations on the cerebral and
      cerebellar level. Cerebral activations were found in frontal, parietal, temporal 
      and occipital regions. Activations in the cerebellum were found predominantly in 
      the cerebellar cortex, including Crus I, Crus II, hemispheric lobule VI, VII and 
      vermal lobules I, II, III, IV and VII. This preliminary study is the first to
      reveal a significant difference in cerebellar functioning between dyslexic
      children and controls during a semantic association task. As a result, we propose
      a new hypothesis regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms of developmental
      dyslexia. Given the sites of activation in the cerebellum in the dyslexic group, 
      a defect of the intra-cerebellar distribution of activity is suspected,
      suggesting a disorder of the processing or transfer of information within the
      cerebellar cortex.

      stability in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 627-33
LID - 10.1007/s00221-008-1568-5 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder associated with impaired postural
      control. However, such deficits are also found in attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD), which is present in a substantial subset of dyslexia diagnoses. 
      Very few studies of balance in dyslexia have assessed ADHD symptoms, thereby
      motivating the hypothesis that such measures can account for the group
      differences observed. In this study, we assessed adults with dyslexia and
      similarly aged controls on a battery of cognitive, literacy and attention
      measures, alongside tasks of postural stability. Displacements of centre of mass 
      to perturbations of posture were measured in four experimental conditions using
      digital optical motion capture. The largest group differences were obtained in
      conditions where cues to the support surface were reduced. Between-group
      differences in postural sway and in sway variability were largely accounted for
      by co-varying hyperactivity and inattention ratings, however. These results
      therefore suggest that postural instability in dyslexia is more strongly
      associated with symptoms of ADHD than to those specific to reading impairment.

LID - 10.1177/0883073808329572 [doi]
AB  - One of the core defining components of autism is impairment in communication,
      typically manifested as a delay in speech development. To date, neuroimaging
      studies have shed limited light on the mechanisms behind delay in speech
      development in autism. We performed magnetoencephalographic-based auditory
      language mapping in 2 cases of high-functioning autism. Overall, 2 distinct
      characteristics were found, such as the use of atypical language pathways and
      cortical hyperexcitability. These neurophysiological findings parallel those
      reported in 2 other developmental disorders, developmental dyslexia and Rett
      syndrome. We discuss common mechanisms that may account for cognitive delays
      across these developmental disorders.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a frequent language-based learning
      disorder. The predominant etiological view postulates that reading problems
      originate from a phonological impairment. METHOD: We studied mismatch negativity 
      (MMN) and Late Discriminative Negativity (LDN) to syllables change in both
      children (n=12; 8-12 years) and young adults (n=15; 14-23 years) with DD compared
      with controls. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: The present study confirmed abnormal automatic
      discrimination of syllable changes in both children and adults with developmental
      dyslexia. MMN topographic, amplitude and latency group differences were
      evidenced, suggesting different brain mechanisms involved in elementary auditory 
      stimulus change-detection in DD, especially in the left hemisphere. The LDN
      results demonstrated that the auditory disorder of temporal processing in DD
      children becomes more serious at late stages of information processing and that
      the apparent cerebral hypo reactivity to speech changes in DD actually may
      correspond to additional processes. The age-related differences observed in both 
      MMN and LDN topographies, amplitudes and latency between subjects with DD and
      controls could indicate different developmental courses in the neural
      representation of basic speech sounds in good and poor readers, with a tendency
      to normalization with increasing age. CONCLUSION: Our results showing atypical
      electrophysiological concomitants of speech auditory perception in DD strongly
      support the hypothesis of deviant cortical organization in DD.

PG  - 92-9
LID - 10.1016/j.tics.2008.11.002 [doi]
AB  - Research indicates that developmental dyscalculia (DD; a mathematical deficiency)
      involves a single brain area abnormality - in the intraparietal sulcus. This is
      surprising because, (i) the behavioural deficits are heterogeneous, (ii) multiple
      problems are most common in most cases (co-morbidity) and (iii) different aspects
      of intact number processing are represented in different brain areas. Hence,
      progress in the study of DD might be limited by conceptual issues. This work
      looks at biological and cognitive findings within DD and delineates frameworks
      for studying the neurocognitive basis of DD. We offer three alternative
      frameworks. These proposed frameworks have the potential of facilitating future
      discussions, work in the field and have implications for studies of similar
      disorders like dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

AB  - In this article, we critically review the evidence for overlap among three
      developmental disorders, namely speech sound disorder (SSD), language impairment 
      (LI), and reading disability (RD), at three levels of analysis: diagnostic,
      cognitive, and etiological. We find that while overlap exists at all three
      levels, it varies by comorbidity subtype, and the relations among these three
      disorders are complex and not fully understood. We evaluate which comorbidity
      models can be rejected or supported as explanations for why and how these three
      disorders overlap and what new data are needed to better define their relations.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep microstructure
      of children with dyslexia, by means of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) analysis 
      and to correlate CAP parameters with neuropsychological measures. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional study using polysomnographic recordings and neuropsychological
      assessments. Setting: Sleep laboratory in academic center. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen 
      subjects with developmental dyslexia (mean age 10.8 years) and 11 normally
      reading children (mean age 10.1 years) underwent overnight polysomnographic
      recording. Intervention: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep architecture
      parameters only showed some statistically significant differences: number of
      sleep stage shifts per hour of sleep, percentage of N3, and number of R periods
      were significantly lower in dyslexic children versus controls. CAP analysis
      revealed a higher total CAP rate and A1 index in stage N3. A2% and A2 index in
      stage N2 and N3 were lower in dyslexic children while no differences were found
      for A3 CAP subtypes. The correlation analysis between CAP parameters and
      cognitive-behavioral measures showed a significant positive correlation between
      A1 index in N3 with Verbal IQ, full-scale IQ, and Memory and Learning Transfer
      reading test; while CAP rate in N3 was positively correlated with verbal IQ.
      CONCLUSIONS: To overcome reading difficulties, dyslexic subjects overactivate
      thalamocortical and hippocampal circuitry to transfer information between
      cortical posterior and anterior areas. The overactivation of the ancillary
      frontal areas could account for the CAP rate modifications and mainly for the
      increase of CAP rate and of A1 index in N3 that seem to be correlated with IQ and
      reading abilities.

AB  - Children with specific language impairment (SLI) who show impaired phonological
      processing are at risk of developing reading disabilities, which raises the
      question of phonological impairment commonality between developmental dyslexia
      (DD) and SLI. In order to distinguish the failing phonological processes in SLI
      and DD, we investigated the different steps involved in speech processing going
      from perceptual discrimination through various aspects of phonological memory.
      Our results show that whereas the memory for sequence is likewise impaired in
      either disorder, children with SLI have to face additional impairment in
      phonological discrimination and short-term memory, which may account for even
      poorer phonological awareness than dyslexics'.

TI  - Gene X environment interactions in reading disability and
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 77-89
LID - 10.1037/a0014549 [doi]
AB  - This article examines Gene x Environment (G x E) interactions in two comorbid
      developmental disorders--reading disability (RD) and
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--as a window on broader issues on
      G x E interactions in developmental psychology. The authors first briefly review 
      types of G x E interactions, methods for detecting them, and challenges
      researchers confront in interpreting such interactions. They then review previous
      evidence for G x E interactions in RD and ADHD, the directions of which are
      opposite to each other: bioecological for RD and diathesis stress for ADHD. Given
      these results, the authors formulate and test predictions about G x E
      interactions that would be expected at the favorable end of each symptom
      dimension (e.g., above-average reading or attention). Consistent with their
      prediction, the authors found initial evidence for a resilience interaction for
      above-average reading: higher heritability in the presence of lower parental
      education. However, they did not find a G x E interaction at the favorable end of
      the ADHD symptom dimension. The authors conclude with implications for future
      research.

TI  - Controlled but independent: effects of mental rotation and developmental dyslexia
      in dual-task settings.
PG  - 1019-34
AB  - In two experiments, we compared the performance of normal-reading (n = 26) and
      dyslexic children (n = 22) in discriminating letters from their mirrored images. 
      In experiment 1, they were always presented in the upright orientation; in
      experiment 2, they were presented in different angular orientations (0 degrees,
      90 degrees, 180 degrees). In order to determine whether task and dyslexia affect 
      reaction times in early or late stages of processing, a dual-task paradigm was
      adopted in which the primary task was tone discrimination. Stimulus onset
      asynchrony (SOA) between first and second task was systematically varied (50 ms
      versus 400 ms). In both experiments dyslexics were slower overall than controls. 
      No effects of mirror-image letters were found. In experiment 2, mental-rotation
      effects were additive with SOA. In accordance with earlier findings we concluded 
      that the mental-rotation effect involves central processing capacity.
      Mental-rotation effects were the same for normal-reading and dyslexic children;
      mental rotation is not impaired in dyslexia. Remarkably, SOA effects were larger 
      in normal readers than in dyslexics. This result was explained by observing that 
      dyslexics experience decision difficulties already on the first task. As a
      result, they do not benefit optimally from increased latencies between first and 
      second tasks.

AB  - Early reading and spelling abilities in children from Ireland and Sweden with
      severe speech and physical impairment (SSPI) were studied and compared. The aim
      was to look for similarities as well as for differences that could be related to 
      the different linguistic environments. Both group consisted of 15 children, and
      were matched on linguistic age. Reading and spelling as well as phonological
      awareness and memory were tested. Both groups performed fairly well on the
      phonological awareness tasks, but the Swedish children did not seem to manage to 
      use this ability successfully for reading and spelling. Overall the Irish
      children showed a slightly stronger performance, and were significantly better at
      the reading tasks. There were some signs that children were affected by the
      structure of their individual languages. The Irish children revealed the greatest
      problems with pseudoword spelling which is in line with results from speaking
      children with English as their mother tongue and could be a result of using a
      strategy based on larger linguistic units. The Swedish children had particular
      problems with tasks presented without oral support, which may be an effect of
      memory problems due to their lack of articulatory ability.

AB  - Academic success and occupational outcome rely on a person's ability to attend to
      and learn from their surroundings. The cognitive mechanisms underlying these
      respective skills are impaired in individuals with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disability (LD). The high
      co-occurrence between ADHD and the learning disability developmental dyslexia has
      raised the possibility of a common etiology. We propose that studying the
      functional anatomy of disordered executive control and reading-related skills
      using carefully selected paradigms, coupled with rigorous studies of intervention
      efficacy, provide the most promising avenue for ameliorating these two commonly
      encountered impediments to learning.

TI  - Impact of cerebellar lesions on reading and phonological processing.
PG  - 260-74
LID - 10.1196/annals.1416.015 [doi]
AB  - The relationship between cerebellar function and reading abilities is unclear.
      One theory of developmental dyslexia implicates the cerebellum in this reading
      disorder. Neuroimaging studies in normal readers consistently show cerebellar
      activation in tasks that involve reading. However, neuropsychological evidence
      for a relationship between cerebellar function and skilled reading is sparse. To 
      further examine the role of the cerebellum in reading, we assessed reading skills
      and phonological processing in a group of patients with focal damage to the
      cerebellum. The patients' accuracy in naming single words and nonwords and their 
      reading fluency and comprehension did not differ from that of age- and
      education-matched healthy controls. The patients' performance on phonological
      awareness and phonological memory tasks was also within the range of the control 
      group, although their performance was highly variable. In contrast, cerebellar
      damage did significantly compromise performance in two other tasks associated
      with phonological processing. In a visual rhyme judgment task, a subset of the
      patient group was impaired on items with a mismatch between orthographic and
      phonological information. On a verbal working memory task, the cerebellar
      compared to the control group recalled fewer items from a list of nonwords, but
      not from lists of familiar items. On the basis of the patients' pattern of
      behavioral impairments, we propose that cerebellar damage affects an articulatory
      monitoring process. Our findings indicate that intact cerebellar function is not 
      necessary for skilled reading; however, we cannot exclude the potential

AB  - Reading and phonological processing deficits have been the primary focus of
      neuroimaging studies addressing the neurologic basis of developmental dyslexia,
      but to date there has been no objective assessment of the consistency of these
      findings. To address this issue, spatial coordinates reported in the literature
      were submitted to two parallel activation likelihood estimate (ALE)
      meta-analyses. First, a meta-analysis including 96 foci from nine publications
      identified regions where typical readers are likely to show greater activation
      than dyslexics: two left extrastriate areas within BA 37, precuneus, inferior
      parietal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, and left inferior frontal
      gyrus. Right hemisphere ALE foci representing hypoactivity in dyslexia were found
      in the fusiform, postcentral, and superior temporal gyri. To identify regions in 
      which dyslexic subjects reliably show greater activation than controls, 75 foci
      from six papers were entered into a second meta-analysis. Here ALE results
      revealed hyperactivity associated with dyslexia in right thalamus and anterior
      insula. These findings suggest that during the performance of a variety of
      reading tasks, normal readers activate left-sided brain areas more than dyslexic 
      readers do, whereas dyslexia is associated with greater right-sided brain
      activity. The most robust result was in left extrastriate cortex, where
      hypoactivity associated with dyslexia was found. However, the ALE maps provided
      no support for cerebellar dysfunction, nor for hyperactivity in left frontal
      cortex in dyslexia, suggesting that these findings, unlike those described above,
      are likely to be more varied in terms of their reproducibility or spatial
      location.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is associated with problems in a range of linguistic and
      non-linguistic skills. Some of those problems have been attributed to dysfunction
      of the cerebellum and its associated neural systems. Two studies of cerebellar
      structure were undertaken by our group. In Study 1, white and grey matter volumes
      in the cerebellum were investigated in 10 dyslexic and 11 control adult male,
      right-handed participants using whole-brain volumetric MRI (3D-T1-weighted data
      sets with a spatial resolution of 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm(3)). The key finding was
      that the dyslexic group had a larger volume of white matter in both cerebellar
      hemispheres, differences that remained significant even when adjusting for total 
      cerebellar volume. In Study 2, with the same participants, long-echo-time proton 
      spectroscopy was used to investigate the ratios of the metabolites choline (Cho),
      N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and creatine (Cr) in the cerebellar hemispheres and
      vermis. Two significant differences were found: The dyslexic group had a lower
      ratio of NAA/Cho in the right cerebellar hemisphere together with a higher ratio 
      of Cho/Cr in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Although it is difficult to
      interpret the volumetric and spectroscopic results unambiguously, taken together 
      they suggest two possible interpretations: excessive connectivity or abnormal
      myelination.

AB  - Several neuroimaging studies in developmental dyslexia (DD) have mainly focused
      on brain regions subserving phonological processes. However, additional deficits 
      characterize subjects with DD, such as an impairment of visual and rapid stimuli 
      processing and deficits in implicit learning (IL). Little is known about
      structural abnormalities in brain regions not directly related to phonology and
      reading processes. The aim of this study was to investigate, using voxel-based
      morphometry, whether subjects with DD exhibit any structural grey matter (GM)
      abnormalities in regions that have previously shown abnormal functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging (fMRI) activation during an IL task. Significantly smaller GM
      volumes were found in the right posterior superior parietal lobule and precuneus 
      and in the right supplementary motor area (SMA) of subjects with DD compared to
      controls. Moreover, a larger GM volume in parietal cortex was associated with an 
      increase of IL effect in controls but not in subjects with DD. These structural
      abnormalities are consistent with functional changes and reinforce the hypothesis
      that an impairment of IL might play a relevant role in learning to read.

AB  - In order to test the hypothesis of attentional deficits in dyslexia, we
      investigated the performance of children with developmental dyslexia on a number 
      of visual search tasks. When tested with conjunction tasks for orientation and
      form using complex, letter-like material, dyslexic children showed an increased
      number of errors accompanied by faster reaction times in comparison to control
      children matched to the dyslexics on age, gender, and intelligence. On
      conjunction tasks for orientation and color, dyslexic children were also less
      accurate, but showed slower reaction times than the age-matched control children.
      These differences between the two groups decreased with increasing age. In
      contrast to these differences, the performance of dyslexic children in feature
      search tasks was similar to that of control children. These results suggest that 
      children with developmental dyslexia present selective deficits in complex serial
      visual search tasks, implying impairment in goal-directed, sustained visual
      attention.

PG  - 173-83
LID - 10.1196/annals.1416.003 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is diagnosed when children fail to acquire literacy skills
      despite adequate education and intellectual ability. There is evidence of
      impaired implicit learning in dyslexia, and it is possible that poor implicit
      learning in dyslexic children affects their acquisition of complex skills such as
      reading. To assess whether children with dyslexia show evidence of poor implicit 
      motor learning, 45 dyslexic children completed a serial reaction time task
      (SRTT). Age-matched controls (n= 44) and nondyslexic poor readers
      ("garden-variety" poor readers, n= 20) were used as comparison groups. The
      inclusion of the garden-variety poor-reader group allows us to address the
      specificity of implicit learning deficits to dyslexics, as opposed to poor
      readers who do not have a discrepancy between their intellectual and literacy
      skills. There were no significant differences between the three groups in
      performance accuracy. However, whereas the controls and garden-variety poor
      readers showed good implicit learning (measured by a significant reduction in
      response times from a block of random to a block of sequenced trials), the
      dyslexic group did not. These data suggest that implicit motor learning deficits 
      may underlie the laborious learning seen in developmental dyslexia. Because
      garden-variety poor readers were as able as control children to use the sequence 
      cues to achieve better task performance, there may be differences in how
      garden-variety poor readers and dyslexic children acquire knowledge. This has
      important implications for remediation programs that are specific to children
      with dyslexia and for distinguishing among varieties of poor readers.

AB  - Beyond the reading-related deficits typical of developmental dyslexia (DD),
      recent evidence suggests that individuals afflicted with this condition also show
      difficulties in motor sequence learning. To date, however, little is known with
      respect to the characteristics of the learning impairments, nor to the neural
      correlates associated with this type of procedural deficit in DD patients. Here, 
      we first summarize the results of the few behavioral and brain imaging studies
      that have investigated the effects of DD on motor sequence learning. To help
      guide research in this field, we then discuss relevant psychophysical and
      neuroimaging work conducted in healthy volunteers in relation to three different 
      conceptual perspectives: when, how, and what. More specifically, we examine the
      cognitive boundaries that affect performance across the different stages of
      learning (i.e., "when"), the different cognitive processes (i.e., "how") under
      which learning occurs, and the mental representations (i.e., "what") that are
      elicited when acquiring this type of skilled behavior. It is hoped that this
      conceptual framework will be useful to researchers interested in further studying
      the nature of the motor learning impairment reported in DD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of word length and several sublexical, and
      lexico-semantic variables on the reading of Italian children with a developmental
      reading deficit. BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated the role of word length
      in transparent orthographies. However, several factors that may interact with
      word length were not controlled for. METHODS: Seventeen impaired and 34 skilled
      sixth-grade readers were presented words of different lengths, matched for
      initial phoneme, bigram frequency, word frequency, age of acquisition, and
      imageability. Participants were asked to read aloud, as quickly and as accurately
      as possible. Reaction times at the onset of pronunciation and mispronunciations
      were recorded. RESULTS: Impaired readers' reaction times indicated a marked
      effect of word length; in skilled readers, there was no length effect for short
      words but, rather, a monotonic increase from 6-letter words on. Regression
      analyses confirmed the role of word length and indicated the influence of word
      frequency (similar in impaired and skilled readers). No other variables predicted
      reading latencies. CONCLUSIONS: Word length differentially influenced word
      recognition in impaired versus skilled readers, irrespective of the action of
      (potentially interfering) sublexical, lexical, and semantic variables. It is
      proposed that the locus of the length effect is at a perceptual level of
      analysis. The independent influence of word frequency on the reading performance 
      of both groups of participants indicates the sparing of lexical activation in
      impaired readers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify quantitative and qualitative
      differences between the reading and writing skills of children with developmental
      dyslexia and those of dyslexic children with a specific language impairment
      (SLI). BACKGROUND: It is suggested that although the etiology of developmental
      dyslexia and SLI may be diverse, dyslexic children with SLI and their
      language-intact peers are comparable on a behavioral level. METHODS: Three groups
      of second-grade children were compared on reading and writing tests with single
      words and nonwords: 15 dyslexic children with a history of SLI (SLI group), 15
      dyslexic children with a typical pattern of language development (non-SLI group),
      and a control group of 30 children with no clinical history of learning
      disabilities or communication disorders. RESULTS: Analysis of the results
      revealed the performances of both SLI and non-SLI dyslexic groups to be
      comparable in terms of speed, accuracy, and error typology. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study confirms that there are parallels between dyslexic children with language
      disorders and their dyslexic peers with intact language skills, at least in terms
      of their performance on reading and writing tests.

TI  - Elucidating the component processes involved in dyslexic and non-dyslexic reading
      fluency: an eye-tracking study.

AB  - The relationship between rapid automatized naming (RAN) and reading fluency is
      well documented (see Wolf, M. & Bowers, P.G. (1999). The double-deficit
      hypothesis for the developmental dyslexias. Journal of Educational Psychology,
      91(3), 415-438, for a review), but little is known about which component
      processes are important in RAN, and why developmental dyslexics show longer
      latencies on these tasks. Researchers disagree as to whether these delays are
      caused by impaired phonological processing or whether extra-phonological
      processes also play a role (e.g., Clarke, P., Hulme, C., & Snowling, M. (2005).
      Individual differences in RAN and reading: a response timing analysis. Journal of
      Research in Reading, 28(2), 73-86; Wolf, M., Bowers, P.G., & Biddle, K. (2000).
      Naming-speed processes, timing, and reading: a conceptual review. Journal of
      learning disabilities, 33(4), 387-407). We conducted an eye-tracking study that
      manipulated phonological and visual information (as representative of
      extra-phonological processes) in RAN. Results from linear mixed (LME) effects
      analyses showed that both phonological and visual processes influence
      naming-speed for both dyslexic and non-dyslexic groups, but the influence on
      dyslexic readers is greater. Moreover, dyslexic readers' difficulties in these
      domains primarily emerge in a measure that explicitly includes the production
      phase of naming. This study elucidates processes underpinning RAN performance in 
      non-dyslexic readers and pinpoints areas of difficulty for dyslexic readers. We
      discuss these findings with reference to phonological and extra-phonological
      hypotheses of naming-speed deficits.

AB  - At present, more and more researchers are applying tested
      mathematical-engineering methods into different domains of life. One of these
      areas is helping people with different forms of disabilities. Research in this
      area is focused on searching for the relation between clinical and
      electrophysiological symptoms of children with developmental dysphasia. Sleep EEG
      and speech analyses are the primary areas under discussion, while the finding of 
      methods acceptable for improvement of the diagnosis and determination of
      therapeutic procedures is the research topic. It is possible to reduce
      fundamentally, or to cure optimally these disorders in advanced diagnosis.
      Therefore it is important to search for new methods and to combine what has been 
      used separately till now.

AB  - During brain development cells divide, differentiate and migrate to their
      assigned targets to form synapses and active cell assemblies. This sequence is
      controlled both by genetic programs and environmental factors. Alterations of
      this sequence by mutations or environmental insults leads to the formation of
      misconnected circuits endowed with a 'pre-symptomatic signature'. I propose here 
      that early- and late-onset neurological disorders as diverse as infantile
      epilepsies, mental retardation, dyslexia or, in certain conditions, even
      Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease might be, in part, born at early
      developmental stages before symptoms appear. The core of this working hypothesis 
      is that imaging or non-invasive recordings might unravel signatures of disorders 
      to come, thereby permitting earlier diagnosis and potential treatment of
      neurological disorders.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess binocular control in children with dyslexia. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional study with 26 children who were submitted to a set of
      ophthalmologic and visual tests. RESULTS: In the dyslexic children less eye
      movement control in voluntary convergence and unstable binocular fixation was
      observed. CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that developmental
      dyslexia might present deficits which involve the magnocellular pathway and a
      part of the posterior cortical attentional network.

TI  - Rapid naming deficits in dyslexia: a stumbling block for the perceptual anchor
      theory of dyslexia.
PG  - F40-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00752.x [doi]
AB  - According to a recent theory of dyslexia, the perceptual anchor theory, children 
      with dyslexia show deficits in classic auditory and phonological tasks not
      because they have auditory or phonological impairments but because they are
      unable to form a 'perceptual anchor' in tasks that rely on a small set of
      repeated stimuli. The theory makes the strong prediction that rapid naming
      deficits should only be present in small sets of repeated items, not in large
      sets of unrepeated items. The present research tested this prediction by
      comparing rapid naming performance of a small set of repeated items with that of 
      a large set of unrepeated items. The results were unequivocal. Deficits were
      found both for small and large sets of objects and numbers. The deficit was
      actually bigger for large sets than for small sets, which is the opposite of the 
      prediction made by the anchor theory. In conclusion, the perceptual anchor theory
      does not provide a satisfactory account of some of the major hallmark effects of 
      developmental dyslexia.

      understanding childhood neuropsychiatric disorders.
PG  - 1233-51
LID - 10.1097/CHI.0b013e318185e703 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the maturational events that occur during prenatal and
      postnatal brain development and to present neuroimaging findings from studies of 
      healthy individuals that identify the trajectories of normal brain development.
      METHOD: Histological and postmortem findings of early brain development are
      presented, followed by a discussion of anatomical, diffusion tensor, proton
      spectroscopy, and functional imaging findings from studies of healthy
      individuals, with special emphasis on longitudinal data. RESULTS: Early brain
      development occurs through a sequence of major events, beginning with the
      formation of the neural tube and ending with myelination. Brain development at a 
      macroscopic level typically proceeds first in sensorimotor areas, spreading
      subsequently and progressively into dorsal and parietal, superior temporal, and
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortices throughout later childhood and adolescence.
      These patterns of anatomical development parallel increasing activity in frontal 
      cortices that subserves the development of higher-order cognitive functions
      during late childhood and adolescence. Disturbances in these developmental
      patterns seem to be involved centrally in the pathogenesis of various childhood
      psychiatric disorders including childhood-onset schizophrenia,
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental dyslexia, Tourette's
      syndrome, and bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Advances in imaging techniques have 
      enhanced our understanding of normal developmental trajectories in the brain,
      which may improve insight into the abnormal patterns of development in various
      childhood psychiatric disorders.

LID - 10.1177/0022219408317856 [doi]
AB  - This article examines working memory functioning in children with specific
      developmental disorders of scholastic skills as defined by ICD-10. Ninety-seven
      second to fourth graders with a minimum IQ of 80 are compared using a 2 x 2
      factorial (dyscalculia vs. no dyscalculia; dyslexia vs. no dyslexia) design. An
      extensive test battery assesses the three subcomponents of working memory
      described by Baddeley (1986): phonological loop, visual-spatial sketchpad, and
      central executive. Children with dyscalculia show deficits in visual-spatial
      memory; children with dyslexia show deficits in phonological and central
      executive functioning. When controlling for the influence of the phonological
      loop on the performance of the central executive, however, the effect is no
      longer significant. Although children with both reading and arithmetic disorders 
      are consistently outperformed by all other groups, there is no significant
      interaction between the factors dyscalculia and dyslexia.

      recognition.
PG  - 445-51
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.03.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide the first systematic in-depth description of the
      consequences of developmental prosopagnosia (DP; 'face blindness') for
      psychosocial functioning and occupational disability, in order to determine what 
      kind of professional intervention may be needed. METHODS: Semi-structured
      telephone interviews were carried out with 25 people whose self-reports of face
      recognition problems were confirmed by impaired scores on the Cambridge Face
      Recognition Test. Thematic analysis was used to inductively identify and
      understand common psychosocial consequences of DP. RESULTS: All participants
      described recurrent and sometimes traumatic social interaction difficulties
      caused by recognition problems, such as failing to recognize close friends, work 
      colleagues, and family members. These problems often led to chronic anxiety about
      offending others and feelings of embarrassment, guilt, and failure. Most
      participants described some degree of fear and avoidance of social situations in 
      which face recognition was important, including family and social gatherings, and
      meetings at work. Long-term consequences could include dependence on others, a
      restricted social circle, more limited employment opportunities, and loss of
      self-confidence. CONCLUSION: The potential for negative psychosocial consequences
      and occupational disability posed by DP is as great as that posed by conditions
      which are currently afforded professional recognition and support, such as
      stuttering and dyslexia. Wider recognition of the problems prosopagnosia can
      cause could reduce anxiety about social interaction difficulties by making it
      easier to explain and justify recognition problems to other people, including
      employers. Greater professional awareness could facilitate detection and referral
      of those requiring support with coping with social interactions.

AB  - Cor triatriatum (CT) is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a
      fibromuscular membrane that divides the left atrium into two distinct chambers
      and mostly manifests during infancy mimicking mitral valve stenosis. We present
      the uncommon case of cardioembolic ischemic stroke in an adult man on the grounds
      of an otherwise asymptomatic CT with intra-atrial thrombus formation, which was
      established by means of transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging. Because exact diagnosis and surgical treatment is feasible, we
      suggest CT as a rare, but potentially treatable source of cerebral embolism in
      adult patients with stroke and dilatated left atrium.

AB  - Intracranial arachnoid cysts (ACs) are usually asymptomatic, benign developmental
      anomalies. The most frequent clinical manifestations are cranial expansion,
      hydrocephaly, headache, epileptic seizures, psychomotor retardation, and aphasia.
      It is unknown whether there is a correlation between intracranial AC and
      epileptic seizures without obvious intracranial pressure signs. In vivo magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy is a technique used for the noninvasive investigation of
      the various metabolites of cerebral biochemical reactions. Magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy is also being used increasingly commonly in epileptogenic situations
      as a noninvasive technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proton 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopic pattern of the contents of tissue adjacent to AC
      and to determine whether there are any characteristic spectral patterns that may 
      be helpful in evaluating whether these lesions are epileptogenic foci. In
      conclusion, although the number of cases was limited, this finding may be seen as
      indicating that there is no association between AC and epilepsy.

TI  - The contribution of white and gray matter differences to developmental dyslexia: 
      insights from DTI and VBM at 3.0 T.
PG  - 3170-8
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.07.015 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is one of the most common neuropsychological disorders in 
      children and adults. Only few data are available on the pathomechanisms of this
      specific dysfunction, assuming--among others--that dyslexia might be a
      disconnection syndrome of anterior and posterior brain regions involved in
      phonological and orthographic aspects of the reading process, as well as in the
      integration of phonemes and graphemes. Therefore, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used to verify the hypothesis of altered
      white and gray matter structure in German dyslexic adults. DTI revealed decreased
      fractional anisotropy (FA) in bilateral fronto-temporal and left temporo-parietal
      white matter regions (inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus). Significant
      correlations between white matter anisotropy and speed of pseudoword reading were
      found. In dyslexics, gray matter volumes (as measured by VBM) were reduced in the
      superior temporal gyrus of both hemispheres. So far, our results, based on a
      combined analysis of white and gray matter abnormalities, provide exceedingly
      strong evidence for a disconnection syndrome or dysfunction of cortical areas
      relevant for reading and spelling. Thus, we suggest that this imbalance of
      neuronal communication between the respective brain areas might be the crucial
      point for the development of dyslexia.

TI  - [Speech perception development in children with dyslexia].
PG  - 678-83
AB  - Several studies have indicated that dyslexics show a deficit in speech perception
      (SP). The main purpose of this research is to determine the development of SP in 
      dyslexics and normal readers paired by grades from 2nd to 6th grade of primary
      school and to know whether the phonetic contrasts that are relevant for SP change
      during development, taking into account the individual differences. The
      achievement of both groups was compared in the phonetic tasks: voicing contrast, 
      place of articulation contrast and manner of articulation contrast. The results
      showed that the dyslexic performed poorer than the normal readers in SP. In place
      of articulation contrast, the developmental pattern is similar in both groups but
      not in voicing and manner of articulation. Manner of articulation has more
      influence on SP, and its development is higher than the other contrast tasks in
      both groups.

AB  - The present study used delta EEG band to test the hypothesis of a cerebral
      maturational delay and a functional altered cerebral asymmetry for phonological
      processing in dyslexic children. A group of 14 children with dyslexia and 28
      matched controls participated in a linguistic paradigm in which the same words
      were processed in three tasks: phonological, semantic, and orthographic. Delta
      amplitude was computed as an index of cortical inhibition in four different
      phases of word processing. In anterior sites, controls showed left activation
      (reduced delta) during the phonological task and bilateral activation in the
      other two tasks. Conversely, children with dyslexia showed greater overall delta 
      amplitude, indexing a cerebral maturation delay and an altered language
      laterality pattern. In the phonological task they had larger left anterior delta 
      (inhibition of left frontal linguistic locations) and smaller left posterior
      delta amplitude (activation of left posterior sites silent in controls). Results 
      support the phonological deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia and the
      validity of EEG delta band as functional and clinical measure of language
      laterality.

PG  - 571-6
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.02.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited success has been achieved through previous
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) linkage scans, which were all
      designed to map genes underlying the dichotomous phenotype. The International
      Multi-centre ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) project performed a whole genome linkage scan 
      specifically designed to map ADHD quantitative trait loci (QTL). METHODS: A set
      of 1094 single selected Caucasian ADHD nuclear families was genotyped on a highly
      accurate and informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel. Two
      quantitative traits measuring the children's symptoms in home and school settings
      were collected and standardized according to a population sample of 8000 children
      to reflect the developmental nature and gender prevalence difference of ADHD.
      Univariate linkage test was performed on both traits and their mean score.
      RESULTS: A significant common linkage locus was found at chromosome 1p36 with a
      locus-specific heritability of 5.1% and a genomewide empirical p < .04.
      Setting-specific suggestive linkage signals were also found: logarithm of odds
      (LOD) = 2.2 at 9p23 for home trait and LOD = 2.6 at 11q21 for school trait.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that given large samples with proper
      phenotypic measures, searching for ADHD genes with a QTL strategy is an important
      alternative to using the clinical diagnosis. The fact that our linkage region
      1p36 overlaps with the dyslexia QTL DYX8 further suggests it is potentially a
      pleiotropic locus for ADHD and dyslexia.

AB  - Although the dominant view posits that developmental dyslexia arises from a
      deficit in phonological processing and memory, efficient phonological decoding
      requires precise visual selection of graphemes. Therefore, visual engagement and 
      disengagement of non-spatial attention were studied in 13 dyslexic children and
      13 chronological age and intelligence quotient (IQ) matched normally reading
      children by measuring "attentional masking" (AM) and "attentional blink" (AB)
      effects. AM refers to an impaired identification of the first (T1) of two rapidly
      sequential targets (i.e., attentional engagement). In contrast, AB refers to an
      impaired identification of the second target in the sequence (T2; i.e.,
      attentional disengagement). The results revealed a specific temporal deficit of
      AM as well as of AB in dyslexic children. Our results showed that the abnormality
      in AM and AB is rather widespread, since 77% and 54% of dyslexic children
      deviated at least 1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean of the controls,
      respectively, for the two deficits. We further showed that individual differences
      in non-spatial attention were specifically related to nonword reading ability.
      These results suggest that non-spatial attention deficits (possibly related to a 
      parietal cortex dysfunction) may selectively impair the reading development via
      sub-lexical mechanisms.

AB  - Individuals with surface dyslexia read via grapheme-to-phoneme conversion due to 
      a deficit in the lexical route. A deficit in the lexical route can be caused by
      impairments at several different loci. In the current study we identify three
      subtypes of developmental surface dyslexia, each caused by impairment at a
      different locus on the lexical route, and each showing a different pattern of
      performance in various tasks. All three subtypes show the classical pattern of
      reading aloud, with regularizations and difficulty in reading words that have
      more than a single possible conversion to a phoneme string, but they differ in
      their performance in lexical decision and homophone comprehension. The first
      subtype, input surface dyslexia, results from a deficit to the orthographic input
      lexicon, and entails poor performance in lexical decision and comprehension
      tasks. The second subtype, orthographic lexicon output surface dyslexia, in which
      the orthographic input lexicon is accessible but its output to the phonological
      output lexicon and to the semantic system is impaired, allows normal lexical
      decision, but causes impaired comprehension of homophones. The third subtype,
      interlexical surface dyslexia, caused by a selective deficit in the connection
      between the orthographic input lexicon and the phonological output lexicon but
      with intact access from the orthographic input lexicon to the semantic system,
      allows normal performance in lexical decision and comprehension tasks. Seventeen 
      Hebrew-speaking individuals with developmental surface dyslexia aged 10-43
      participated in the study, eight of them showed the first pattern, three showed
      the second pattern, and six displayed the third pattern. Another result of the
      study pertains to the importance of the lexicality of the result of
      grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for each target word. Some words, when read via
      grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, can potentially be read as other words (such as
      "now" in English, which can be sounded as the word "know"), we term these words
      potentiophones. The results indicate that potentiophones yield the highest error 
      rate in reading aloud for all the participants with surface dyslexia.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that children suffering from developmental dyslexia
      have a deficit in categorical perception of speech sounds. The aim of the current
      study was to better understand the nature of this categorical perception deficit.
      In this study, categorical perception skills of children with dyslexia were
      compared with those of chronological age and reading level controls. Children
      identified and discriminated /do-to/ syllables along a voice onset time (VOT)
      continuum. Results showed that children with dyslexia discriminated among
      phonemically contrastive pairs less accurately than did chronological age and
      reading level controls and also showed higher sensitivity in the discrimination
      of allophonic contrasts. These results suggest that children with dyslexia
      perceive speech with allophonic units rather than phonemic units. The origin of
      allophonic perception in the course of perceptual development and its implication
      for reading acquisition are discussed.

PG  - 1494-506

AB  - Reading disability is a relatively common developmental disorder, the aetiology
      of which is clouded by conflicting theoretical approaches and the heterogeneity
      of the subtypes found. Recent advances in understanding of the visual system have
      revived interest in the role of visual processing in the persisting inability to 
      read fluently that characterises dyslexia. A new integrated model of visual
      processing based on primate single cell and human electrophysiology may provide
      such a framework, implicating the magnocellular pathway's role in activating and 
      driving attentional mechanisms in higher order cortical regions. In particular,
      the recent introduction of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to create
      'transient lesions' may provide causal evidence for dorsal stream
      feedforward/feedback involvement in rapid visual processing tasks. Such
      organization is argued to be crucial for the development of fluent reading.

AB  - BACKGROUND: an audio-visual computerized remediation program in students with
      developmental dyslexia. AIM: to verify the efficacy of an audio-visual
      computerized remediation program in students with developmental dyslexia. The
      specific goals of this study involved the comparison of the linguistic-cognitive 
      performance of students with developmental dyslexia with that of students
      considered good readers; to compare the results obtained in pre and post-testing 
      situations of students with dyslexia who were and were not submitted to the
      program; and to compare the results obtained with the remediation program in
      students with developmental dyslexia to those obtained in good readers. METHODS: 
      the participants of this study were 20 students who were divided as follows:
      group I (GI) subdivided in: GIe (five students with developmental dyslexia who
      were submitted to the program) and GIc (five students with developmental dyslexia
      who were not submitted to the program); group II (GII) was subdivided in: GIIe
      (five good readers who were submitted to the program) and GIIc (five good readers
      who were not submitted to the program). An audio-visual computerized remediation 
      program was used--'Play on'. RESULTS: results indicate that GI presented a lower 
      performance in auditory processing and phonological awareness when compared to
      GII in the pre-testing situation. However, GIe presented a similar performance to
      that of GII in the post-testing situation, indicating the effectiveness of the
      audio-visual remediation program in students with developmental dyslexia.
      CONCLUSION: this study made evident the effectiveness of an audio-visual
      remediation program in students with developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Lexical and nonlexical processing in developmental dyslexia: a case for different
      resources and different impairments.
PG  - 798-830
LID - 10.1080/02643290802347183 [doi]
AB  - In a group of adult dyslexics word reading and, especially, word spelling are
      predicted more by what we have called lexical learning (tapped by a
      paired-associate task with pictures and written nonwords) than by phonological
      skills. Nonword reading and spelling, instead, are not associated with this task 
      but they are predicted by phonological tasks. Consistently, surface and
      phonological dyslexics show opposite profiles on lexical learning and
      phonological tasks. The phonological dyslexics are more impaired on the
      phonological tasks, while the surface dyslexics are equally or more impaired on
      the lexical learning tasks. Finally, orthographic lexical learning explains more 
      variation in spelling than in reading, and subtyping based on spelling returns
      more interpretable results than that based on reading. These results suggest that
      the quality of lexical representations is crucial to adult literacy skills. This 
      is best measured by spelling and best predicted by a task of lexical learning. We
      hypothesize that lexical learning taps a uniquely human capacity to form new
      representations by recombining the units of a restricted set.

TI  - [Attempt for development of rapid word reading test for children--evaluation of
      reliability and validity].
PG  - 363-9
AB  - We developed a rapid word reading test for examining the phonological processing 
      ability of Japanese children. We prepared two versions of the test, version A and
      B. Each test has word and non-word tasks. Twenty-two healthy boys of third grade 
      in primary schools participated in this validation study. For criterion related
      validity, we performed the serial Hiragana reading test, the sentence reading
      test, Raven's coloured progressive matrices (RCPM), the Token test for children, 
      the Kana word dictation test, the standardized comprehension test of abstract
      words (SCTAW), and Trail Circle test. The reading times of the newly developed
      test correlated moderately or highly with those of the serial Hiragana reading
      test and the sentence reading test. However, the scores of the other tests (RCPM,
      Token test for children, Kana word dictation test, SCTAW, Trail Circle test) did 
      not correlated with the reading time of the rapid word reading test. Test-retest 
      reliabilities in the word tasks were more than moderate: 0.52 and 0.76 in
      versions A and B, while those in the non-word tasks were high: 0.91 and 0.88 in
      versions A and B. The correlation coefficient between versions A and B was 0.7
      for the word tasks and 0.92 for the non-word tasks. This study showed that the
      rapid word reading test has substantial validity and reliability for testing the 
      phonological processing ability of Japanese children. In addition, the non-word
      tasks were more suitable for selectively examining the speed of the grapheme to
      phoneme conversion process.

AB  - The current study was conducted to test the premise that computer-based
      intervention that targets auditory temporal processing combined with language
      exercises (Fast ForWord) is effective in remediating children with disorders of
      language and reading. Sixty-five middle school struggling readers were randomly
      assigned to one of five groups and over a 12-week-period received one of the
      following interventions: (1) two phases of intervention with Fast ForWord (FFW,
      experimental group), (2) two phases of intervention with SuccessMaker (SM, active
      control group), (3) FFW followed by SM, (4) SM followed by FFW, or (5) no
      intervention beyond the regular class curriculum (developmental control group).
      Changes in reading, phonemic awareness, spelling and language skills were
      assessed via a repeated measures MANOVA. Results indicated significant
      within-subjects effects (i.e., change for all participants over time), but no
      between-subject group differences, failing to show that Fast ForWord resulted in 
      any gains over and above those seen in the other groups.

TI  - Dyslexia and developmental co-ordination disorder in further and higher

      given?
PG  - 197-213

AB  - Developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD) is a developmental disorder affecting 
      motor co-ordination. The Diagnostics Statistics Manual-IV classification for DCD 
      describes difficulties across a range of activities of daily living, impacting on
      everyday skills and academic performance in school. Recent evidence has shown
      that difficulties persist into adulthood. As a consequence, increasing numbers of
      students are arriving at university and colleges in the UK with a diagnosis of
      DCD and requesting Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA) to gain support. This
      preliminary study examined a cohort of 115 students currently in further or
      higher education in order to compare and contrast similarities and differences in
      three subgroups: those with a diagnosis of DCD, a second group with DCD and
      dyslexia and a third group with dyslexia only. It examines how students were
      supported in the past and now as students. Additionally it identifies differences
      in reported strengths and difficulties. A higher percentage of those with
      dyslexia receive DSA. All students have similar types of support not dependent on
      their diagnosis. The DCD only group lives at home with parents more and has a
      significantly greater reported motor and executive functioning difficulty than
      the other two groups.

PG  - 1241-9
AB  - Cognitive performance and the relationship between theory of mind (TOM), weak
      central coherence and executive function were investigated in a cohort of young
      people with additional learning needs. Participants were categorized by social
      communication questionnaire score into groups of 10 individuals within the
      autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) range, 14 within the pervasive developmental
      disorder range and 18 with few autistic traits. The ASD group were significantly 
      poorer than the other groups on a test of cognitive flexibility. In the ASD group
      only, there was a strong relationship between executive performance and TOM which
      remained after controlling for IQ. Our findings suggest that the relationship
      between cognitive traits may more reliably distinguish autism than the presence
      of individual deficits alone.

AB  - A large body of research has reported visual perception deficits in both people
      with dyslexia and autistic spectrum disorders. In this study, we compared form
      and motion coherence detection between a group of adults with high-functioning
      autism, a group with Asperger's disorder, a group with dyslexia, and a matched
      control group. It was found that motion detection was intact in dyslexia and
      Asperger. Individuals with high-functioning autism showed a general impaired
      ability to detect coherent form and motion. Participants with Asperger's syndrome
      showed lower form coherence thresholds than the dyslexic and normally developing 
      adults. The results are discussed with respect to the involvement of the dorsal
      and ventral pathways in developmental disorders.

AB  - Neurologic and radiologic findings in children with well-defined developmental
      language impairment have rarely been systematically assessed. Children aged 7 to 
      13 years with developmental language impairment or normal language (controls)
      underwent language, nonverbal cognitive, motor and neurological assessments,
      standardized assessment for subtle neurological signs, and magnetic resonance
      imaging. Nine children with developmental language impairment and 12 controls
      participated. No focal abnormalities were identified on standard neurological
      examination. Age and developmental language impairment were independent
      predictors of neurological subtle signs scores (r(2) = 0.52). Imaging
      abnormalities were identified in two boys with developmental language impairment 
      and no controls (P = .17). Lesions identified were predicted neither by history
      nor by neurological examination. Previously unsuspected lesions were identified
      in almost 25% of children with developmental language impairment. Constraints
      regarding cooperation and sedation requirements may limit the clinical
      application of imaging modalities in this population.

AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia could provide a promising model for the study of
      the effects of hormones on cognition. The aim of this study was to assess sexual 
      dimorphic abilities related to oral language, spatial abilities, and verbal
      fluency and to determine the existence of learning disabilities in 11 congenital 
      girls with adrenal hyperplasia compared with 11 healthy girls. Both groups
      underwent a neuropsychological evaluation using the Child Neuropsychological
      Assessment battery for Spanish-speaking children. Results showed that the
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia group had a significantly lower performance than
      the control group in the repetition and expression domains, right-left
      comprehension task, and verbal semantic fluency task. A higher incidence of
      learning disabilities (predominantly reading related) in the patient group
      compared with their controls was also evident. Thus, the presence of weak verbal 
      areas along with a high incidence of learning disabilities related primarily,
      though not exclusively, to reading was documented in these girls.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine development of sensitivity to auditory and visual temporal
      processes in children and the association with standardized measures of auditory 
      processing and communication. Methods Normative data on tests of visual and
      auditory processing were collected on 18 adults and 98 children aged 6-10 years
      of age. Auditory processes included detection of pitch from temporal cues using
      iterated rippled noise and frequency modulation detection at 2 Hz, 40 Hz, and 240
      Hz. Visual processes were coherent form and coherent motion detection.
      Test-retest data were gathered on 21 children. RESULTS: Performance on perceptual
      tasks improved with age, except for fine temporal processing (iterated rippled
      noise) and coherent form perception, both of which were relatively stable over
      the age range. Within-subject variability (as assessed by track width) did not
      account for age-related change. There was no evidence for a common temporal
      processing factor, and there were no significant associations between perceptual 
      task performance and communication level (Children's Communication Checklist, 2nd
      ed.; D. V. M. Bishop, 2003) or speech-based auditory processing (SCAN-C; R. W.
      Keith, 2000). CONCLUSIONS: The auditory tasks had different developmental
      trajectories despite a common procedure, indicating that age-related change was
      not solely due to responsiveness to task demands. The 2-Hz frequency modulation
      detection task, previously used in dyslexia research, and the visual tasks had
      low reliability compared to other measures.

PG  - 1652-63
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2008.02.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The human auditory cortex codes speech temporally according to
      sequential acoustico-phonetic cues like the voice onset time (VOT). This coding
      is predominantly left-lateralized in normal readers. We examined VOT-processing
      asymmetries in adults with a history of developmental dyslexia (DD-history+).
      METHODS: Auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) to voiced (/ba/) and voiceless (/pa/) 
      speech stimuli were recorded from 10 DD-history+ adults and 8 controls. Source
      modelling of the "release component" (RC: approximately 240 ms; time-locked to
      voiced consonantal release and considered reflective of VOT-processing) was
      conducted to explore VOT asymmetries. RESULTS: Controls demonstrated L>R RC
      source probe amplitude asymmetry in the auditory cortex. DD-history+ subjects
      with little persistent reading deficit (n=5) demonstrated normal temporal coding 
      but rightward asymmetry. DD-history+ subjects with severe persistent deficits
      (n=5) exhibited numerous supplemental AEP components (notably left hemispheric)
      and inconsistent asymmetry (leftward or alternating). CONCLUSIONS: These
      preliminary findings suggest that DD-history+ adults process auditory speech cues
      differently than adults without previous DD. The nature of this processing may
      relate to the severity of persistent reading deficits. SIGNIFICANCE: Previous
      dyslexics with little persistent deficit can exhibit atypical functional
      asymmetry with normal auditory temporal coding. Source modelling represents an
      effective, non-invasive means of exploring processing asymmetries in clinical
      populations.

AB  - Normally reading adults (N = 15) and primary school children (N = 24) and two
      diagnostic subgroups of children with developmental dyslexia (N = 21)-all native 
      German speakers-performed a successive same-different task with pairs of letters 
      and nonletters (pseudoletters or geometrical shapes). The first item of a pair
      was always presented on its own, and the second either on its own or surrounded
      by a congruent or incongruent nontarget shape. Adults showed congruence effects
      with nonletters but not with letters, and children with both types of stimuli.
      Frequent-word reading-impaired dyslexics (N = 11) in addition showed dramatically
      slower overall reaction times. Nonword reading-impaired dyslexics (N = 10) showed
      congruence effects with nonletters but negative congruence effects with letters. 
      The results support the notion that normal readers have established a special
      visual processing strategy for letters. Processing speed rather than reading
      expertise seems crucial for this strategy to emerge. The contrasting effects
      between subgroups of dyslexics reveal specific underlying deficits.

      with autosomal dominant inheritance and screening of candidate loci.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a familial epileptic condition combining a peculiar
      electro-clinical pattern with developmental language dysfunction in a large
      Italian kindred. METHODS: We studied the clinical and neurophysiological features
      of a 4-generation family with 10 affected members (3 deceased). We also analysed 
      in 7 affected and 7 healthy members microsatellite markers for 51 candidate loci 
      for epilepsy, including 42 loci containing ion channel genes expressed in the
      brain, as well as the SPCH1 and SRPX2 loci. RESULTS: Five of the seven living
      affected members (aged 20-58 years) had the full phenotype (seizures, EEG
      epileptiform abnormalities and dysphasia). The language dysfunction was the first
      symptom, becoming evident since the period of language development and mainly
      consisting of phonemic and syntactic paraphasias, difficulty of expression and
      reduced verbal fluency. The seizures had their onset between 2 and 23 years and
      were reported as epileptic falls (4) associated or not with myoclonic features,
      absences (3), tonic-clonic (1) and complex partial seizures (1). The seizures
      were easily controlled by antiepileptic treatment in all patients except one. In 
      the five patients with a good response of seizures to treatment, the EEG tracings
      showed the coexistence of focal and generalized epileptiform abnormalities; in
      the refractory patient the interictal EEG demonstrated bilateral asynchronous
      fronto-temporal paroxysms with left predominance and ictal SEEG recording
      suggested a multifocal origin of the discharges. MRI of the brain was normal in
      all patients. Linkage analysis provided negative LOD scores for all the
      investigated loci. CONCLUSION: We have described a novel familial pattern of
      epilepsy and developmental dysphasia which is not genetically linked to epilepsy 
      or speech disorder loci, as documented by a candidate-gene linkage approach.

AB  - According to several studies auditory discrimination as measured by mismatch
      negativity (MMN) is compromised in participants with reading disorder. However,
      studies on duration discrimination have produced conflicting findings [Baldeweg, 
      T., Richardson, A., Watkins, S., Foale, C., & Gruzelier, J., 1999. Impaired
      auditory frequency discrimination in dyslexia detected with mismatch evoked
      potentials. Annals of Neurology, 4, 1-9; Corbera, S., Escera, C., & Artigas, J., 
      2006. Impaired duration mismatch negativity in developmental dyslexia.
      Neuroreport, 17, 1051-1055]. Auditory sensitivity has not been as actively
      investigated among children with attention deficit, although attention problems
      often co-occur with dyslexia. The present study is a reanalysis of MMN data
      gathered from control children and children with reading disorder (RD) and/or
      attention deficit (AD). In our previous analysis [Huttunen, T., Halonen, A.,
      Kaartinen, J. & Lyytinen, H., 2007. Does mismatch negativity show differences in 
      reading disabled children as compared to normal children and children with
      attention deficit? Developmental Neuropsychology, 31, 453-470.], the only
      significant difference between the groups was in the lateralization of the MMNs
      in the RD and the control group: the MMNs of the RD group were more pronounced
      over the left hemisphere, while those of the control group appeared larger over
      the right hemisphere. A reanalysis was conducted to study whether the group
      definition criteria and/or overlap of the attention and reading deficits in the
      AD group might have affected the results. For this purpose participants were
      divided to four groups: control children, children with RD, children with AD, and
      children with both RD and AD. MMN was elicited by duration deviations in a
      continuous sound. Significant differences were observed in the MMN peaks between 
      the control group and all clinical groups: the MMNs were diminished in the right 
      hemisphere in the RD group, in all frontal and central channels in the RD+AD
      group, and the MMN peaks appeared earlier in frontal channels in the AD group.

AB  - Experiment 1: Hierarchical linear modeling of growth trajectories of three
      executive functions (inhibition; rapid automatic switching, RAS; and combined
      inhibition/switching) in typical readers and writers showed steady improvement of
      inhibition but leveling of RAS and inhibition/switching about fourth grade. In
      multiple regressions, RAS, entered after inhibition, contributed uniquely to
      literacy outcomes at every grade. Improvement of executive functions over the
      first four grades predicted literacy outcomes at fourth grade. Experiment 2: For 
      children with dyslexia, executive functions explained less variance in literacy
      outcomes, and boys were worse in inhibition and inhibition/switching.
      Developmental, educational, and clinical significance of findings are discussed.

      fMRI study.
PG  - 629-39
LID - 10.1017/S1355617708080867 [doi]
AB  - Adult readers with developmental phonological dyslexia exhibit significant
      difficulty comparing pseudowords and pure tones in auditory working memory (AWM).
      This suggests deficient AWM skills for adults diagnosed with dyslexia. Despite
      behavioral differences, it is unknown whether neural substrates of AWM differ
      between adults diagnosed with dyslexia and normal readers. Prior neuroimaging of 
      adults diagnosed with dyslexia and normal readers, and post-mortem findings of
      neural structural anomalies in adults diagnosed with dyslexia support the
      hypothesis of atypical neural activity in temporoparietal and inferior frontal
      regions during AWM tasks in adults diagnosed with dyslexia. We used fMRI during
      two binaural AWM tasks (pseudowords or pure tones comparisons) in adults
      diagnosed with dyslexia (n = 11) and normal readers (n = 11). For both AWM tasks,
      adults diagnosed with dyslexia exhibited greater activity in left posterior
      superior temporal (BA 22) and inferior parietal regions (BA 40) than normal
      readers. Comparing neural activity between groups and between stimuli contrasts
      (pseudowords vs. tones), adults diagnosed with dyslexia showed greater primary
      auditory cortex activity (BA 42; tones > pseudowords) than normal readers. Thus, 
      greater activity in primary auditory, posterior superior temporal, and inferior
      parietal cortices during linguistic and non-linguistic AWM tasks for adults
      diagnosed with dyslexia compared to normal readers indicate differences in neural
      substrates of AWM comparison tasks.

PG  - 353-70
LID - 10.1177/0022219407311747 [doi]
AB  - The authors examined second grade reading accuracy and fluency and their
      associations via letter knowledge to phonological and language predictors
      assessed at 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 years in children in the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal
      Study of Dyslexia. Structural equation modeling showed that a developmentally
      highly stable factor (early phonological and language processing [EPLP]) behind
      key dyslexia predictors (i.e., phonological awareness, short-term memory, rapid
      naming, vocabulary, and pseudoword repetition) could already be identified at 3.5
      years. EPLP was significantly associated with reading and spelling accuracy and
      by age with letter knowledge. However, EPLP had only a minor link with reading
      fluency, which was additionally explained by early letter knowledge. The results 
      show that reading accuracy is well predicted by early phonological and language
      skills. Variation in fluent reading skills is not well explained by early skills,
      suggesting factors other than phonological core skills. Future research is
      suggested to explore the factors behind the development of fast and accurate
      decoding skills.

TI  - Quantitative trait locus association scan of early reading disability and ability
      using pooled DNA and 100K SNP microarrays in a sample of 5760 children.
PG  - 729-40
AB  - Quantitative genetic research suggests that reading disability is the
      quantitative extreme of the same genetic and environmental factors responsible
      for normal variation in reading ability. This finding warrants a quantitative
      trait locus (QTL) strategy that compares low versus high extremes of the normal
      distribution of reading in the search for QTLs associated with variation
      throughout the distribution. A low reading ability group (N=755) and a high
      reading group (N=747) were selected from a representative UK sample of
      7-year-olds assessed on two measures of reading that we have shown to be highly
      heritable and highly genetically correlated. The low and high reading ability
      groups were each divided into 10 independent DNA pools and the 20 pools were
      assayed on 100 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to screen for
      the largest allele frequency differences between the low and high reading ability
      groups. Seventy five of these nominated SNPs were individually genotyped in an
      independent sample of low (N=452) and high (N=452) reading ability children
      selected from a second sample of 4258 7-year-olds. Nine of the seventy-five SNPs 
      were nominally significant (P<0.05) in the predicted direction. These 9 SNPs and 
      14 other SNPs showing low versus high allele frequency differences in the
      predicted direction were genotyped in the rest of the second sample to test the
      QTL hypothesis. Ten SNPs yielded nominally significant linear associations in the
      expected direction across the distribution of reading ability. However, none of
      these SNP associations accounted for more than 0.5% of the variance of reading
      ability, despite 99% power to detect them. We conclude that QTL effect sizes,
      even for highly heritable common disorders and quantitative traits such as early 
      reading disability and ability, might be much smaller than previously considered.

TI  - [Tributes to Macdonald Critchley and his achievements in neurolinguistics].
PG  - 127-31
AB  - Macdonald Critchley, a world renowned neurologist, is best remembered as the
      person who challenged to solve the mystery and enigma of higher cerebral
      functions. He was the author of over 200 published articles and 20 books on
      neurology including his pioneer work on developmental dyslexia, the parietal
      lobe, cerebral hemisphere dominance and aphasiology. He also published articles
      on migraine, epilepsy, dementia, visual perseveration, anterior cerebral artery
      syndromes, indifference to pain, sleep disorders, movement disorders, and
      myotonia. He was very erudite and talented in linguistics; his interests were
      broad and eclectic. He wrote extensively on non-medical topics, such as plays,
      horror stories, mythology, and biographies of distinguished neuroscientists,
      philosophers or artists. His articles were written in the elegant prose style
      with thorough reference citations and extensive reviews of the literature
      worldwide. He was born in Bristol in 1900. From an early age, he was fascinated
      with the functioning brain and retained a life-long interest in languages. He was
      appointed to the Consultant staff of the National Hospital, Queen Square, and to 
      King's College Hospital at the age of 27, and was elected to become FRCP at 30.
      He was Dean of the Institute of Neurology from 1948 to 1953. When I was studying 
      advanced neurology at Queen Square in 1960-1961, I was fascinated by his
      outstanding lectures on Huntington's Disease and Non-verbal Communication.
      Although he did not read the manuscripts and used only a few slides for
      illustrations in his lectures, he could describe the details of historical
      accounts and relevant figures. He was an altruistic, instructive teacher with
      keen attention to responses from the audience. His clinical demonstrations,
      teaching rounds and tutorials were hugely popular among postgraduate students
      from all over the world. He emphasized the importance of shrewd observation and
      careful history taking in neurological practice. Macdonald Critchley was
      President of the World Federation of Neurology (1965-1973) and Editor of Journal 
      of the Neurological Sciences. I met him at the 2nd Asian and Oceanian Congress of
      Neurology held in Melbourne in 1967. He was interested to know more about aphasia
      and dyslexia among people speaking and reading Chinese. He kindly invited me to
      speak on 'Linguistic Implications of Chinese Characters' at the meeting of the
      Research Group on Developmental Dyslexia in Dallas. Critchley's prominent
      achievements in teaching, writings and research on neurology derived from his
      creative thinking, powers of shrewd observation, wide knowledge of literature,
      and indefatigable assiduity in scientific pursuits. He died peacefully at home at
      the age of 97 and entered the pantheon of distinguished neuroscientists of the
      20th century.

TI  - Differentiating the neural response to intervention in children with
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1-14

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is associated with functional abnormalities within reading
      areas of the brain. For some children diagnosed with dyslexia, phonologically
      based remediation programs appear to rehabilitate brain function in key reading
      areas (Shaywitz et al., Biological Psychiatry 55: 101-110, 2004; Simos et al.,
      Neuroscience 58: 1203-1213, 2002). However, a non-trivial number of children
      diagnosed with dyslexia fail to respond to these interventions (Torgesen,
      Learning Disabilities Research & Practice 15: 55-64, 2000). A cross-sectional
      fMRI study investigating post-treatment effects was conducted in an effort to
      better understand differences in brain function between treatment responders and 
      non-responders. Educational testing and brain activation measured after treatment
      suggested that the reading intervention used in the present study rehabilitated
      several basic level reading processes in all participants diagnosed with
      dyslexia. However, activation in the left inferior parietal lobe differentiated
      treatment responders and non-responders in comparison to non-impaired readers.
      Children with persistent deficits in single word decoding (treatment
      non-responders) demonstrated significantly less activation in the left inferior
      parietal lobe when compared to non-impaired readers.

      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 15-35
LID - 10.1007/s11881-008-0015-4 [doi]
AB  - This study examined temporal processing in relation to Chinese reading
      acquisition and impairment. The performances of 26 Chinese primary school
      children with developmental dyslexia on tasks of visual and auditory temporal
      order judgement, rapid naming, visual-orthographic knowledge, morphological, and 
      phonological awareness were compared with those of 26 reading level ability
      controls (RL) and 26 chronological age controls (CA). Dyslexic children performed
      worse than the CA group but similar to the RL group on measures of accurate
      processing of auditory and visual-order stimuli, rapid naming, morphological
      awareness, and phonological awareness and a minority performed worse on the two
      temporal processing tasks. However, hierarchical regression analyses revealed
      that visual but not auditory temporal processing contributed unique variance to
      Chinese character recognition even with other cognitive measures controlled,
      suggesting it may be as important a correlate of reading ability in Chinese as in
      alphabetic scripts.

PG  - 321-31; discussion 331-56
LID - 10.1017/S0140525X0800407X [doi]
AB  - Neuroconstructivism: How the Brain Constructs Cognition proposes a unifying
      framework for the study of cognitive development that brings together (1)
      constructivism (which views development as the progressive elaboration of
      increasingly complex structures), (2) cognitive neuroscience (which aims to
      understand the neural mechanisms underlying behavior), and (3) computational
      modeling (which proposes formal and explicit specifications of information
      processing). The guiding principle of our approach is context dependence, within 
      and (in contrast to Marr [1982]) between levels of organization. We propose that 
      three mechanisms guide the emergence of representations: competition,
      cooperation, and chronotopy; which themselves allow for two central processes:
      proactivity and progressive specialization. We suggest that the main outcome of
      development is partial representations, distributed across distinct functional
      circuits. This framework is derived by examining development at the level of
      single neurons, brain systems, and whole organisms. We use the terms encellment, 
      embrainment, and embodiment to describe the higher-level contextual influences
      that act at each of these levels of organization. To illustrate these mechanisms 
      in operation we provide case studies in early visual perception, infant
      habituation, phonological development, and object representations in infancy.
      Three further case studies are concerned with interactions between levels of
      explanation: social development, atypical development and within that,
      developmental dyslexia. We conclude that cognitive development arises from a
      dynamic, contextual change in embodied neural structures leading to partial
      representations across multiple brain regions and timescales, in response to
      proactively specified physical and social environment.

      status.
PG  - 772-84
LID - 10.1044/1092-4388(2008/055) [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Research suggests that children with reading disabilities (RD) have
      difficulty processing temporal and spectral components of sounds. Comodulation
      masking release (CMR) measures a listener's ability to use temporal and spectral 
      information in noise to identify a signal. The purpose of this study was to
      determine whether children with RD had difficulty identifying a signal in CMR
      stimuli. Child and adult performance was compared to assess the development of
      CMR. METHOD: Eighty-one 7- to 10-year-old children (30 with and 51 without RD)
      and 20 adults without RD listened to CMR stimuli through headphones. The
      difference between reference and modulated masker thresholds provided a measure
      of CMR. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that reading status
      did not predict thresholds or CMR. An analysis of variance revealed significantly
      less CMR for children than for adults. CONCLUSIONS: This research does not
      support the hypothesis that children with RD have difficulty processing temporal 
      and spectral auditory information as measured by the CMR paradigm. In contrast
      with some previous research (K. Veloso, J. Hall, & J. Grose, 1990), this study
      suggests that CMR is continuing to develop beyond 10 years of age. Future
      research using a CMR paradigm with older children (10-16 years of age) would
      further illuminate the developmental picture of CMR.

TI  - Language organisation in left perinatal stroke.
PG  - 157-63
LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1085465 [doi]
AB  - Right-hemispheric organisation of language has been observed following early
      left-sided brain lesions. The role of the site of damage is still controversial, 
      as other aspects influence the pattern of speech organisation including timing of
      the lesion and the presence of epilepsy. We studied a group of 10 term-born
      children homogeneous for timing/type of lesion and clinical picture. All subjects
      had left perinatal arterial stroke, right hemiplegia, normal cognitive functions 
      and no or easily controlled epileptic seizures. In half the patients, the lesion 
      clearly involved Broca's area, in the other half it was remote from it. Language 
      lateralization was explored by an fMRI covert rhyme generation task. Eight of 10 
      subjects showed a right lateralisation of language, including all five patients
      with a damaged left Broca and 3/5 of those without it. Group analysis in patients
      with right hemispheric organisation showed brain activations homotopic to those
      found in the left hemisphere of a matched control group. Our findings confirm
      that, at the end of gestation, the human brain exhibits extraordinary
      (re-)organisational capabilities. Language organisation in the right hemisphere
      is favoured by the presence of destructive lesions of the left Broca's area at
      birth, and occurs in brain regions homotopic to those usually involved in
      language processing.

PG  - 139-45
LID - 10.1055/s-0028-1085462 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome (CBPS) is frequently caused 
      by polymicrogyria (PMG). The aim of this study was to correlate the clinical and 
      psycholinguistic aspects with neuroradiological data of patients with CBPS.
      METHODS: Thirty-one patients were studied. We performed a clinical investigation 
      of the patients and their families, including MRI scanning, neuropsychological
      tests and language evaluation. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed that: a) 
      prenatal events are associated with the non-familial type of PMG; b) diffuse PMG 
      is associated with pseudobulbar signs, as opposed to BPPP; c) motor deficit is
      associated with diffuse PMG; d) epilepsy is equally present in patients with both
      familial or non-familial PMG, but is more frequently seen in patients with
      diffuse PMG; e) dyslexia and SLI can be a feature of both the diffuse or BPPP,
      and either familial or sporadic cases of PMG. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of
      clinical manifestations in CBPS is correlated with the extent of cortical
      involvement. Most patients with CBPS have a history of speech delay or language
      difficulties and no epilepsy. Dyslexia can be found in patients with PMG.

TI  - Impaired semantic processing during sentence reading in children with dyslexia:
      combined fMRI and ERP evidence.
PG  - 153-68
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.02.012 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a specific disorder of reading acquisition
      characterized by a phonological core deficit. Sentence reading is also impaired
      in dyslexic readers, but whether semantic processing deficits contribute is
      unclear. Combining spatially and temporally sensitive neuroimaging techniques to 
      focus on semantic processing can provide a more comprehensive characterization of
      sentence reading in dyslexia. We recorded brain activity from 52 children (16
      with dyslexia, 31 controls) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
      event-related potentials (ERP) in two separate counterbalanced sessions. The
      children silently read and occasionally judged simple sentences with semantically
      congruous or incongruous endings. fMRI and ERP activation during sentence reading
      and semantic processing was analyzed across all children and also by comparing
      children with dyslexia to controls. For sentence reading, we analyzed the
      response to all words in a sentence; for semantic processing, we contrasted
      responses to incongruous and congruous endings. Sentence reading was
      characterized by activation in a left-lateralized language network. Semantic
      processing was characterized by activation in left-hemispheric regions of the
      inferior frontal and superior temporal cortex and by an electrophysiological N400
      effect after 240 ms with consistent left anterior source localization. Children
      with dyslexia showed decreased activation for sentence reading in inferior
      parietal and frontal regions, and for semantic processing in inferior parietal
      regions, and during the N400 effect. Together, this suggests that semantic
      impairment during sentence reading reduces dyslexic children's response in left
      anterior brain regions underlying the more phasic N400 effect and subsequently
      modulates the more sustained BOLD response in left inferior parietal regions.

TI  - Poor readers but compelled to read: Stroop effects in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - We studied a group of 24 children with dyslexia in second to fifth primary school
      grades by using a discrete-trial computerized version of the Stroop Color-Word
      Test. Since the classic Stroop effect depends on the interference of reading with
      color naming, one would expect these children to show no interference or, at
      least, less interference than normal readers. Children with dyslexia showed,
      however, a Stroop effect larger than normal readers of the same age. This
      suggests that reading, although difficult and slow, is an inescapable step that
      precedes naming both in poor and in normal readers.

TI  - Sensitivity to visual and auditory stimuli in children with developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 116-41
AB  - This study considered the extent to which 23 children with dyslexia differed from
      23 reading age (RA) and 23 chronological age (CA) matched controls in their
      ability to make temporal judgements about auditory and visual sequences of
      stimuli, and in the speed of their reactions to the onsets and offsets of visual 
      and auditory stimuli. The children with dyslexia were slower (p = 0.039) than the
      CA controls in their reactions to non-verbal auditory onsets (tones), were less
      able to recognize the first stimulus of a sequence of tones (p = 0.022), and were
      less accurate in identifying the initial phoneme of a sequence of three (p <
      0.001). These characteristics may be manifestations of an impaired temporal
      processing system for rapid auditory stimuli. CA controls responded more quickly 
      to tone onsets than to tone offsets (p = 0.025), but the dyslexic and RA groups
      showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) in their reaction times to onsets and
      offsets of these non-verbal auditory stimuli. Dyslexic readers showed impairment 
      compared with CA controls in responding to the last of a sequence of three
      non-verbal visual stimuli (shapes), p = 0.02. Reaction times in the visual and
      auditory onset and offset tasks were richly intercorrelated in the control
      groups, but the dyslexic group did not show as many significant correlations in
      reaction times between the auditory and visual domains, or between the onset and 
      offset RTs within each modality. These results suggest that there may be a less
      integrated cross-modal and intra-modal temporal system in children with dyslexia 
      than in controls. In many of the measures in this study, the performance of the
      dyslexic group resembled that of the RA control group but differed from CA
      controls, which implies a developmental delay. The possibility that such a
      cognitive delay may be related to an underlying neurological disorder is
      discussed.

TI  - Visual deficits in developmental dyslexia: relationships between non-linguistic
      visual tasks and their contribution to components of reading.
PG  - 95-115
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is often characterized by a visual deficit, but the nature
      of this impairment and how it relates to reading ability is disputed (Brain 2003;
      126: 841-865). In order to investigate this issue, we compared groups of adults
      with and without dyslexia on the Ternus, visual-search and symbols tasks.
      Dyslexic readers yielded more errors on the visual-search and symbols tasks
      compared with non-dyslexic readers. A positive correlation between visual-search 
      and symbols task performance suggests a common mechanism shared by these tasks.
      Performance on the visual-search and symbols tasks also correlated with non-word 
      reading and rapid automatized naming measures, and visual search contributed
      independent variance to non-word reading. The Ternus task did not discriminate
      reading groups nor contributed significant variance to reading measures. We
      consider how visual-attention processes might underlie specific component reading
      measures.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: gray matter abnormalities in the occipitotemporal cortex.
PG  - 613-25
AB  - Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated less activation of
      the left occipitotemporal cortex in dyslexic readers. This region is considered
      critical for skilled reading and damage to it in adult readers leads to severe
      deficits in reading ability. In contrast to these findings, structural
      abnormalities in the occipitotemporal cortex were not consistently found to date.
      We used optimized Voxel Based Morphometry with T1 weighted MR images to
      investigate gray matter volume in 13 dyslexic and 15 nonimpaired reading
      adolescents (age 14-16). Less gray matter volume for dyslexic readers was found
      in the left and right fusiform gyrus, the bilateral anterior cerebellum and in
      the right supramarginal gyrus. Decreased gray matter volume in the left and right
      fusiform gyrus of dyslexic readers highlights the importance of this brain region
      for developmental dyslexia. The structural abnormalities in the right
      occipitotemporal cortex suggest that dyslexia may be such a persistent disorder
      because an occipitotemporal reading area, critical for skilled reading, cannot
      develop in any hemisphere. The extended areas of reduced gray matter volume in
      dyslexic readers in the cerebellum suggest that structural abnormalities in the
      cerebellum are also strongly associated with dyslexia and warrant further
      investigation.

      following IVF or ICSI-a systematic review.
PG  - 219-31
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dmn005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm 
      injection (ICSI) on the developing human brain is unclear. The objective of this 
      study is to evaluate neurodevelopmental (ND) outcome of children born following
      these techniques. METHODS: This systematic review includes studies which compare 
      a group of children born following IVF/ICSI to children born after natural
      conception by assessing outcome in terms of neuromotor development, cognition,
      speech/language and behaviour. Specific attention is paid to the studies'
      methodological quality based on study design, attrition, blinding of the
      assessor, validity of ND tests used, confounders included and group size or power
      analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 59 studies had a good methodological
      quality including 9 register-based (RB) and 14 controlled studies. RB studies
      suggested that IVF/ICSI per se does not increase the risk for severe cognitive
      impairment (i.e. mental retardation) or neuromotor handicaps such as cerebral
      palsy (CP), the association of IVF/ICSI and CP being brought about by the
      association of assisted conception with risk factors, like preterm birth. In
      general, controlled studies of good quality did not report an excess of ND
      disorders in IVF/ICSI-children. However, the majority of studies followed the
      children during infancy only, thereby precluding pertinent conclusions on the
      risk of ND disorders that come to the expression at older ages, such as fine
      manipulative disability or dyslexia. CONCLUSIONS: A negative effect of assisted
      conception on the developing human brain is not identified; however, further
      research of high methodological quality in children beyond pre-school age is
      needed.

PG  - 421-34
LID - 10.1080/13803390701520287 [doi]
AB  - The current study examined the psychometric properties of a hypothetical
      visuoperceptual-orthographic (VPO) reading construct in a sample of nonimpaired
      college students (N = 152). Participants were administered a battery of
      standardized and experimental measures of VPO, including Woodcock-Johnson III
      (WJ-III) Letter-Word Identification (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001),
      Visual-Naming Speed (word page of the Stroop), Letter-Identification Task,
      Same/Different Letter Decision Task, Word Matching Task, Homophone Decision Task,
      Pseudohomophone Decision Task, and Word Jumble Task. The LISREL 8.54 computer
      program (Joreskog & Sorbom, 2003) was employed for confirmatory factor analysis
      to assess the tenability of a multifaceted, unitary VPO reading construct.
      Goodness-of-fit statistics indicated that VPO is a hierarchically organized
      construct with one 2nd-order factor (i.e., VPO) and three 1st-order factors
      (i.e., perceptual processing speed, prelexical accuracy, and lexicosemantic
      accuracy). Alternative models were tested but produced unsatisfactory
      goodness-of-fit statistics. Altogether these findings are in agreement with those
      of previous cognitive and neuroscientific studies and further support the notion 
      that VPO should be viewed as a unique factor in the assessment, diagnosis, and
      remediation of developmental dyslexia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculomotor control has been implicated as a factor when reading is
      poor, but few studies exist for adolescents. METHODS: The saccadic eye movement
      efficiency of 684 ninth grade students, identified as poor readers in 5
      California high schools, was quantified using the Developmental Eye Movement
      test. Frequency distributions were produced from scores on vertical and
      horizontal components, and gender and test-retest factors were considered during 
      analysis. RESULTS: Vertical times were within 1 standard deviation of normal for 
      eighth grade. However, horizontal (saccadic) times were typical of grade 3, and
      the average number of errors on the horizontal test was typical of grade 2. Boys 
      and girls performed similarly. Results of retests showed slightly improved
      horizontal times and fewer errors, but the grade level equivalents remained
      dramatically low. Overall, fewer than 10% of students scored above the 50th
      percentile for eighth grade. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that poor readers
      in high school may be at high risk for poor saccadic tracking skill.

AB  - The report of cases of pure alexia suggests that some regions of the neural
      system are dedicated to reading-specific visual processing abilities. Pure alexia
      results from the disruption or the disconnection of the visual word form area, a 
      region reproducibly located within the left occipito-temporal sulcus and encoding
      the abstract identity of strings of visual letters. The functional specialization
      of this area suggests that it is initially plastic and becomes attuned to the
      orthographic regularities that constrain letter combination during the
      acquisition of literacy. The visual word form area further belongs to the network
      of areas that are consistently implicated in studies of people with developmental
      dyslexia. Developmental dyslexia is typically interpreted as resulting from a
      core phonological disorder and most neuroimaging studies showed reduced activity 
      in the left perisylvian regions which have a role in phonological processes.
      Although low level visual and/or visual attentional disorders have been
      consistently reported suggesting a visual basis of developmental dyslexia, these 
      disorders typically co-occurred with phonological problems so that the
      phonological deficit was viewed as the most plausible cause of the poor reading
      outcome of dyslexic children. In the last years however, dissociations have been 
      reported in developmental dyslexia between phonological processing deficits and a
      particular kind of visual disorder, a visual attention span deficit characterised
      by a reduction in the number of distinct orthographic units which can be
      processed simultaneously in a single fixation. Large sample studies revealed that
      a non trivial number of dyslexic children exhibit a visual attention span
      disorder and that this disorder typically dissociates from phonological
      impairments in the dyslexic population. Neuroimaging studies suggest involvement 
      of the parietal lobes - in particular the superior parietal lobules - in visual
      attention span and these brain regions are less active in people with
      developmental dyslexia. A visual attention span disorder thus appears as a second
      core disorder related to a parietal dysfunction in developmental dyslexia.
      Further studies are required to determine whether the phonological disorder or
      the visual attention span disorder independently contribute to the development of
      the visual word form area during literacy acquisition. These neurobiological
      dysfunctions are further modulated by environmental factors such as language
      characteristics, remedial interventions or socio-economic status. Future studies 
      would help better understanding the interactions between neurobiological and
      environmental factors and the potential influence of the later on the development
      of the visual word form area.

TI  - A structural-functional basis for dyslexia in the cortex of Chinese readers.
PG  - 5561-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0801750105 [doi]
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a neurobiologically based disorder that affects
      approximately 5-17% of school children and is characterized by a severe
      impairment in reading skill acquisition. For readers of alphabetic (e.g.,
      English) languages, recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that dyslexia
      is associated with weak reading-related activity in left temporoparietal and
      occipitotemporal regions, and this activity difference may reflect reductions in 
      gray matter volume in these areas. Here, we find different structural and
      functional abnormalities in dyslexic readers of Chinese, a nonalphabetic
      language. Compared with normally developing controls, children with impaired
      reading in logographic Chinese exhibited reduced gray matter volume in a left
      middle frontal gyrus region previously shown to be important for Chinese reading 
      and writing. Using functional MRI to study language-related activation of
      cortical regions in dyslexics, we found reduced activation in this same left
      middle frontal gyrus region in Chinese dyslexics versus controls, and there was a
      significant correlation between gray matter volume and activation in the language
      task in this same area. By contrast, Chinese dyslexics did not show functional or
      structural (i.e., volumetric gray matter) differences from normal subjects in the
      more posterior brain systems that have been shown to be abnormal in
      alphabetic-language dyslexics. The results suggest that the structural and
      functional basis for dyslexia varies between alphabetic and nonalphabetic
      languages.

TI  - Confirmation of dyslexia susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1p and 2p, but not 6p
      in a Dutch sib-pair collection.
PG  - 294-300
AB  - In this study, we attempted to confirm genetic linkage to developmental dyslexia 
      and reading-related quantitative traits of loci that have been shown to be
      associated with dyslexia in previous studies. In our sample of 108 Dutch nuclear 
      families, the categorical trait showed strongest linkage to 1p36 (NPL-LOD = 2.1).
      LOD scores for quantitative traits word-reading, non-word reading, and rapid
      naming peaked near the same location as the categorical trait, as well as on
      chromosome 2. Non-word repetition showed little phenotypic correlation with
      dyslexia or with the other quantitative traits, and this trait showed linkage
      peaks on 11p and 15q. No evidence for linkage to 6p22-23 was found for this set
      of families. Comparison of our results and literature data shows that loci link
      to different phenotypes in different samples. The mutual connections of these
      traits and their relation to developmental dyslexia remain elusive.

TI  - Characterization of language and reading skills in familial polymicrogyria.
PG  - 254-60
AB  - Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a malformation of cortical development characterized by
      an excessive number of small gyri and abnormal cortical lamination, giving the
      cortical surface an irregular and gross appearance. The severity of clinical
      manifestations correlates with the extent of cortical involvement. The objective 
      of the present study was to describe three families with linguistic features of
      developmental language disorder and reading impairment, and to establish a
      neuroanatomic correlation through neuroimaging. Subjects have been submitted to a
      comprehensive protocol including psychological assessment, language evaluation,
      neurological examination, and neuroimaging investigation. In our families,
      children usually had the diagnosis of developmental language disorder while
      adults had the diagnosis of reading impairment. MRI showed perisylvian
      polymicrogyria in several subjects of each family. Our data support the idea that
      there is a co-occurrence of developmental language disorder and reading
      impairment and both conditions may be associated with polymicrogyria.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia and the dual route model of reading: simulating individual
      differences and subtypes.
PG  - 151-78
AB  - Developmental dyslexia was investigated within a well-understood and fully
      specified computational model of reading aloud: the dual route cascaded model
      (DRC [Coltheart, M., Rastle, K., Perry, C., Langdon, R., & Ziegler, J.C. (2001). 
      DRC: A dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud.
      Psychological Review, 108, 204-256.]). Four tasks were designed to assess each
      representational level of the DRC: letter level, orthographic lexicon,
      phonological lexicon, and phoneme system. The data showed no single cause of
      dyslexia, but rather a complex pattern of phonological, phonemic, and letter
      processing deficits. Importantly, most dyslexics had deficits in more than one
      domain. Subtyping analyses also suggested that both the phonological and surface 
      dyslexics almost always had more than a single underlying deficit. To simulate
      the reading performance for each individual with the DRC, we added noise to the
      model at a level proportional to the underlying deficit(s) of each individual.
      The simulations not only accounted fairly well for individual reading patterns
      but also captured the different dyslexia profiles discussed in the literature
      (i.e., surface, phonological, mixed, and mild dyslexia). Thus, taking into
      account the multiplicity of underlying deficits on an individual basis provides a
      parsimonious and accurate description of developmental dyslexia. The present work
      highlights the necessity and merits of investigating dyslexia at the level of
      each individual rather than as a unitary disorder.

TI  - Isolating global and specific factors in developmental dyslexia: a study based on
      the rate and amount model (RAM).
PG  - 551-60
LID - 10.1007/s00221-007-1257-9 [doi]
AB  - Using the reading-age match approach, research on developmental dyslexia focuses 
      on specific (e.g., phonological) deficits and disregards the possible role of
      global influences in determining the disturbance. In the present study, we set
      out to investigate the role of both global and specific factors in Italian
      developmental dyslexics using the rate-amount model (RAM; Faust et al. in Psychol
      Bull 125:777-799, 1999). Vocal reaction times (RT) in naming pictures, words and 
      non-words of varying length were measured in a group of 26 sixth- to eighth-grade
      dyslexics and 81 age-matched control readers. Dyslexics' raw RTs showed greater
      lexicality (longer RTs to non-words than words) and length (longer RTs to long
      stimuli than short ones) effects than controls'. We found that one global factor 
      predicted most individual variation in naming words and non-words, but not
      pictures. When data transformations, effective in controlling for the global
      factor, were applied to the data, the greater lexicality effect in dyslexics
      vanished, due to the influence of the global factor and not a specific failure in
      the non-lexical reading procedure. Conversely, the greater length effect in
      dyslexics persisted. Overall, dyslexics' reading performance was best explained
      as due to the influence of both a global factor for processing orthographic
      material prelexically and to the specific influence of stimulus length. This
      conceptualisation appears more promising for bridging the gap between behavioural
      and functional imaging studies than traditional approaches, which focus on the
      detection of specific reading deficits. It is concluded that RAM is a useful tool
      for disentangling the components that are impaired in reading and for defining
      the characteristics of the global factor, because the paradigm is more powerful
      for studying developmental dyslexia than the reading-age match method.

TI  - Differences in effective connectivity between dyslexic children and normal
      readers during a pseudoword reading task: an fMRI study.
PG  - 73-82
LID - 10.1016/j.neucli.2007.12.007 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This fMRI study investigated phonological and lexicosemantic processing 
      in dyslexic and in chronological age- and reading level-matched children in a
      pseudoword reading task. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective connectivity
      network was compared between the three groups using a structural model including 
      the supramarginal cortex (BA 40; BA: Brodmann area), fusiform cortex (BA 37) and 
      inferior frontal cortex (BA 44/45) areas of the left hemisphere. RESULTS: The
      results revealed differences in connectivity patterns. In dyslexic patients, in
      contrast with chronological age- and reading level-matched groups, no causal
      relationship was demonstrated between BA 40 and BA 44/45. However, a significant 
      causal relationship was demonstrated between BA 37 and BA 44/45 both in dyslexic 
      children and in the reading level-matched group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings were
      interpreted as evidence for a phonological deficit in developmental dyslexia.

AB  - Embryonic knockdown of candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene (CDSG) homologs in 
      cerebral cortical progenitor cells in the rat results in acute disturbances of
      neocortical migration. In the current report we investigated the effects of
      embryonic knockdown and overexpression of the homolog of DCDC2, one of the CDSGs,
      on the postnatal organization of the cerebral cortex. Using a within-litter
      design, we transfected cells in rat embryo neocortical ventricular zone around
      embryonic day (E) 15 with either 1) small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting
      Dcdc2, 2) a DCDC2 overexpression construct, 3) Dcdc2 shRNA along with DCDC2
      overexpression construct, 4) an overexpression construct composed of the C
      terminal domain of DCDC2, or 5) an overexpression construct composed of the DCX
      terminal domain of DCDC2. RNAi of Dcdc2 resulted in pockets of heterotopic
      neurons in the periventricular region. Approximately 25% of the transfected
      brains had hippocampal pyramidal cell migration anomalies. Dcdc2
      shRNA-transfected neurons migrated in a bimodal pattern, with approximately 7% of
      the neurons migrating a short distance from the ventricular zone, and another 30%
      migrating past their expected lamina. Rats transfected with Dcdc2 shRNA along
      with the DCDC2 overexpression construct rescued the periventricular heterotopia
      phenotype, but did not affect the percentage of transfected neurons that migrate 
      past their expected laminar location. There were no malformations associated with
      any of the overexpression constructs, nor was there a significant laminar
      disruption of migration. These results support the claim that knockdown of Dcdc2 
      expression results in neuronal migration disorders similar to those seen in the
      brains of dyslexics.

TI  - The dyslexia-associated gene KIAA0319 encodes highly N- and O-glycosylated plasma
      membrane and secreted isoforms.
PG  - 859-71
AB  - The KIAA0319 gene has been recently associated with developmental dyslexia and
      shown to be involved in neuronal migration. The deduced KIAA0319 protein contains
      several polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domains which may mediate the interaction
      between neurons and glial fibres during neuronal migration. We have previously
      reported the presence of several alternative splicing variants, some of which are
      predicted to affect the deduced protein. In this study, we over-expressed
      constructs containing the main form (A) and two alternative variants (B and C) of
      KIAA0319. We show that the full-length KIAA0319 (A) is a type I plasma membrane
      protein, a topology consistent with its proposed function in neuronal migration. 
      The oligomeric status of KIAA0319 is mainly dimeric, and this condition depends
      on the cysteine-rich regions of the protein, especially the transmembrane (TM)
      domain and surrounding sequence. KIAA0319 is highly glycosylated in different
      mammalian cell lines. The central region including the PKD domains is
      N-glycosylated. Furthermore, a short fragment N-terminal to the PKD domains
      contains mucin-type O-glycosylation. The two alternative isoforms are soluble
      proteins lacking the TM domain and, interestingly, only isoform B is secreted.
      KIAA0319-deletion proteins lacking the TM domain were also secreted. These
      results suggest that KIAA0319 could be involved not only in cell-cell
      interactions, but also in signalling.

TI  - Reading ability and phonological awareness in Japanese children with dyslexia.
PG  - 179-88
AB  - In alphabetic languages, the deficit of the phonological awareness is considered 
      as the core deficit in developmental dyslexia. However, the role of phonological 
      awareness in the acquisition of reading Japanese kana, the transparent,
      mora-based phonogram, has not been understood completely. We examine the
      abilities of Japanese dyslexic children on different types of Japanese
      phonological tasks, and discussed which tasks significantly account for each
      aspect of reading ability. METHODS: Fifteen dyslexic children (9.53+/-1.52 years 
      old), and 15 children with normal reading ability (9.17+/-0.90 years old)
      participated in this study. They performed three types of phonological awareness 
      tasks. The mora counting task and the mora reversal task of words require
      phonological awareness at the mora level. The letter rhyming task, which
      resembles the task in English language, requires phonological awareness at the
      phoneme level. We evaluated the reading ability by the reading speed, the reading
      errors, and the number of pauses while reading sentences aloud. RESULTS: The task
      performances of the dyslexic group on all three phonological awareness tasks were
      significantly lower than those of the control group. Stepwise multiple regression
      analysis revealed that the mora counting task and the rhyming letter task most
      significantly explained the reading speed and number of reading pauses. The mora 
      reversal task of words, together with the antegraded digit span, significantly
      explained the reading errors. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese dyslexics showed deficits of 
      phonological awareness both at the mora and the phoneme levels. Phonological
      awareness must be crucial for acquiring the ability of decoding phonograms,
      including Japanese kana.

TI  - Identical neural risk factors predict cognitive deficit in dyslexia and
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 147-58
LID - 10.1037/0894-4105.22.2.147 [doi]
AB  - In previous work, the authors found that an anatomical risk index created from
      the combination of 7 neuroanatomical measures predicted reading and oral language
      skills in individuals with learning disabilities. Individuals with small auditory
      brain structures and reduced asymmetry had more deficits than those with large
      structures and exaggerated asymmetry. In the present study, the same anatomical
      index predicted reading and other cognitive abilities in 45 individuals with
      chronic schizophrenia. The anatomical risk index was significantly associated
      with broad cognitive ability (Pearson r = .53, p < .0001), reading comprehension 
      (r = .58, p < .0001), and a measure of nonverbal reasoning (r = .39, p < .01),
      but not with age, parental socioeconomic status, symptom measures, alcohol use,
      or processing speed. These findings support the prediction that reduced size and 
      asymmetry in temporal lobe auditory cortex and cerebellum may not be specific
      risk factors for schizophrenia but for cognitive deficits that characterize a
      broad spectrum of developmental disorders.

TI  - Sequential or simultaneous visual processing deficit in developmental dyslexia?
PG  - 979-88
LID - 10.1016/j.visres.2008.01.025 [doi]
AB  - The ability of dyslexic children with or without phonological problems to process
      simultaneous and sequential visual information was assessed using two tasks
      requiring the oral report of simultaneously or sequentially displayed
      letter-strings. The two groups were found to exhibit a simultaneous visual
      processing deficit but preserved serial processing skills. However, the
      impairment in simultaneous processing was larger in the dyslexic group with no
      phonological disorder. Although sequential and simultaneous processing skills
      both related to reading performance, simultaneous processing alone significantly 
      contributed to reading speed and accuracy. These findings suggest that a
      simultaneous processing disorder might contribute to developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Dysfunctional hemispheric asymmetry of theta and beta EEG activity during
      linguistic tasks in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 123-31
AB  - The phonological deficit hypothesis of dyslexia was studied by analyzing
      language-related lateralization of theta (4-8 Hz) and beta rhythms (13-30 Hz)
      during various phases of word processing in a sample of 14 dyslexics and 28
      controls. Using a word-pair paradigm, the same words were contrasted in three
      different tasks: Phonological, Semantic and Orthographic. Compared with controls,
      dyslexic children showed a delay in behavioral responses which was paralleled by 
      sustained theta EEG peak activity. In addition, controls showed greater theta and
      beta activation at left frontal sites specifically during the Phonological task, 
      whereas dyslexics showed a dysfunctional pattern, as they were right-lateralized 
      at these sites in all tasks. At posterior locations, and reversed with respect to
      controls' EEG responses, dyslexics showed greater left lateralization during both
      Phonological and Orthographic tasks--a result which, in these children, indicates
      an altered and difficult phonological transcoding process during verbal working
      memory phases of word processing. Results point to a deficit, in phonological
      dyslexia, in recruitment of left hemisphere structures for encoding and
      integrating the phonological components of words, and suggest that the
      fundamental hierarchy within the linguistic network is disrupted.

TI  - Remediation of developmental dyslexia: tackling a basic memory deficit.
PG  - 38-55
LID - 10.1080/02643290701836138 [doi]
AB  - Remediation studies of developmental dyslexia are extremely rare. We present a
      single case study of an 8-year-old German developmental dyslexic boy K.H. who is 
      hypothesized to suffer from a severe memory problem, impeding the development of 
      normal reading functions. The memory problem especially affects the storage and
      access to letter-sound associations. As a consequence, the boy was initially
      unable to accurately and quickly name most of the 26 letters of the alphabet. A
      multiple-baseline across-material design with a high-frequency errorless learning
      procedure was set up to improve letter-name associations. The intervention
      improved K.H.'s letter reading and even his word reading. We discuss the role of 
      memory deficits in reading acquisition in the context of three different
      theoretical models. We show how such theoretical considerations can successfully 
      guide remediation programmes.

TI  - Dichotic listening deficits in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 54-75
AB  - Several auditory processing deficits have been reported in children with
      dyslexia. In order to assess for the presence of a binaural integration type of
      auditory processing deficit, dichotic listening tests with digits, words and
      consonant-vowel (CV) pairs were administered to two groups of right-handed
      11-year-old children, one group diagnosed with developmental dyslexia and an
      age-matched control group. Dyslexic children performed more poorly than controls 
      from their left ears when listening to digits and words and from their right ears
      when listening to CVs. Direction of ear advantage varied across individuals in
      both groups when tested with digits and CVs, but ear advantage was stable with
      words. Several factors that may have contributed to inconsistencies in direction 
      of ear advantage are discussed. When the children were tested in a directed
      response mode, degree of ear advantage differed significantly between groups with
      both words and digits. More dyslexic than control children demonstrated
      clinically significant reductions in dichotic listening performance, but no
      uniform pattern of deficit emerged. Only the double correct score and the left
      ear score with CV pairs were predictive of word recognition performance in
      dyslexic children. Binaural integration deficits are present in some children
      with dyslexia. Auditory processing disorder assessment may help delineate factors
      that underlie or are associated with reading impairment in this population.

TI  - Unimpaired implicit learning in children with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - Children with dyslexia have consistently been found to have a variety of deficits
      in motor, cognitive, and sensory processes; however, the few studies that have
      been reported of the implicit learning ability of these children have produced
      conflicting results. The present study aimed to investigate the implicit learning
      abilities of children with developmental dyslexia using a simple cued reaction
      time task which has not been studied with this group previously. Twenty-three
      children with developmental dyslexia and 37 normally developing children, between
      the ages of 8 and 10 years, participated in the task. The results were consistent
      with the hypothesis in demonstrating that, despite an overall slowing in response
      times, dyslexic children show the same degree of implicit learning as normal
      readers, thus, providing evidence for an unimpaired implicit learning mechanism
      in dyslexic individuals. These results hold implications for the underlying
      mechanisms of learning, as dyslexic individuals who are impaired on explicit
      learning tasks, such as reading, spelling and writing, are unimpaired on implicit
      learning tasks. They suggest the existence of two separate systems of learning,
      each possessing distinct mechanisms.

TI  - Co-occurring disorders: a possible key to visual perceptual deficits in children 
      with developmental coordination disorder?
PG  - 154-69
LID - 10.1016/j.humov.2007.09.002 [doi]
AB  - A study was conducted to examine how visual perceptual functioning in children
      with DCD may be influenced by co-occurring learning problems such as reading
      disabilities (RD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
      Participants included seven groups of children: 27 children with DCD only, 11
      with ADHD only, 14 with RD only, 63 with DCD and at least one other disorder
      (i.e., DCD + ADHD, DCD + RD, DCD + ADHD + RD), and 73 typically developing
      controls. Visual perceptual skills were assessed using the Test of Visual
      Perceptual Skills (TVPS) and the Rey Osterreith Complex Figure (ROCF; copy and
      delayed recall). Children with DCD and at least one other disorder were found to 
      have impairments on the TVPS compared to children with DCD only, ADHD only, and
      typically developing controls, particularly on subtests assessing visual memory. 
      On the ROCF, children with DCD and at least one other disorder scored
      significantly lower than children with ADHD only or RD only. Children with DCD
      plus one other disorder were then subdivided into three groups: DCD + ADHD, DCD +
      RD, and DCD + ADHD + RD and compared to children with DCD only, ADHD only, and RD
      only. Results indicated that children with DCD + ADHD + RD had significant
      impairments on the TVPS compared to children with DCD only and children with ADHD
      only. On the ROCF, children with DCD + ADHD + RD scored significantly lower than 
      all of the groups, except the DCD+RD group. These findings suggest that DCD on
      its own is not associated with visual perceptual problems; rather, it is the
      presence of co-occurring disorders that is a possible key to visual perceptual
      deficits in children with DCD. The number of co-occurring disorders present with 
      DCD is associated with the severity of the visual perceptual dysfunction.
      Deficits in visual memory skills appear to be a specific area of difficulty for
      children with DCD and co-occurring RD and/or ADHD.

TI  - Handedness in patients with developmental coordination disorder.
PG  - 151-4
AB  - Developmental coordination disorder affects 5% to 8% of the general population,
      and about 50% to 60% of these children have a comorbid attention-deficit disorder
      with hyperactivity and learning disorders. Left-handedness is relatively common
      among children with dyslexia, learning disabilities, and autism; however, its
      frequency in children with developmental coordination disorder is less clear. The
      present study investigated the distribution of hand dominance in 98 children (age
      range, 5.5-17 years) with developmental coordination disorder compared with their
      parents or siblings. Thirty children (30.6%) were left-handed and 13 (13.3%) were
      ambidextrous. The prevalence of left-handedness among their parents and siblings 
      was similar to that of the general population. The results suggest that children 
      with developmental coordination disorder, like children with learning disorders
      and deficit disorder with hyperactivity, present with higher frequency of
      left-hand dominance compared with the general population.

TI  - Writing problems in developmental dyslexia: under-recognized and under-treated.
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jsp.2006.11.008 [doi]
AB  - The International Dyslexia Association defines dyslexia as unexpected problems of
      neurobiological origin in accuracy and rate of oral reading of single real words,
      single pseudowords, or text or of written spelling. However, prior research has
      focused more on the reading than the spelling problems of students with dyslexia.
      A test battery was administered to 122 children who met inclusion criteria for
      dyslexia and qualified their families for participation in a family genetics
      study that has been ongoing for over a decade. Their parents completed the same
      test battery. Although a past structural equation modeling study of typically
      developing children identified a significant path from handwriting to composition
      quality, the current structural equation modeling study identified a significant 
      path from spelling to composition for children and their parents with dyslexia.
      Grapho-motor planning did not contribute uniquely to their composition, showing
      that writing is not just a motor skill. Students with dyslexia do have a problem 
      in automatic letter writing and naming, which was related to impaired inhibition 
      and verbal fluency, and may explain their spelling problems. Results are
      discussed in reference to the importance of providing explicit instruction in the
      phonological, orthographic, and morphological processes of spelling and in
      composition to students with dyslexia and not only offering accommodation for
      their writing problems.

TI  - The education of dyslexic children from childhood to young adulthood.
PG  - 451-75
AB  - The past two decades have witnessed an explosion in our understanding of dyslexia
      (or specific reading disability), the most common and most carefully studied of
      the learning disabilities. We first review the core concepts of dyslexia: its
      definition, prevalence, and developmental course. Next we examine the cognitive
      model of dyslexia, especially the phonological theory, and review empiric data
      suggesting genetic and neurobiological influences on the development of dyslexia.
      With the scientific underpinnings of dyslexia serving as a foundation, we turn
      our attention to evidence-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment, including 
      interventions and accommodations. Teaching reading represents a major focus. We
      first review those reading interventions effective in early grades, and then
      review interventions for older students. To date the preponderance of
      intervention studies have focused on word-level reading; newer studies are
      beginning to examine reading interventions that have gone beyond word reading to 
      affect reading fluency and reading comprehension. The article concludes with a
      discussion of the critical role of accommodations for dyslexic students and the
      recent neurobiological evidence supporting the need for such accommodations.

PG  - 87-92
AB  - Very few studies have investigated the development of visual search of aligned
      stimuli in relation to normal reading acquisition and in developmental dyslexia. 
      In this study we used a new computerised experimental task which requires a
      visuo-motor response (RT) to a target appearing unpredictably in one out of seven
      different spatial positions on a horizontally aligned array of 18 geometrical
      figures. The aims of the study were to investigate: 1) the visual scanning
      development in normal children from pre-school to school age; 2) whether visual
      scanning performance in kindergarten children could predict reading acquisition; 
      3) the visual scanning abilities in a group of developmental dyslexic children.
      The main results were: 1) a significant decrement of RTs with age and a
      progressive increase of the left-to-right gradient with reading experience; 2)
      visual scanning abilities in kindergarten proved to be a good predictor of
      reading acquisition; 3) dyslexics were slow scanners and did not present the
      left-to-right strategy typical of normal readers. The results support the
      hypothesis of a relationship between visual scanning and reading abilities.

TI  - False recollection in children with reading comprehension difficulties.
PG  - 222-33
AB  - Children with reading comprehension difficulties display impaired performance on 
      semantic processing tasks. These impairments are assumed to reflect weaker
      knowledge about abstract semantic associations between words in poor
      comprehenders [Nation, K., and Snowling, M. (1999). Developmental differences in 
      sensitivity to semantic relations among good and poor comprehenders: evidence
      from semantic priming. Cognition, 19, B1-B13.]. We examined the performance of
      poor comprehenders on the Deese/Roediger/McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Children
      studied spoken words that were semantic associates (e.g., bed, rest, and awake)
      or phonological associates (e.g., pole, bowl, and hole) followed by free recall
      and a recognition test containing nonstudied critical words (e.g., sleep and
      roll). Results showed reduced recall and recognition of critical words in the
      semantic condition but not in the phonological condition for poor comprehenders. 
      We argue that poor comprehenders are less sensitive to abstract semantic

AB  - It has been suggested that reading disability (RD), autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD), and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) share a measure of
      genetic overlap. They also share some epidemiological features, and have all been
      suspected of multifactorial (genetic and environmental) threshold origins. It has
      also been hypothesized that ASD, pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise
      specified, and ADHD are partially caused by high maternal intrauterine
      testosterone levels. Here I offer a new method of testing this latter hypothesis 
      on some of these disorders (RD, ADHD, and ASD). All these disorders occur more
      commonly in males. If the intrauterine testosterone hypothesis was correct, then 
      probands should have a statistically significant excess of brothers among their
      siblings. Data are adduced here to test this. When treated as individual
      disorders, the data are significant only in the case of RD. However, the data are
      highly significant when pooled as RD + ADHD or RD + ADHD + ASD. Taken alone, the 
      data on ASD are not significant. These results suggest that: (1) taxonomically,
      RD and ADHD are moresimilar to one another than either is to ASD; and (2)
      probands in the pooled samples have a very highly significant excess of brothers.
      This result stands in need of explanation. Provisionally, the data may be
      interpreted as suggesting that RD may be caused by high intrauterine testosterone
      levels, and confirming the hypothesis that ADHD is partially caused by high
      intrauterine testosterone.

AB  - A unifying theoretical framework of three working memory components provides a
      systems perspective for discussing past and new findings in a 12-year research
      program that point to heterogeneity in the genetic and brain basis and behavioral
      expression of dyslexia: (a) codes for word-form storage and processing, (b)
      time-sensitive phonological and orthographic loops for maintaining information in
      working memory or outputting it, and (c) executive functions for language (e.g., 
      rapid automatic switching of attention). Results, which span the genetic to
      neurological to behavioral levels of analysis, point to possible impairment in
      any one or combination of these working memory components in individuals with
      dyslexia. A DNA variation on chromosome 15 may be linked with the phonological
      word-form in the first working-memory component. A DNA variation on chromosome 6 
      may be linked with slow rapid automatic switching, inattention ratings, and
      impaired goal-directed activity ratings in the third working-memory component.
      Brain and behavioral findings support (a) Triple Word Form Theory: phonological, 
      orthographic, and morphological word-forms and their parts contribute to learning
      to read and spell words; and (b) Cross-Word Form Mapping: in the process of
      learning to read and spell words children compute the inter-relationships among
      the three word-forms and their parts. However, children with dyslexia may require
      more focus on the morphological word-form and its parts and their relationships
      with the other two word-forms and their parts than do normal readers. Also,
      children with dyslexia have unusual difficulties in sustaining phonological loop 
      function in working memory over time; their impaired orthographic loop function
      may interfere with learning to write alphabet letters and spell, which may be as 
      impaired as word decoding and reading. Impaired executive functions may interfere
      with the efficiency of working memory in processing oral and written language.

AB  - Developmental language disorders are characterized by a maturational trajectory
      that deviates or lags that of normal children. Given the wide variation in the
      rate of normal language development, diagnosis and classification of these
      disorders poses severe problems for the clinician. Our laboratory has been
      searching for anatomical signatures that could aid the development of a
      neurobiologically based classification. Quantitative analysis of the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of a series of samples of children and adults
      with reading and language disorders has identified two clusters with contrasting 
      anatomical and reading profiles. Individuals with small symmetrical brain
      structures tend to have deficits in multiple domains of written and oral language
      whereas those with larger asymmetrical structures are more likely to have the
      isolated phonological deficits seen in adults with compensated dyslexia.
      Surprisingly, the anatomical risk factors that define these clusters do not form 
      a continuum of increasing severity but deviate in opposite directions from
      normal. Individuals with moderate brain size and asymmetry typically demonstrate 
      the best overall performance. Further research should determine if phonological
      impairments in the two clusters are associated with differing genetic and
      environmental risk factors requiring different types of intervention.

TI  - Sentence production in students with dyslexia.
PG  - 55-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: While spoken language deficits have been identified in children with 
      developmental dyslexia, microanalysis of sentence production proficiency in these
      children is a largely unexplored area. AIMS: The current study examines
      proficiency of syntactic production in children and young adults with dyslexia
      and typically developing age-matched controls on a constrained sentence
      production task targeting two advanced argument structures, theme-experiencer
      verbs and irregular past participles. METHODS & PROCEDURES: Participants aged
      between 8 and 22 years produced sentences that included three stimulus words, a
      proper name, an inanimate noun and a verb from one of three categories: control
      verbs (agent-patient verbs with regular morphology); theme-experiencer verbs,
      which require an inanimate subject in active sentences (e.g. The book bored
      Sarah); and irregular past participles, which require awareness of the syntactic 
      requirements associated with the -en past participle ending, i.e. that this verb 
      form cannot be used as a simple past tense (e.g. *Mary ___ hidden the candy).
      OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Students with dyslexia produced more dysfluent, ungrammatical
      and incomplete responses than normal readers; however, the developmental
      trajectories of the verb types varied between groups. Normal readers performed
      similarly with both experimental verb types, but those with dyslexia were
      particularly impaired using irregular past participles in sentences. CONCLUSIONS:
      The findings support a model of lexical representation in which development of
      grammar hinges on the acquisition of lexical knowledge. Furthermore, the data
      suggest that individuals with dyslexia may have difficulties with sentence
      formulation that persist into adulthood.

TI  - The KIAA0319-like (KIAA0319L) gene on chromosome 1p34 as a candidate for reading 
      disabilities.
PG  - 295-313
LID - 10.1080/01677060802354328 [doi]
AB  - A locus on chromosome 1p34-36 (DYX8) has been linked to developmental dyslexia or
      reading disabilities (RD) in three independent samples. In the current study, we 
      investigated a candidate gene KIAA0319-Like (KIAA0319L) within DYX8, as it is
      homologous to KIAA0319, a strong RD candidate gene on chromosome 6p (DYX2).
      Association was assessed by using five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in
      a sample of 291 nuclear families ascertained through a proband with reading
      difficulties. Evidence of association was found for a single marker (rs7523017;
      P=0.042) and a haplotype (P=0.031), with RD defined as a categorical trait in a
      subset of the sample (n=156 families) with a proband that made our criteria for
      RD. The same haplotype also showed evidence for association with quantitative
      measures of word-reading efficiency (i.e., a composite score of word
      identification and decoding; P=0.032) and rapid naming of objects and colors
      (P=0.047) when analyzed using the entire sample. Although the results from the
      current study are modestly significant and would not withstand a correction for
      multiple testing, KIAA0319L remains an intriguing positional and functional
      candidate for RD, especially when considered alongside the supporting evidence
      for its homolog KIAA0319 on chromosome 6p. Additional studies in independent
      samples are now required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Potential links between the language and motor systems in the brain have long
      attracted the interest of developmental psychologists. In this paper, we
      investigate a link often observed (e.g., [Wolff, P.H., 2002. Timing precision and
      rhythm in developmental dyslexia. Reading and Writing, 15 (1), 179-206.] between 
      motor tapping and written language skills. We measure rhythmic finger tapping
      (paced by a metronome beat versus unpaced) and motor dexterity, phonological and 
      auditory processing in 10-year old children, some of whom had a diagnosis of
      developmental dyslexia. We report links between paced motor tapping, auditory
      rhythmic processing and written language development. Motor dexterity does not
      explain these relationships. In regression analyses, paced finger tapping
      explained unique variance in reading and spelling. An interpretation based on the
      importance of rhythmic timing for both motor skills and language development is
      proposed.

TI  - Optimized voxel-based morphometry in children with developmental dyscalculia.
PG  - 417-22
AB  - Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a specific learning disability affecting the
      normal acquisition of arithmetic skills. Current studies estimate that 3-6% of
      the school population is affected by DD. Genetic, neurobiological, and
      epidemiologic evidence indicates that dyscalculia is a brain-based disorder.
      Imaging studies suggest the involvement of parietal and prefrontal cortices in
      arithmetic tasks. The aim of the present study was to analyze if children with DD
      show structural differences in parietal, frontal, and cingulate areas compared to
      typically achieving children. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained from 12
      children with DD aged 9.3+/-0.2 years and 12 age-matched control children without
      any learning disabilities on a 1.5 T whole-body scanner. Voxel-based morphometry 
      analysis with an optimization of spatial segmentation and normalization
      procedures was applied to compare the two groups in order to find differences in 
      cerebral gray and white matter. Compared to controls, children with DD show
      significantly reduced gray matter volume in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS),
      the anterior cingulum, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the bilateral middle 
      frontal gyri. White matter comparison demonstrates clusters with significantly
      less volume in the left frontal lobe and in the right parahippocampal gyrus in
      dyscalculic children. The decreased gray and white matter volumes in the
      frontoparietal network might be the neurological substrate of impaired arithmetic
      processing skills. The white matter volume decrease in parahippocampal areas may 
      have influence on fact retrieval and spatial memory processing.

PG  - 2292-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.03.024 [doi]
AB  - The recent neuroimaging literature gives conflicting evidence about whether the
      left fusiform gyrus (FG) might recognize words as unitary visual objects. The
      sensitivity of the left FG to word frequency might provide a neural basis for the
      orthographic input lexicon theorized by reading models [Patterson, K., Marshall, 
      J. C., & Coltheart, M. (1985). Surface dyslexia: Cognitive and neuropsychological
      studies of phonological reading. London: Lawrence Erlbaum]. The goal of this
      study was to investigate the time course and neural correlates of word processing
      in right-handed readers engaged in an orthographic decision task. Three hundred
      and twenty Italian words of high and low written frequency and 320 non-derived
      legal pseudo-words were presented for 250ms in the central visual field. ERPs
      were recorded from 128 scalp sites in 10 Italian University students. Behavioural
      data showed a word superiority effect, with faster RTs to words than
      pseudo-words. Left occipito/temporal N2 (240ms) was greater to high-frequency
      than low-frequency words and pseudo-words. According to the swLORETA inverse
      solution, the underlying neural source of this effect was located in the left
      fusiform gyrus of the occipital lobe (X=-29, Y=-66, Z=-10, BA19) and the right
      superior temporal gyrus (X=51, Y=6, Z=-5, BA22), which are probably involved in
      word recognition and semantic representation, respectively. Later frontal ERP
      components, LPN (300-350) and P3 (400-500), also showed strong lexical
      sensitivity, thus suggesting implicit semantic processes. The results shed some
      light on the possible neural substrate of visual reading disabilities such as
      developmental surface dyslexia or pure alexia.

TI  - Cortical auditory evoked potentials in children with developmental dysphasia.
PG  - 305-14
AB  - Like all auditory evoked potentials, the cortical auditory evoked potentials are 
      nonspecific for the disease, but they provide information about the auditory
      system function. It appears that the cortical auditory potentials can be used to 
      study the disorders of speech comprehension and their pathology is related to the
      role of the temporal processing of the auditory stimuli. Cortical auditory
      potentials were studied in children with developmental dysphasia (DD) to examine 
      maturation of the central auditory pathways. Study 1 (group of 6-7 yr. old
      children with DD): the responses to verbal stimuli (P3 waves) were recorded with 
      prolonged latencies from the left dominant hemisphere. Study 2: the latencies of 
      P2 waves (to tonal stimuli) were being shortened within age-comparison of groups 
      of 6-7 and 9-10 yr. old children with DD. Great variability in P2 and P3
      latencies, and their prolongation, compared to normal healthy children, reflects 
      functional changes in the central hearing function. Latency differences may be
      related to a common temporal deficit to be one of the possible underlying factors
      in developmental dysphasia. The underlying phenomenon may be connected to
      cortical auditory processing.

TI  - [Phonological remediation program in students with developmental dyslexia].
PG  - 31-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: program for phonological remediation in developmental dyslexia. AIM: 
      to verify the efficacy of a program for phonological remediation in students with
      developmental dyslexia. Specific goals of this study involved the comparison of
      the linguistic-cognitive performance of students with developmental dyslexia with
      that of students considered good readers; to compare the results obtained in pre 
      and post-testing situations of students with dyslexia who were and were not
      submitted to the program; and to compare the results obtained with the
      phonological remediation program in students with developmental dyslexia to those
      obtained in good readers. METHOD: participants of this study were 24 students who
      were divided as follows: Group I (GI) was divided in two other groups - GIe with 
      6 students with developmental dyslexia who were submitted to the program; and GIc
      with 6 students with developmental dyslexia who were not submitted to the
      program; Group II (GII) was also divided in two other groups - GIIe with 6 good
      readers who were submitted to the program, and GIIc with 6 good readers who were 
      not submitted to the program. The phonological remediation program (Gonzalez &
      Rosquete, 2002) was developed in three stages: pre-testing, training and
      post-testing. RESULTS: results indicate that GI presented a lower performance in 
      phonological skills, reading and writing when compared to GII in the pre-testing 
      situation. However, GIe presented a similar performance to that of GII in the
      post-testing situation, indicating the effectiveness of the phonological
      remediation program in students with developmental dyslexia. CONCLUSION: this
      study made evident the effectiveness of the phonological remediation program in
      students with developmental dyslexia.

TI  - What phonological deficit?
PG  - 129-41
AB  - We review a series of experiments aimed at understanding the nature of the
      phonological deficit in developmental dyslexia. These experiments investigate
      input and output phonological representations, phonological grammar, foreign
      speech perception and production, and unconscious speech processing and lexical
      access. Our results converge on the observation that the phonological
      representations of people with dyslexia may be intact, and that the phonological 
      deficit surfaces only as a function of certain task requirements, notably
      short-term memory, conscious awareness, and time constraints. In an attempt to
      reformulate those task requirements more economically, we propose that
      individuals with dyslexia have a deficit in access to phonological
      representations. We discuss the explanatory power of this concept and we
      speculate that a similar notion might also adequately describe the nature of
      other associated cognitive deficits when present.

TI  - What can autism and dyslexia tell us about intelligence?
PG  - 116-28
AB  - This paper argues that understanding developmental disorders requires developing 
      theories and models that explicitly represent the role of general intelligence in
      the cognitive phenotype of the disorder. In the case of autism it is argued that 
      the low-IQ scores of people with autism are not likely to be due to a deficit in 
      the cognitive process that is arguably the major cause of mental retardation -
      namely, speed of processing - but rather low IQ reflects the pervasive and
      cascading effects of the deficit in the information-processing module that causes
      autism. In the case of dyslexia, two radically different models of reading
      disorder (ability = disability and a modular deficit model) are likely to be
      influenced by the effect of general intelligence on reading performance in ways
      that will remain unclear without an explicit model of how general intelligence
      influences reading.

      1966-2006.
PG  - 16-26
AB  - Uta Frith has made a major contribution to our understanding of developmental
      disorders, especially autism and dyslexia. She has studied the cognitive and
      neurobiological bases of both disorders and demonstrated distinctive impairments 
      in social cognition and central coherence in autism, and in phonological
      processing in dyslexia. In this enterprise she has encouraged psychologists to
      work in a theoretical framework that distinguishes between observed behaviour and
      the underlying cognitive and neurobiological processes that mediate that
      behaviour.

TI  - Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia.
PG  - R1042-3
AB  - Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a specific learning disability affecting the
      acquisition of school-level mathematical abilities in the context of otherwise
      normal academic achievement, with prevalence estimates in the order of 3-6%.
      Behavioural studies show deficits in elementary numerical processing among
      individuals with pure DD, indicating that deficits in higher-level mathematical
      skills may stem from impaired representation and processing of basic numerical
      magnitude. Adult neuropsychological and neuroimaging research points to the
      intraparietal sulcus as a key region for the representation and processing of
      numerical magnitude. This raises the possibility of a parietal dysfunction as a
      root cause of DD. We show that, in children with pure DD, the right intraparietal
      sulcus is not modulated in response to numerical processing demands to the same
      degree as in typically developing children. This finding provides the first
      direct evidence for a specific impairment of parietal magnitude systems in DD
      during non-symbolic numerosity processing.

TI  - ERP evidence for the split fovea theory.
PG  - 212-20
AB  - According to the 'bilateral representation theory', a complete copy of the words 
      presented foveally is received simultaneously in the left and right visual
      cortices. However, a growing body of observations, which has led to the 'split
      fovea theory', proposes a functional split of the foveal area between the two
      hemispheres. In the present study we tested these two accounts using an adapted
      version of the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. Ten control participants and ten
      participants with developmental dyslexia undergoing electroencephalographic
      recordings were asked to identify one of five letters in a string. The target
      letter was systematically presented at fixation but the horizontal positioning of
      the letter string was varied such that the stimulus fluctuated in both the visual
      hemifields over the experiment. ERP results showed that letter strings
      encompassing the foveal field were not sent to both cerebral hemispheres
      simultaneously when fixation coincided with extreme letter positions (i.e., first
      or last). Indeed, the P1 peak was delayed in this case, which was interpreted as 
      the result of a transfer of visual information from the contralateral hemisphere 
      via the splenium of the corpus callosum. Consistent with the 'split fovea
      theory', this result suggests that a minimal amount of graphic input is necessary
      to induce a P1 event. The interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) deducted from
      peak-to-peak P1 latency delays ranged from 26 to 42 ms. As previously observed,
      the IHTT was significantly faster for right-to-left than left-to-right transfer
      in the control group. IHTT was marginally shorter in control participants as
      compared to participants with developmental dyslexia, and the faster transfer to 
      the left hemisphere seen in the former was not found in the latter.

TI  - A structural basis for reading fluency: white matter defects in a genetic brain
      malformation.
PG  - 2146-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that developmental dyslexia
      may be associated with abnormalities of neuronal migration or axonal
      connectivity. In patients with periventricular nodular heterotopia--a rare
      genetic brain malformation characterized by misplaced nodules of gray matter
      along the lateral ventricles--a specific and unexpected reading disability is
      present, despite normal intelligence. We sought to investigate the cognitive and 
      structural brain bases of this phenomenon. METHODS: Ten adult subjects with
      heterotopia, 10 with dyslexia, and 10 normal controls were evaluated, using a
      battery of neuropsychometric measures. White matter integrity and fiber tract
      organization were examined in six heterotopia subjects, using diffusion tensor
      imaging methods. RESULTS: Subjects with heterotopia and those with developmental 
      dyslexia shared a common behavioral profile, with specific deficits in reading
      fluency. Individuals with dyslexia seemed to have a more prominent phonological
      impairment than heterotopia subjects. Periventricular nodular heterotopia was
      associated with specific, focal disruptions in white matter microstructure and
      organization in the vicinity of gray matter nodules. The degree of white matter
      integrity correlated with reading fluency in this population. CONCLUSIONS: We
      demonstrate that a genetic disorder of gray matter heterotopia shares behavioral 
      characteristics with developmental dyslexia, and that focal white matter defects 
      in this disorder may serve as the structural brain basis of this phenomenon. Our 
      findings represent a potential model for the use of developmental brain
      malformations in the investigation of abnormal cognitive function.

TI  - Impaired tuning of a fast occipito-temporal response for print in dyslexic
      children learning to read.
PG  - 3200-10
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is defined as a disorder of learning to read. It is thus
      critical to examine the neural processes that impair learning to read during the 
      early phase of reading acquisition, before compensatory mechanisms are adapted by
      older readers with dyslexia. Using electroencephalography-based event-related
      imaging, we investigated how tuning of visual activity for print advances in the 
      same children before and after initial reading training in school. The focus was 
      on a fast, coarse form of visual tuning for print, measured as an increase of the
      occipito-temporal N1 response at 150-270 ms in the event-related potential (ERP) 
      to words compared to symbol strings. The results demonstrate that the initial
      development of reading skills and visual tuning for print progressed more slowly 
      in those children who became dyslexic than in their control peers. Print-specific
      tuning in 2nd grade strongly distinguished dyslexic children from controls. It
      was maximal in the inferior occipito-temporal cortex, left-lateralized in
      controls, and reduced in dyslexic children. The results suggest that delayed
      initial visual tuning for print critically contributes to the development of
      dyslexia.

AB  - This study compared the effectiveness of two reading treatment programmes for two
      contrasting developmental dyslexics. W.B. demonstrated "pure" phonological
      dyslexia (deficient nonword reading but normal irregular-word reading) and N.S.
      "pure" surface dyslexia (the converse pattern). Both participants completed: (a) 
      a phonological programme, which targeted the sublexical reading procedure through
      repeated exposure to word "families" with the same grapheme-phoneme
      correspondence (GPC; e.g., frail, raid, bait); and (b) a whole-word programme,
      which targeted the lexical reading procedure through tasks that emphasize
      whole-word visual analysis (e.g., speeded identification of visually degraded
      words). Both participants improved after training on the targeted words and/or
      GPCs. However, W.B. demonstrated reliable generalization only following the
      phonological programme and only in his reading of nonwords. In contrast, N.S.
      showed generalization across all types of word materials following both
      programmes. Although the whole-word programme (in particular the degraded-images 
      technique) resulted in numerically greater improvement for N.S., this difference 
      was not significant. Practical and theoretical implications of these results are 
      discussed.

AB  - We present results of analysis of overnight sleep video-EEG in 8 patients with
      developmental dysphasia and rolandic discharges. We evaluated the incidence of
      epileptiform discharges (expressed as paroxysmal activity density) at one or more
      electrodes in different sleep stages in three different periods of the night
      (after falling asleep, around midnight and before awakening). The difference of
      paroxysmal activity density was never higher than 21%, indicating that
      quantifying the discharges in the whole night recording is not necessary. We also
      showed that two independent foci may differ in the frequency of discharges. We
      propose a scheme for evaluation of EEG reflecting both frequency and distribution
      of discharges.

TI  - Cooccurrence of problems in activity level, attention, psychosocial adjustment,
      reading and writing in children with developmental coordination disorder.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to investigate the cooccurrence of problems in
      activity level, attention, reading, writing and psychosocial adjustment of
      children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). A parent-report
      questionnaire, the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire - Chinese
      version (DCDQ-C), was used to screen first to third graders from 13 mainstream
      schools in Taipei. Two standardized motor tests were then administered to those
      who scored below 10% on the DCDQ-C. Tests of activity level, attention, reading, 
      writing and psychosocial adjustment were then administered to this sample.
      Thirty-eight children identified as DCD, 32 as suspect for DCD and 82 as normal
      comparison were included in the final sample. Multivariate analysis of variance
      comparing the three groups (DCD, suspect DCD, and comparison) revealed that both 
      children with DCD and suspect for DCD obtained significantly poorer scores on
      measures of attention and reading, and were more hyperactive than comparison
      children. Children with DCD and suspect for DCD were also reported to have more
      internalizing and social problems than children without motor problems. No
      significant differences, however, were noted between children with different
      degree of motor coordination problems (categorized as DCD and suspect for DCD) on
      any measure. Furthermore, a high percentage of children in both the DCD and
      suspect groups fell in the clinical range of attention, activity level and
      psychosocial adjustment problems. The results revealed a high risk for these
      problems in nonreferred children with motor coordination problems. The high
      percentage of clinical range behavioral problems warrants attention of clinicians
      who work with children with motor coordination difficulties to the need to
      promote early identification and referral.

TI  - The effect of social disadvantage on motor development in young children: a
      comparative study.
PG  - 1214-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Empirical research suggests that social disadvantage has a negative
      effect on the development of language, and related cognitive skills such as
      reading. There is, however, no corresponding body of research on the impact of
      social disadvantage on motor development. The primary purpose of this study was
      to investigate the impact of social disadvantage on motor development in young
      children. In addition, we explored a possible link between an early neuromotor
      indicator and attainments in language, and reading. METHODS: The Northern Ireland
      Multiple Deprivation Measure was used to identify two contrasting districts based
      on a composite measure of social disadvantage. We investigated the effect of
      social disadvantage on the motor attainments of a sample of 239 children aged 4-5
      years, and 276 children aged 7-8 years attending mainstream schools in each
      district using a standardised motor assessment battery, and a motor
      neurodevelopmental measure. We used standardised receptive language and reading
      assessments to evaluate possible associations between motor and language/reading 
      attainments. RESULTS: There was a significant negative effect of social
      disadvantage on motor skills, for both age groups, and for both males and
      females. A similar negative effect of social disadvantage on attainments in
      language, and reading was also found. Children from areas of social disadvantage 
      had significant deficits in motor and receptive language attainments relative to 
      their more advantaged peers. In addition, we revealed a significant predictive
      relationship between a neurodevelopmental measure of early motor development and 
      reading attainment. CONCLUSIONS: Children growing up in socially disadvantaged
      areas may be at particular risk of motor, including neurodevelopmental, delay, as
      well as language and reading difficulties. The determinants of motor and
      neuromotor deficits in children from disadvantaged backgrounds should be
      explored, and the relationship between early neuromotor development and
      language/reading development requires further investigation.

TI  - Reading exposure: a (largely) environmental risk factor with
      environmentally-mediated effects on reading performance in the primary school
      years.
PG  - 1192-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely believed that there are reciprocal links between reading
      achievement and reading exposure: children who read more do better at reading,
      and reading achievement itself promotes reading. We tested the hypotheses that
      these links arise because children's genetically influenced reading performance
      is correlated with their leisure-time reading exposure, and reading exposure, in 
      turn, may have an environmentally mediated effect on later reading performance.
      METHOD: The sample consisted of 3039 twin pairs from the UK Twins Early
      Development Study (TEDS). Reading exposure was assessed at age 10 using the
      Author Recognition Test (ART). Reading performance was assessed at ages 7 and 12 
      using the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE). RESULTS: ART scores were
      moderately correlated with TOWRE scores at ages 7 and 12. Shared environmental
      variance in 7-year TOWRE performance accounted for most of the contribution made 
      by 7-year TOWRE scores to the prediction of 10-year ART scores. Genetic
      influences on ART scores were modest, but this genetic variance almost completely
      reflected genetic variance in 7-year TOWRE scores. After controlling for genetic 
      and environmental influences that overlapped between 7-year TOWRE and 10-year ART
      scores, there was evidence for a separate link between 10-year ART and 12-year
      TOWRE that was due to shared environmental influences. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic
      influences on early reading achievement contribute to later propensities to seek 
      out reading experiences that might, in turn, reciprocally influence reading
      achievement through shared environmental paths.

TI  - Disruption of neuronal migration by RNAi of Dyx1c1 results in neocortical and
      hippocampal malformations.
PG  - 2562-72
AB  - The brains of individuals with developmental dyslexia have neocortical neuronal
      migration abnormalities including molecular layer heterotopias, laminar
      dysplasias, and periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH). RNA interference
      (RNAi) of Dyx1c1, a candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, disrupts neuronal
      migration in developing embryonic neocortex. Using in utero electroporation, we
      cotransfected cells in the rat neocortical ventricular zone (VZ) at E14/15 with
      short hairpin RNA vectors targeting Dyx1c1 along with either plasmids encoding
      enhanced green fluorescent protein or plasmids encoding monomeric red fluorescent
      protein only. RNAi of Dyx1c1 resulted in pockets of unmigrated neurons resembling
      PNH. The pattern of migration of transfected neurons was bimodal, with
      approximately 20% of the neurons migrating a short distance from the VZ and
      another 40% that migrated past their expected lamina. Approximately 25% of the
      transfected brains had hippocampal pyramidal cell migration anomalies. Molecular 
      layer ectopias, which were not related to injection site artifacts, were also
      seen in 25% of the animals. These results support the hypothesis that targeted
      disruption of the candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, Dyx1c1, results in
      neuronal migration disorders similar to those seen in the brains of dyslexics.

TI  - Number development and developmental dyscalculia.
PG  - 868-73
AB  - There is a growing consensus that the neuropsychological underpinnings of
      developmental dyscalculia (DD) are a genetically determined disorder of 'number
      sense', a term denoting the ability to represent and manipulate numerical
      magnitude nonverbally on an internal number line. However, this
      spatially-oriented number line develops during elementary school and requires
      additional cognitive components including working memory and number symbolization
      (language). Thus, there may be children with familial-genetic DD with deficits
      limited to number sense and others with DD and comorbidities such as language
      delay, dyslexia, or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. This duality is
      supported by epidemiological data indicating that two-thirds of children with DD 
      have comorbid conditions while one-third have pure DD. Clinically, they differ
      according to their profile of arithmetic difficulties. fMRI studies indicate that
      parietal areas (important for number functions), and frontal regions (dominant
      for executive working memory and attention functions), are under-activated in
      children with DD. A four-step developmental model that allows prediction of
      different pathways for DD is presented. The core-system representation of
      numerical magnitude (cardinality; step 1) provides the meaning of 'number', a
      precondition to acquiring linguistic (step 2), and Arabic (step 3) number
      symbols, while a growing working memory enables neuroplastic development of an
      expanding mental number line during school years (step 4). Therapeutic and
      educational interventions can be drawn from this model.

TI  - Motor impairment in dyslexia: the influence of attention disorders.
PG  - 368-74
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a heterogeneous syndrome with a phonological core
      deficit and frequent association with other developmental disorders.
      Controversies exist about the influence of motor difficulties frequently
      encountered in dyslexia. According to different theoretical approaches, these
      motor impairments would reflect either a frequent co-morbid entity or a
      cerebellar dysfunction that could constitute the causal factor of reading
      disabilities. The principal aim of this study was to determine the frequency of
      motor impairments in a population of children with phonological dyslexia and
      specify possible links with attention deficit. We analysed retrospectively motor 
      and attention abilities of 58 children with phonological dyslexia. An important
      sub-group of children with dyslexia (40-57% depending on the severity of motor
      difficulties) presented a motor impairment affecting co-ordination, balance and
      manual dexterity suggesting a cerebellar dysfunction. There was a significant
      association between attention deficit and motor impairments, with a specific
      impact on balance and co-ordination deficits. The comparison of performance in
      four groups defined according to the presence versus absence of attention deficit
      and motor impairment, respectively, were not in favour of a unequivocal causal
      link between reading disabilities and motor or attention disorders.

PG  - 491-502
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The recent identification and cloning of the first genes with a
      mutation linked to dyslexia is starting to allow researchers to achieve a more
      precise characterisation of both the disorder itself and the functioning of the
      neuronal circuits responsible for the ability to read and spell. DEVELOPMENT: The
      dyslexia-related genes that have been characterised to date appear to be involved
      in controlling the migration of certain neuronal lineages, as well as in
      regulating axonal growth. Furthermore, there seems to be a satisfactory match
      between their dysfunction and some of the structural and functional anomalies
      detected in individuals affected by the disorder. In some cases there has been a 
      positive selection of certain modifications to their sequencing during the recent
      developmental history of the human kind. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis of the
      endophenotypes associated with dyslexia and the search for the alleles that make 
      the individual susceptible to the disorder (apart from the search for the genes
      that have a direct influence in the disorder, which researchers are beginning
      identify) will make it possible, some time in the future, to reach a more precise
      characterisation of the components of the genetic regulation programme that
      modulates the organisation and activity of the neuronal centres related to the
      capacity to read. Many of these centres are likely to be common to other
      programmes governing the development of neuronal circuits linked to linguistic
      processing and the learning and acquisition of new capacities. It will also make 
      it possible to carry out a more exact assessment of how this programme is
      affected by the molecular and ontogenetic context, as well as by the environment 
      in which the individual grows up.

AB  - Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience methods reveal the potential of
      neuroimaging as be a useful tool in clinical and educational practice. In this
      review, we review the literature and provide evidence that functional and
      structural neuroimaging can detect changes with treatment. Further, we show
      promising initial results showing that the addition of neuroimaging measures can 
      enhance conventional methods to predict outcome and prognosis. Examples are drawn
      from disorders such as attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
      depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), temporal lobe
      epilepsy, Alzheimer disease and developmental dyslexia. This evidence raises the 
      intriguing possibility of utilizing neuroimaging data as a critical component in 
      assessing and predicting cognitive abilities and

TI  - Association of short-term memory with a variant within DYX1C1 in developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 640-6
AB  - A substantial genetic contribution in the etiology of developmental dyslexia (DD)
      has been well documented with independent groups reporting a susceptibility locus
      on chromosome 15q. After the identification of the DYX1C1 gene as a potential
      candidate for DD, several independent association studies reported controversial 
      results. We performed a family-based association study to determine whether the
      DYX1C1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been associated with DD
      before, that is SNPs '-3GA' and '1249GT', influence a broader phenotypic
      definition of DD. A significant linkage disequilibrium was observed with 'Single 
      Letter Backward Span' (SLBS) in both single-marker and haplotype analyses. These 
      results provide further support to the association between DD and DYX1C1 and it
      suggests that the linkage disequilibrium with DYX1C1 is more saliently explained 
      in Italian dyslexics by short-term memory, as measured by 'SLBS', than by the
      categorical diagnosis of DD or other related phenotypes.

PG  - 653-5
AB  - Dore Achievement Centres are springing up world-wide with a mission to cure
      cerebellar developmental delay, thought to be the cause of dyslexia,
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyspraxia and Asperger's syndrome.
      Remarkable success is claimed for an exercise-based treatment that is designed to
      accelerate cerebellar development. Unfortunately, the published studies are
      seriously flawed. On measures where control data are available, there is no
      credible evidence of significant gains in literacy associated with this
      intervention. There are no published studies on efficacy with the clinical groups
      for whom the programme is advocated. It is important that family practitioners
      and paediatricians are aware that the claims made for this expensive treatment
      are misleading.

AB  - Treatment effects of Fast ForWord, hypothesized to ameliorate temporal processing

      using four paradigms: Word/Non-word Reading (NW), Grapheme-to-Phoneme Matching
      (GP), Verbal, and Spatial Working Memory (VWM, SWM). Shifts in brain activation
      from right inferior frontal and temporal to left frontal, bilateral
      supramarginal, and transverse temporal regions occurred during GP. During NW,
      shifts progressed from (1) right or bilateral anterior and superior to (2) left, 
      inferior frontal, to (3) left, superior posterior temporoparietal, to (4) left,
      inferior, posterior temporooccipital regions. Reading and written language
      improvements were noted in passage comprehension and spelling.

TI  - [Phonological awareness, working memory, reading and writing performances in
      familial dyslexia].
PG  - 374-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: familial dyslexia. AIM: to characterize and compare the phonological 
      awareness, working memory, reading and writing abilities of individuals whose
      family members are also affected. METHOD: in this study 10 familial nuclei of
      natural family relationship of individuals with dyslexia were analyzed. Families 
      of natural individuals living in the west region of the state of Sao Paulo were
      selected. Inclusion criteria were: to be a native speaker of the Brazilian
      Portuguese language, to have 8 years of age or more, to present positive familial
      history for learning disabilities, that is, to present at least one relative with
      difficulties in learning. Exclusion criteria were: to present any neurological
      disorder genetically caused or not, in any of the family members, such as
      dystonia, extra pyramidal diseases, mental disorder, epilepsy, attention deficit 
      and hyperactivity disorder (ADHA); psychiatric symptoms or conditions; or any
      other pertinent conditions that could cause errors in the diagnosis. As for the
      diagnosis of developmental dyslexia, information about the familial history of
      the adolescents and children was gathered with the parents, so that a detailed
      pedigree could be delineated. Neurological, psychological, speech-language, and
      school performance evaluations were made with the individuals and their families.
      RESULTS: the results of this study suggest that the dyslexic individuals and
      their respective relatives, also with dyslexia, presented lower performances than
      the control group in terms of rapid automatic naming, reading, writing and
      phonological awareness. CONCLUSION: deficits in phonological awareness, working
      memory, reading and writing seem to have genetic susceptibility that possibly
      determine, when in interaction with the environment, the manifestation of
      dyslexia.

TI  - 'Anatomo-biological considerations on the centers of language': an Argentinian
      contribution to the 1906 Paris debate on aphasia.
PG  - 455-61
AB  - In 1906, the year of the renowned holistic-localizationist controversy between
      neurologists Pierre Marie and Jules Dejerine in Paris, Christfried Jakob, a
      protagonist researcher of the cerebral cortex at the time working in Argentina,
      published two relevant articles entitled 'Does Broca's area exist?' and
      'Anatomo-biological considerations on the centers of language'. The two articles 
      addressed neuropsychological and developmental aspects of language functions in
      normality and pathology with regard to the brain areas that subserve them. The
      present article provides an English translation of Jakob's second paper, on the
      embryonic and postnatal development of brain areas related to language. The
      information given and the views expressed may still shed, a century later, useful
      light on our understanding of brain-language relationships.

TI  - Cerebellar tasks do not distinguish between children with developmental dyslexia 
      and children with intellectual disability.
PG  - 389-407
AB  - This paper explored the claim that only children with developmental dyslexia,
      whose reading ability is discrepant from their average general reasoning ability 
      show specific deficits in motor tasks assessing cerebellar functioning (Fawcett
      et al., 2001, Cerebellar tests differentiate between groups of poor readers with 
      and without IQ discrepancy. J. Learning Disabilities, 34, 119) and rapid serial
      naming (RAN, Wolf & Bowers, 1999, The double deficit hypothesis for the
      developmental dyslexias. J. Educ. Psychol., 91, 1). All available children
      between the ages of 11 and 14 were recruited from two special schools for
      children with either (a) formally-diagnosed intellectual disabilities (N = 18);
      or (b) formal diagnoses of developmental dyslexia (N = 25). These two groups of
      children did not differ on gender, age, pseudoword decoding abilities, or on 7 of
      8 literacy measures, but did differ significantly, as expected on verbal and
      non-verbal reasoning tasks. Importantly, there were no deficits in bead threading
      ability or postural stability in the children with developmental dyslexia
      compared to the children with intellectual disabilities. There were also no
      between-group differences in rapid naming measures. The present results therefore
      provide no support for the claim that cerebellar deficits or RAN distinguish
      between children with dyslexia and children with intellectual disabilities that
      include reading.

      study of developmental surface dyslexia.
PG  - 623-60
LID - 10.1080/02643290701617330 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the visual word recognition ability of M.T., a young boy with
      surface dyslexia, by means of a paradigm that measures performance as a function 
      of the eye fixation position within the word, known as the "viewing-position
      effect" paradigm. In well-achieving readers, the viewing-position effect is
      mainly determined by factors affecting letter visibility and by lexical
      constraints on word recognition. We further quantified M.T.'s sensory limitations
      on letter visibility by computing visual-span profiles - that is, the number of
      letters recognizable at a glance. Finally, in an ideal-observer's perspective,
      M.T.'s performance was compared with a parameter-free model combining M.T.'s
      letter visibility data with a simple lexical matching rule. The results showed
      that M.T. did not use the whole visual information available on letter identities
      to recognize words and that preorthographical factors constrained his word
      recognition performance. The results can be best accounted for by a reduction of 
      the number of letters processed in parallel.

TI  - [Developmental dyslexia: the role of phonological processing for the development 
      of literacy].
PG  - 737-48
AB  - Successful early reading and spelling acquisition depends on a number of
      different skills. Of considerable importance is phonological processing, which is
      the processing of acoustic signals with linguistic content. Three areas of
      phonological processing have been found to be most important for reading and
      writing competence: phonological awareness, naming speed, and phonological
      working memory. Research on these components suggests that specific interventions
      tailored to individual phonological processing deficits may prevent later
      dyslexia. Therefore, it appears mandatory that ear-nose-throat physicians have at
      least a basic knowledge of the theory of phonological processing. This will
      enable proper consultation with parents of affected children.

TI  - Verbal and gestural communication in children with bilateral perisylvian
      polymicrogyria.
PG  - 1090-8
AB  - We assessed intelligence and receptive and expressive language skills in 6
      children, ages 7 years 9 months to 12 years 4 months, with bilateral perisylvian 
      polymicrogyria of variable extent and with dysarthria of different severity. In
      view of the recent findings of a close relationship between word and gesture, we 
      also examined the communicative use of gesture. We found that mental retardation 
      was related to the extent of cortical malformation; lexical comprehension, but
      not morphosyntactic comprehension, and verbal production were more compromised
      than expected from nonverbal intellectual abilities; lack of verbal language was 
      not compensated by the use of referential gestures. Results are discussed
      suggesting that compromised verbal and gestural communication in bilateral
      perisylvian polymicrogyria are not due simply to mental retardation and/or
      dysarthria but also to dysfunction of Sylvian fissure areas concerned with the
      totality of language processing.

PG  - 443-57
AB  - Forty-five Grade 3 students from a reservation school in Western Canada were
      divided into two remedial groups and a no-risk control group. One remedial group 
      was given a classroom-administered cognitive enhancement program (COGENT)
      throughout the school year. The second group received COGENT for the first half
      of the year followed by a pull-out cognitive-based reading enhancement program
      (PREP). Children were assessed across phonological awareness, rapid naming,
      reading, and cognitive ability at the beginning of the year, mid-term, and at the
      end of the school year. MANOVA results showed a significant interaction for
      reading measures, with students receiving classroom intervention over the school 
      year making the greatest gains. Results are discussed in terms of group,
      remediation program, and individual participant improvements.

TI  - Alternative splicing in the dyslexia-associated gene KIAA0319.
PG  - 627-34
AB  - The KIAA0319 gene in chromosome 6p22 has been strongly associated with
      developmental dyslexia. In this article we show a wide expression pattern of this
      gene in human adult brain by Northern blot analysis. We also performed RT-PCR
      analysis to detect alternative splicing variants in human brain. Most of the
      detected variants involve alternative splicing of the exons at the 5' and the 3' 
      ends. Two main forms differing in the length of the 5' UTR are detected at
      approximately the same rate. Two variants (B and C) lacking exon 19, which
      encodes the transmembrane domain, are the main alternative forms detected among
      those predicted to encode protein. These two variants could be secreted and might
      be involved in signaling functions. A similar RT-PCR analysis performed in mouse 
      and rat adult brains showed that only some of the alternative splicing variants
      are equivalent to those found in the human gene.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: the visual attention span deficit hypothesis.
PG  - 198-230
AB  - The visual attention (VA) span is defined as the amount of distinct visual
      elements which can be processed in parallel in a multi-element array. Both recent
      empirical data and theoretical accounts suggest that a VA span deficit might
      contribute to developmental dyslexia, independently of a phonological disorder.
      In this study, this hypothesis was assessed in two large samples of French and
      British dyslexic children whose performance was compared to that of
      chronological-age matched control children. Results of the French study show that
      the VA span capacities account for a substantial amount of unique variance in
      reading, as do phonological skills. The British study replicates this finding and
      further reveals that the contribution of the VA span to reading performance
      remains even after controlling IQ, verbal fluency, vocabulary and single letter
      identification skills, in addition to phoneme awareness. In both studies, most
      dyslexic children exhibit a selective phonological or VA span disorder. Overall, 
      these findings support a multi-factorial view of developmental dyslexia. In many 
      cases, developmental reading disorders do not seem to be due to phonological
      disorders. We propose that a VA span deficit is a likely alternative underlying
      cognitive deficit in dyslexia.

TI  - Brain structure correlates of component reading processes: implications for
      reading disability.
PG  - 777-91
AB  - Brain structures implicated in developmental dyslexia (reading disability - RD)
      vary greatly across structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies due to
      methodological differences regarding the definition of RD and the exact
      measurements of a specific brain structure. The current study attempts to resolve
      some of those methodological concerns by examining brain volume as it relates to 
      components of proposed RD subtypes. We performed individual regression analyses
      on total cerebral volume, neocortical volume, subcortical volume, 9 neo-cortical 
      structures and 2 sub-cortical structures. These analyses used three dimensions of
      reading, phonemic ability (PA), orthographic ability, and rapid naming (RN)
      ability, while accounting for total cerebral volume, age, and performance IQ
      (PIQ). Primary analyses included membership to a group (poor reader vs. good
      reader) in the analysis. The result was a significant interaction between PA and 
      reading ability as it predicts total cerebral volume. Analyses revealed that poor
      readers lacked a relationship between PA and brain size, but that good readers
      had a significant positive relationship. This pattern of interaction was not
      present for the other two reading component factors. These findings bring into
      question the general belief that individuals with RD are at the low end of a
      reading ability distribution and do not have a unique disorder. Additional
      analyses revealed only a few significant relationships between brain size and
      task performance, most notably a positive correlation between orthographic
      ability and the angular gyrus (AG), as well as a negative correlation between RN 
      ability and the parietal operculum (PO).

TI  - The relationship among receptive and expressive vocabulary, listening
      comprehension, pre-reading skills, word identification skills, and reading
      comprehension by children with reading disabilities.
PG  - 1093-109
AB  - PURPOSE: Some researchers (F. R. Vellutino, F. M. Scanlon, & M. S. Tanzman, 1994)
      have argued that the different domains comprising language (e.g., phonology,
      semantics, and grammar) may influence reading development in a differential
      manner and at different developmental periods. The purpose of this study was to
      examine proposed causal relationships among different linguistic subsystems and
      different measures of reading achievement in a group of children with reading
      disabilities. METHODS: Participants were 279 students in 2nd to 3rd grade who met
      research criteria for reading disability. Of those students, 108 were girls and
      171 were boys. In terms of heritage, 135 were African and 144 were Caucasian.
      Measures assessing pre-reading skills, word identification, reading
      comprehension, and general oral language skills were administered. RESULTS:
      Structural equation modeling analyses indicated receptive and expressive
      vocabulary knowledge was independently related to pre-reading skills.
      Additionally, expressive vocabulary knowledge and listening comprehension skills 
      were found to be independently related to word identification abilities.
      CONCLUSION: Results are consistent with previous research indicating that oral
      language skills are related to reading achievement (e.g., A. Olofsson & J.
      Niedersoe, 1999; H. S. Scarborough, 1990). Results from this study suggest that
      receptive and expressive vocabulary knowledge influence pre-reading skills in
      differential ways. Further, results suggest that expressive vocabulary knowledge 
      and listening comprehension skills facilitate word identification skills.

TI  - Patterns of developmental dyscalculia with or without dyslexia.
PG  - 217-25
AB  - This study has been conducted in order to investigate the extent to which some
      characteristics of dyscalculia may be common to dyslexia. Seven multiple
      single-cases were studied: two children with dyslexia only, two with dyscalculia 
      only, and three more children with comorbidity of dyslexia and dyscalculia. Each 
      participant was assessed with a standardized comprehensive battery of
      arithmetical, reading, and cognitive tests. We observed that a clinical
      impairment in mental and written calculations, arithmetical facts retrieval,
      number comparison, number alignment, and identification of arithmetical signs may
      appear with a normal reading capacity and independently of a short-term verbal
      memory deficit. These findings add convergent support to the evidence mainly
      obtained from group comparisons that the more distinctive characteristics of
      dyscalculia are functionally independent of dyslexia.

TI  - Comparing children with and without dyslexia on the Movement Assessment Battery
      for Children and the Test of Gross Motor Development.
PG  - 207-14
AB  - Dyslexia is the most commonly occurring learning disability in the United States,
      characterized by difficulties with word recognition, spelling, and decoding. A
      growing body of literature suggests that deficits in motor skill performance
      exist in the dyslexic population. This study compared the performance of children
      with and without dyslexia on different subtests of the Test of Gross Motor
      Development and Movement Assessment Battery for Children and assessed whether
      there were developmental changes in the scores of the dyslexic group.
      Participants included 26 dyslexic children (19 boys and 7 girls; 9.5 yr. old, SD 
      = 1.7) and 23 age- and sex-matched typically developing (17 boys and 6 girls; 9.9
      yr. old, SD = 1.3) children as a control group. Mann-Whitney U tests indicated
      that the dyslexic group performed significantly lower than the control group only
      on the Total Balance subtest of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children.
      Additionally, the young dyslexic group performed significantly better on the
      Total Balance subtest, compared to the older dyslexic group. These results
      suggest that cerebellar dysfunction may account for differences in performance.

TI  - Semantic, syntactic, and phonological processing of written words in adult
      developmental dyslexic readers: an event-related brain potential study.
PG  - 52
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study used event-related brain potentials to investigate 
      semantic, phonological and syntactic processes in adult German dyslexic and
      normal readers in a word reading task. Pairs of German words were presented one
      word at a time. Subjects had to perform a semantic judgment task (house-window;
      are they semantically related?), a rhyme judgment task (house-mouse; do they
      rhyme?) and a gender judgment task (das-Haus [the-house]; is the gender correct? 
      [in German, house has a neutral gender: das Haus]). RESULTS: Normal readers
      responded faster compared to dyslexic readers in all three tasks. Onset latencies
      of the N400 component were delayed in dyslexic readers in the rhyme judgment and 
      in the gender judgment task, but not in the semantic judgment task. N400 and the 
      anterior negativity peak amplitudes did not differ between the two groups.
      However, the N400 persisted longer in the dyslexic group in the rhyme judgment
      and in the semantic judgment tasks. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that
      dyslexics are phonologically impaired (delayed N400 in the rhyme judgment task)
      but that they also have difficulties in other, non-phonological aspects of
      reading (longer response times, longer persistence of the N400). Specifically,
      semantic and syntactic integration seem to require more effort for dyslexic
      readers and take longer irrespective of the reading task that has to be
      performed.

TI  - Delayed detection of tonal targets in background noise in dyslexia.
PG  - 80-90
AB  - Individuals with developmental dyslexia are often impaired in their ability to
      process certain linguistic and even basic non-linguistic auditory signals. Recent
      investigations report conflicting findings regarding impaired low-level binaural 
      detection mechanisms associated with dyslexia. Binaural impairment has been
      hypothesized to stem from a general low-level processing disorder for temporally 
      fine sensory stimuli. Here we use a new behavioral paradigm to address this
      issue. We compared the response times of dyslexic listeners and their matched
      controls in a tone-in-noise detection task. The tonal signals were either Huggins
      Pitch (HP), a stimulus requiring binaural processing to elicit a pitch percept,
      or a pure tone-perceptually similar but physically very different signals. The
      results showed no difference between the two groups specific to the processing of
      HP and thus no evidence for a binaural impairment in dyslexia. However, dyslexic 
      subjects exhibited a general difficulty in extracting tonal objects from
      background noise, manifested by a globally delayed detection speed.

TI  - Using mismatch negativity to study central auditory processing in developmental
      language and literacy impairments: where are we, and where should we be going?
PG  - 651-72
AB  - A popular theoretical account of developmental language and literacy disorders
      implicates poor auditory temporal processing in their etiology, but evidence from
      studies using behavioral measures has yielded inconsistent results. The mismatch 
      negativity (MMN) component of the auditory event-related potential has been
      recommended as an alternative, relatively objective, measure of the brain's
      ability to discriminate sounds that is suitable for children with limited
      attention or motivation. A literature search revealed 26 studies of the MMN in
      individuals with dyslexia or specific language impairment and 4 studies of
      infants or children at familial risk of these disorders. Findings were highly
      inconsistent. Overall, attenuation of the MMN and atypical lateralization in the 
      clinical group were most likely to be found in studies using rapidly presented
      stimuli, including nonverbal sounds. The MMN literature offers tentative support 
      for the hypothesis that auditory temporal processing is impaired in language and 
      literacy disorders, but the field is plagued by methodological inconsistencies,
      low reliability of measures, and low statistical power. The article concludes
      with recommendations for improving this state of affairs.

      control children have been followed from birth. In this paper we report data on

      1,750 children from four measurement points during the first two school years. In
      the total sample, we examined whether heterogeneous developmental paths can be
      identified based on profiles of word recognition and reading comprehension.
      Secondly, we studied what kind of early language and literacy skill profiles and 
      reading experiences characterize the children with differing reading development 
      in the follow-up sample. The mixture modeling procedure resulted in five
      subtypes: (1) poor readers, (2) slow decoders, (3) poor comprehenders, (4)
      average readers, and (5) good readers. The children with familial risk for
      dyslexia performed on average at a lower level in all reading tasks than both
      their classmates and the controls, and they were overrepresented in slow decoders
      subtype. Differences between the subtypes were found in the early language and
      literacy skill development, as well as in the reading experiences of the reading 
      subtypes.

TI  - Tic disorders and ADHD: answers from a world-wide clinical dataset on Tourette
      syndrome.
PG  - 15-23
LID - 10.1007/s00787-007-1003-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with frequent
      comorbidity with Attention- deficit-Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The impact of 
      this association is still a matter of debate. METHOD: Using the TIC database
      containing 6,805 cases, the clinical differences were ascertained between
      subjects with and without ADHD. RESULTS: The reported prevalence of ADHD in TS
      was 55%, within the range of many other reports. If the proband was diagnosed
      with ADHD, a family history of ADHD was much more likely. ADHD was associated
      with earlier diagnosis of TS and a much higher rate of anger control problems,
      sleep problems, specific learning disability, OCD, Oppositional-defiant disorder,
      mood disorder, social skill deficits, sexually inappropriate behaviour, and
      self-injurious behaviour. Subjects with seizures and with Developmental
      Coordination Disorder also had high rates of ADHD. Anxiety disorder, however, was
      not more frequent. Preliminary data suggest that most behavioural difficulties in
      ADHD are associated with the Combined or Hyperactive-Impulsive Subtypes of ADHD. 
      Every large site (>200 cases) had a significantly increased rate of anger control
      problems in cases with ADHD. CONCLUSION: Subjects with TS have high rates of ADHD
      and complex associations with other disorders. Clinically the findings confirm
      other research indicating the importance of ADHD in understanding the behavioural
      problems often associated with the diagnosis of TS. Additional ADHD comorbidity
      should be taken into account in diagnosis, management, and training.

AB  - Linkages between literacy attainment and poverty have been well documented in the
      literature. This article reviews the literacy challenges for low-income children 
      and the need for child health practitioners to be informed about children's
      literacy environments. The authors define literacy and emphasize that literacy is
      a continuous developmental process that includes listening, speaking, reading,
      and writing. Read Out and Read is a national model that has demonstrated its
      effectiveness to improve receptive and expressive language development in
      children. Pediatricians are uniquely positioned to address early child's literacy
      development because they are often the only practitioner regularly encountering
      parents, infants, and children during the preschool years.

TI  - Management of dyslexia, its rationale, and underlying neurobiology.
PG  - 609-23, viii
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by an unexpected difficulty in reading in
      children and adults who otherwise possess the intelligence and motivation
      considered necessary for accurate and fluent reading. Dyslexia is the most common
      and most carefully studied of the learning disabilities, affecting 80% of all
      individuals identified as learning disabled. Although in the past the diagnosis
      and implications of dyslexia were often uncertain, recent advances in the
      knowledge of the epidemiology, the neurobiology, the genetics, and the cognitive 
      influences on the disorder now allow the disorder to be approached within the
      framework of a traditional medical model. This article reviews these advances and
      their implications for the approach to patients presenting with a possible
      reading disability.

AB  - The authors review the neuropsychology, brain bases, and genetics of three
      related disorders of language development: reading disability, or developmental
      dyslexia (RD); language impairment (LI); and speech sound disorder (SSD). Over
      the past three decades, cognitive analysis has demonstrated that the reading
      difficulties of most children who have RD result from phonologic impairments
      (difficulties processing the sound structure of language). Although understanding
      of LI and SSD is somewhat less developed, both disorders are also associated with
      phonologic impairments, which may account for their comorbidity with RD. Research
      across levels of analysis is progressing rapidly to promote understanding not
      only of each disorder by itself but also of the relationships of the three
      disorders to each other.

AB  - Reading skills progress in a stage-like manner. There is no evidence that
      reading, unlike language, develops without direct instruction. Failing to develop
      preceding skills has a dramatic impact on development of more sophisticated
      cognitive skills. For example, children who have poor phonemic sensitivity
      struggle to develop phonetic decoding; poor word recognition and word decoding
      skills have a negative impact on reading comprehension. Primary care physicians
      need to be aware of reading problems and frequent comorbid conditions.
      Recognition of risk factors can help physicians direct children early to badly
      needed resources, which, at the least, decreases the risk for and minimize the
      impact of one additional challenge for these children.

PG  - 260-78
LID - 10.1080/02643290601181791 [doi]
AB  - Two studies were conducted to investigate visual attention deficits in dyslexia. 
      In Experiment 1, adults with dyslexia and age- and IQ-matched controls completed 
      a simple cueing task; participants responded to briefly presented (20 ms)
      eccentric targets (3 degrees , 6 degrees , or 9 degrees ) with a key press. In
      Experiment 2, the same participants completed a saccade version of the task, and 
      saccade amplitude, accuracy, and latency were measured. The results revealed
      comparable performance between the groups on the manual reaction time task. The
      groups also performed similarly in saccade accuracy and latency. Moreover,
      neither group showed a visual field asymmetry in their performance, with the
      exception that adults with dyslexia showed longer saccade latency for 9 degrees
      targets presented to their left visual field than did controls. However, on the
      latter measure, the majority (78%) of those with dyslexia performed within the
      range of the control group. Correlational analyses revealed associations between 
      reading and phoneme awareness in both groups, but phoneme awareness was not
      associated with visual attention in adult dyslexics. Together, the results are
      not compatible with a visual attention deficit in adult dyslexia, while they
      provide support for the phonological deficit hypothesis.

TI  - Deficient morphological processing in adults with developmental dyslexia: another
      barrier to efficient word recognition?
PG  - 110-29
AB  - Research on dyslexia has focused on the phonological level of linguistic
      analysis. Here we extend the investigation of the linguistic competence of
      individuals with dyslexia to the morphological level of linguistic analysis. We
      examine whether adult Hebrew readers with dyslexia extract and represent
      morphemic units similarly to normal readers. Using the priming paradigm in the
      word fragment completion task, we measured the magnitude of morphological priming
      and contrasted this effect with the repetition priming effect. Students with
      normal reading ability showed the typical repetition priming effect. A comparable
      repetition priming effect was also found for the dyslexic group as a whole.
      However, when the dyslexics were classified into three subtypes according to
      their phonological and orthographic decoding skills, repetition priming effects
      were significant only for the phonological dyslexia subgroup but not for the
      surface or mixed dyslexia subgroups. Furthermore, students with normal reading
      ability showed strong morphological priming, comparable in strength to the
      repetition priming effect. In contrast, the dyslexic readers did not show
      morphological priming, neither the dyslexia group as a whole, nor any of the
      subgroups. Our results highlight an additional source for dyslexics' difficulties
      with word recognition which lie at the level of morphological processing.

TI  - Follow-up of an exercise-based treatment for children with reading difficulties.
PG  - 78-96
AB  - This study reports the results of a long-term follow-up of an exercise-based
      approach to dyslexia-related disorders (Reynolds, Nicolson, & Hambly, Dyslexia,
      2003; 9(1): 48-71). In the initial study, children at risk of dyslexia were
      identified in 3 years of a junior school. One half then undertook a 6 month,
      home-based exercise programme. Evaluation after 6 months indicated that the
      exercise group improved significantly more than the controls on a range of
      cognitive and motor skills. Critics had suggested that the improvement might be
      attributable to artifactual issues including Hawthorne effects; an initial
      literacy imbalance between the groups; and inclusion of non-dyslexic
      participants. The present study evaluated the issue of whether the gains were
      maintained over the following 18 months, and whether they were in some sense
      artifactual as postulated by critics of the original study. Comparison of
      (age-adjusted) initial and follow-up performance indicated significant gains in
      motor skill, speech/language fluency, phonology, and working memory. Both
      dyslexic and non-dyslexic low achieving children benefited. There was also a
      highly significant reduction in the incidence of symptoms of inattention.
      Interestingly there were no significant changes in speeded tests of reading and
      spelling, but there was a significant improvement in (age-adjusted) reading
      (NFER). It is concluded that the gains were indeed long-lasting, and that the
      alternative hypotheses based on potential artifacts were untenable, and that the 
      exercise treatment therefore achieved its applied purpose. Further research is
      needed to determine the underlying reasons for the benefits. Possible (and
      potentially synergistic) explanations include: improved cerebellar function
      (neural level); improved learning ability and/or attentional ability (cognitive
      level); improved self-esteem and self-efficacy (affective level); and improved
      parental/familial support (social level).

TI  - Subject-verb agreement and phonological processing in developmental dyslexia and 
      specific language impairment (SLI): a closer look.
PG  - 293-305
AB  - BACKGROUND: Problems with subject-verb agreement and phonological (processing)
      skills have been reported to occur in children with specific language impairment 
      (SLI) and in those with developmental dyslexia, but only a few studies have
      compared such problems in these two groups. Previous studies have claimed a
      causal relationship between phonological processing deficits and morphosyntactic 
      problems. AIMS: The following questions were addressed in this study: (1) Are
      children with developmental dyslexia and SLI comparable in the level of
      sensitivity to subject-verb agreement, phonological awareness, and non-word
      repetition? (2) Are children with developmental dyslexia and SLI comparable in
      their performance profiles on tasks tapping subject-verb agreement, phonological 
      awareness, and non-word repetition? (3) Are deficits in phonological processing
      skills related to morphosyntactic deficits? METHODS & PROCEDURES: Forty-five
      children (mean age = 8;6 years) with developmental dyslexia, SLI and typically
      developing children participated. The sensitivity to subject-verb agreement,
      phonological awareness, and non-word repetition was measured. OUTCOMES & RESULTS:
      Both the children with dyslexia and with SLI made more errors than the control
      children on the subject-verb agreement task, with the children with dyslexia
      scoring significantly better than the children with SLI. Similarly, the children 
      with SLI and dyslexia both performed more poorly on the phoneme-deletion task
      than the control group. Both clinical groups performed more poorly on the
      non-word repetition task than the control children, with the children with
      dyslexia outperforming the children with SLI. In all three tasks differences in
      performance profiles were found between the children with developmental dyslexia 
      and SLI. Across all three groups non-word repetition was correlated with
      morphosyntactic sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The results show similarities between
      the performances of children with SLI and dyslexia on tasks tapping subject-verb 
      agreement, phonological awareness, and non-word repetition: they scored more
      poorly than typically developing children. Qualitative analyses revealed,
      however, differences in the error patterns on all three tasks. Associations
      between non-word repetition and sensitivity to subject-verb agreement were found,
      suggesting that problems with phonological processing impact on morphosyntactic
      skills.

TI  - Annotation: what electrical brain activity tells us about brain function that
      other techniques cannot tell us - a child psychiatric perspective.
PG  - 415-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring brain processes in real time requires genuine subsecond
      resolution to follow the typical timing and frequency of neural events.
      Non-invasive recordings of electric (EEG/ERP) and magnetic (MEG) fields provide
      this time resolution. They directly measure neural activations associated with a 
      wide variety of brain states and processes, even during sleep or in infants.
      Mapping and source estimation can localise these time-varying activation patterns
      inside the brain. METHODS: Recent EEG/ERP research on brain functions in the
      domains of attention and executive functioning, perception, memory, language,
      emotion and motor processing in ADHD, autism, childhood-onset schizophrenia,
      Tourette syndrome, specific language disorder and developmental dyslexia,
      anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression is reviewed. RESULTS: Over
      the past two decades, electrophysiology has substantially contributed to the
      understanding of brain functions during normal development, and psychiatric
      conditions of children and adolescents. Its time resolution has been important to
      measure covert processes, and to distinguish cause and effect. CONCLUSIONS: In
      the future, EEG/ERP parameters will increasingly characterise the interplay of
      neural states and information processing. They are particularly promising tools
      for multilevel investigations of etiological pathways and potential predictors of
      clinical treatment response.

TI  - In search of subtypes of Chinese developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 61-83
AB  - The dual-route model offers a popular way to classify developmental dyslexia into
      phonological and surface subtypes. The current study examined whether this
      dual-route model could provide a framework for understanding the varieties of
      Chinese developmental dyslexia. Three groups of Chinese children (dyslexics,
      chronological-age controls, and reading-level controls) were tested on Chinese
      exception character reading, pseudocharacter reading (analogous to English
      nonword reading), novel word learning, and some phonological and orthographic
      skills. It was found that Chinese exception character reading and pseudocharacter
      reading were highly correlated and that orthographic skills was a better
      predictor of both Chinese exception character and pseudocharacter reading than
      was phonological skills. More than half (62%) of the children in the dyslexia
      sample were classified as belonging to the surface subtype, but no children were 
      classified as belonging to the phonological subtype. These results suggested that
      the lexical and sublexical routes in Chinese are highly interdependent or that
      there may be only one route from print to speech as suggested by the
      connectionist models. Chinese dyslexic children generally are characterized as
      having delays in various phonological and orthographic skills, but some, such as 
      those identified as surface dyslexics in the current study, are more severely
      impaired.

TI  - Efficacy of an intervention to improve fluency in children with developmental
      dyslexia in a regular orthography.
PG  - 203-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a method to improve
      reading fluency in children with dyslexia. The method, which we named
      "subsyllabic," was aimed at automatizing the recognition of syllables within
      words in connected texts, presented by ad hoc software. Two versions of this
      method--one self-paced and the other one with automatic syllable
      identification-were compared to a method based on phonemic awareness, assisted
      reading, and other psycholinguistic exercises. The efficacy of the two versions
      of the subsyllabic method was further studied by repeating the first version
      twice and the second version three times using an AB design, with each phase
      lasting approximately 3 months. This part of the study provided not only
      follow-up data but also useful information on if and how fluency may change after
      repeated treatment. Outcomes obtained by a total of 63 children with dyslexia
      suggested that the subsyllabic method was superior to the control method and that
      the use of an automatic presentation of target syllables produced better results.
      Furthermore, we observed that fluency improved approximately at the same rate
      after each treatment repetition. Our data support the possibility of improving
      reading fluency at a significant clinical level, at least for regular
      orthographies. The crucial component of the subsyllabic method seems to be the
      facilitation of syllable recognition within words in connected texts and the
      emphasis on their rapid recognition using an automatized procedure.

TI  - Morphological analogies in Hebrew-speaking university students with dyslexia
      compared with typically developing gradeschoolers.
PG  - 237-53
AB  - Little attention has been devoted to date to the study of morphological knowledge
      in individuals with developmental dyslexia. The current study compares the
      ability of Hebrew-speaking adult dyslexic students and gradeschool children to
      analyze written words into their morphological components, using a linguistic
      analogy task. Two sets of monolingual Hebrew-speaking participants--152 typically
      developing gradeschool children and 38 undergraduate students diagnosed with
      reading disabilities--were administered the Morphological Analogies Task. Results
      indicate an early ability of normally developing children to perform
      morphological analogies, while the adult dyslexic group performed on par with 3rd
      and 4th grade. Error analysis revealed that the overwhelming majority of the
      erroneous responses in all grades involved morphological strategies rather than
      the associative semantic strategy. However, the adult dyslexic students had many 
      more associative responses than the graderschoolers. This testifies to the
      reduced written morphological abilities of adult dyslexic students.

TI  - A familial factor in the development of colour agnosia.
PG  - 1961-5
AB  - An important aspect of research into the link between genes and behaviour
      concerns the identification of familial determination. There is evidence for
      familial factors in selective deficits, such as developmental dyslexia and
      developmental prosopagnosia. Colour agnosia concerns a selective
      neuropsychological condition in which colour perception is intact, while the
      identification and naming of colour is disrupted. We recently demonstrated that
      this deficit can occur as a developmental deficit. Here, we show that there is a 
      familial factor in the development of colour agnosia by reporting the colour
      processing abilities of the mother and the daughters of a man with developmental 
      colour agnosia.

TI  - Prisms throw light on developmental disorders.
PG  - 1921-30
AB  - Prism adaptation, in which the participant adapts to prismatic glasses that
      deflect vision laterally, is a specific test of cerebellar function. Fourteen
      dyslexic children (mean age 13.5 years); 14 children with developmental
      coordination disorder (DCD): 6 of whom had comorbid dyslexia; and 12 control
      children matched for age and IQ underwent prism adaptation (assessed by clay
      throwing accuracy to a 16.7 degrees visual displacement). All 8 DCD children, 5
      of the 6 children with comorbid DCD and dyslexia and 10 of the 14 dyslexic
      children showed an impaired rate of adaptation, thereby providing strong evidence
      of impaired cerebellar function in DCD and developmental dyslexia. Taken together
      with other emerging evidence of overlap between developmental disorders, these
      findings highlight the importance of complementing research on the individual
      disorders with research on the commonalities between the disorders.

TI  - Deviant neurophysiological responses to phonological regularities in speech in
      dyslexic children.
PG  - 1427-37
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is strongly associated with a phonological deficit. Yet,
      implicit phonological processing (in)capacities in dyslexia remain relatively
      unexplored. Here we use a neurophysiological response sensitive to
      experience-dependent auditory memory traces, the mismatch negativity (MMN), to
      investigate implicit phonological processing of natural speech in dyslexic and
      normally reading children. In a modified passive oddball design that minimizes
      the contribution of acoustic processes, we presented non-words that differed by
      the degree of phonotactic probability, i.e. the distributional frequency of
      phoneme combinations in a given language. Overall morphology of ERP responses to 
      the non-words indicated comparable processing of acoustic-phonetic stimulus
      differences in both children groups. Consistent with previous findings in adults,
      normally reading children showed a significantly stronger MMN response to the
      non-word with high phonotactic probability (notsel) as compared to the non-word
      with low phonotactic probability (notkel), suggesting auditory cortical tuning to
      statistical regularities of phoneme combinations. In contrast, dyslexic children 
      did not show this sensitivity to phonotactic probability. These findings indicate
      that the phonological problems often reported in dyslexia relate to a subtle
      deficit in the implicit phonetic-phonological processing of natural speech.

TI  - Behavioural and neurophysiological correlates of dyslexia in the continuous
      performance task.
PG  - 845-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether attentional difficulties are a "core" feature
      of developmental Dyslexia. METHODS: Behavioural indices and event related
      potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 10 dyslexic participants (ages 15.5-17.4)
      and 10 control participants (ages 14.4-18.3) in the Continuous Performance Task
      (CPT), an established test of attentional performance. Participants were screened
      to ensure that none was diagnosable as attention deficit (ADHD). RESULTS: There
      were no significant differences in mean reaction time, error rate or sustained
      attention between the groups. By contrast, the P3 amplitude was significantly
      smaller and its latency significantly longer for the dyslexic group. This
      component was significantly lateralised in controls, whereas in dyslexics it was 
      symmetrical. CONCLUSIONS: Under the relatively light workload conditions of the
      CPT, "pure" dyslexic participants showed no behavioural signs of attentional
      difficulties. The attenuated, delayed and symmetrical ERPs in our dyslexic group 
      may reflect abnormal information processing in the right parietal lobe and
      abnormal interhemispheric asymmetry in Dyslexia. SIGNIFICANCE: The behavioural
      data suggest that abnormal attentional performance is not a "core" feature of
      developmental Dyslexia, and highlight the importance of distinguishing between
      dyslexic participants with and without ADHD symptoms. The presence of
      electrophysiological markers of Dyslexia in CPT revealed the atypical brain
      organisation that characterises "pure" Dyslexia.

TI  - Dyslexia, learning, and pedagogical neuroscience.
PG  - 306-11
AB  - The explosion in neuroscientific knowledge has profound implications for
      education, and we advocate the establishment of the new discipline of
      'pedagogical neuroscience' designed to combine psychological, medical, and
      educational perspectives. We propose that specific learning disabilities provide 
      the crucible in which the discipline may be forged, illustrating the scope by
      consideration of developmental dyslexia. Current approaches have failed to
      establish consensus on fundamental issues such as theoretical causes, diagnostic 
      methods, and treatment strategies. We argue that these difficulties arise from
      diagnosis via behavioural or cognitive symptoms, even though they may arise from 
      diverse causes. Rather than an inconvenience, variability of secondary symptoms
      within and across learning disabilities can inform both diagnosis and treatment. 
      We illustrate how brain-based theories lead to radical restructuring of
      diagnostic methods and propose that there is an urgent need to develop genetic
      and brain-based diagnostic methods designed to lead to individually-appropriate
      remediation and treatment methods.

PG  - 380-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the consequences of proprioception changes induced by a
      postural treatment on cognitive disturbances in children suffering from
      developmental dyslexia. MATERIAL: and methods: Twenty male dyslexic children were
      treated with prisms within their spectacles and a postural treatment. A control
      group of dyslexics (n=13) only received spectacles without prisms. All
      participants were evaluated at the beginning of the study and 6 months later with
      reading impairment tests and postural examinations. RESULTS: Mean age was 11
      years and 5 months in the treated group and 11 years and 7 months in the control 
      group. Four children were excluded from the 6-month analysis because of poor
      compliance. All dyslexic children presented with a postural deficiency syndrome. 
      In 13 out of 16 treated children, dyslexia was improved at 6 months, especially
      for the global leximetric test and the reading of regular and irregular words.
      However, the treatment did not allow a complete recovery of reading ability when 
      compared with age-matched individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results show that postural
      modifications may favorably influence some clinical signs associated with
      developmental dyslexia. Further studies with a larger sample and with a longer
      follow-up period are required to better assess the role of postural treatment in 
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - [University entrance of dyslexic students in Greece].
PG  - 143-9
AB  - Students with specific developmental learning disorders (dyslexia) may be
      examined orally in university entrance examination providing they have a
      certificate to that effect from a public child psychiatric or psychoeducational
      centre. The aim of this study was to investigate the success rate of dyslexic
      students in the university entrance examinations. Our hypothesis was, firstly,
      that these students will have the same success rate as other students and
      secondly, that they will mainly enter schools of science or technology. Our
      sample consisted of 420 dyslexic students who had sat for university entrance
      exams in 2006. Data was collected anonymously from Ministry of Education's files 
      and consisted of the number of dyslexic students who were examined, their success
      rate, their choice of school and their grade. This data was derived from three
      examination centres in Athens and from five examination centres in an equal
      number of large provincial towns. Results showed that the success rate of
      dyslexic students in university entrance examinations was 39.76%, which was
      statistically lower than that of the general population of candidates which was
      65.36%. Our hypothesis that these students would have a similar university
      entrance rate was not confirmed. Our second hypothesis concerning the preferred
      school of these candidates was confirmed since the majority of dyslexic students 
      chose to study schools of sciences or technology. The dyslexic students' grades
      reveal a similar pattern to those of the general student population in the
      university entrance examinations, as long as these grades are greater than 9 on a
      score from 1-20. However dyslexic students entered technological colleges twice
      as often as the general student population. Our results are representative since 
      our data was collected from 25% of university candidates throughout Greece. The
      anonymous nature of our data does not allow us to draw conclusions concerning
      socio-economic status, IQ levels or the quality and quantity of
      psycho-educational intervention, which would have led us to a more detailed
      analysis of the parameters leading to success or failure. Further investigation
      of the academic progress of dyslexic students would give us a more complete view 
      of their educational achievements.

TI  - Procedural learning difficulties: reuniting the developmental disorders?
PG  - 135-41
AB  - During the past 30 years, research into developmental disorders has fragmented,
      emphasizing differences rather than commonalities. We propose that reunification 
      might be achieved by using a "neural-systems" approach. Deficits in dyslexia are 
      attributed to an intact declarative learning system combined with an impaired
      procedural learning system--a network that includes prefrontal language systems
      and basal ganglia, parietal and cerebellar structures. A typology is provided for
      other prevalent learning disabilities; this framework focuses on different
      learning skills in the understanding of learning disabilities and emphasizes the 
      diagnostic significance of "secondary" symptoms. This approach highlights the
      need for development of "neurocognitive" tests to probe the function of
      components of each neural system and improve strategies for explanation,
      diagnosis and support of developmental disorders.

TI  - Developmental disruptions and behavioral impairments in rats following in utero
      RNAi of Dyx1c1.
PG  - 508-14
AB  - Developmental malformations of cortex have been shown to co-occur with language, 
      learning, and other cognitive deficits in humans. Rodent models have repeatedly
      shown that animals with such developmental malformations have deficits related to
      auditory processing and learning. More specifically, freeze-lesion induced
      microgyria as well as molecular layer ectopias have been found to impair rapid
      auditory processing ability in rats and mice. In humans, deficits in rapid
      auditory processing appear to relate to later impairments of language. Recently, 
      genetic variants of four different genes involved in early brain development have
      been proposed to associate with an elevated incidence of developmental dyslexia
      in humans. Three of these, DYX1C1, DCDC2, and KIAA0319, have been shown by in
      utero RNAi to play a role in neuronal migration in developing neocortex. The
      present study assessed the effects of in utero RNAi of Dyx1c1 on auditory
      processing and spatial learning in rats. Results indicate that RNAi of Dyx1c1 is 
      associated with cortical heterotopia and is suggestive of an overall processing
      deficit of complex auditory stimuli in both juvenile and adult periods (p=.051,
      one-tail). In contrast, adult data alone reveal a significant processing
      impairment among RNAi treated subjects compared to shams, indicating an inability
      for RNAi treated subjects to improve detection of complex auditory stimuli over
      time (p=.022, one-tail). Further, a subset of RNAi treated rats exhibited
      hippocampal heterotopia centered in CA1 (in addition to cortical malformations). 
      Malformations of hippocampus were associated with robust spatial learning
      impairment in this sub-group (p<.01, two-tail). In conclusion, in utero RNAi of
      Dyx1c1 results in heterogeneous malformations that correspond to distinct
      behavioral impairments in auditory processing, and spatial learning.

TI  - Imbalanced word-reading profiles in eighth-graders.
PG  - 169-96
AB  - This current study introduced a new method to investigate the prevalence and
      correlates of significant imbalances in the relative accuracy with which
      eighth-graders read nonwords (e.g., prauma) and exception words (e.g., vaccine). 
      Substantial proportions of students showed imbalanced word-reading profiles, but 
      these were not strongly tied to differences in reading and spelling achievement. 
      Of the students without reading difficulties, 19% had imbalanced word-reading
      profiles favoring exception words and 17% had imbalanced word-reading profiles
      favoring nonwords. Of the poor readers, 39% met the criterion for phonological
      dyslexia (with imbalanced word-reading profiles favoring exception words) and 14%
      met the criterion for surface dyslexia (with imbalanced word-reading profiles
      favoring nonwords) in relation to the eighth-grade benchmark readers, but the
      incidence of these types of dyslexia varied with verbal ability. Of the poor
      readers with normal verbal ability, 60% were classified as phonological dyslexics
      and none was classified as surface dyslexic. In students low in verbal ability,
      surface dyslexia was more common. However, when imbalanced word-reading profiles 
      were defined in relation to fourth-grade reading-level controls, only 12
      phonological dyslexics and 1 surface dyslexic were identified. Relatively few
      cases of either type of developmental dyslexia appeared to be "pure."

TI  - M-stream deficits and reading-related visual processes in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 346-66
AB  - Some visual processing deficits in developmental dyslexia have been attributed to
      abnormalities in the subcortical M stream and/or the cortical dorsal stream of
      the visual pathways. The nature of the relationship between these visual deficits
      and reading is unknown. The purpose of the present article was to characterize
      reading-related perceptual processes that may link the visual deficits to reading
      problems. We identified contrast sensitivity, position encoding, oculomotor
      control, visual attention, parafoveal/foveal interactions, and saccadic
      suppression as potential reading-related dorsal stream processes. We then
      evaluated the role of each process in reading and the status of each process in
      dyslexia. In theory, a number of dorsal stream processes (e.g., oculomotor
      control and visual attention) might contribute to reading problems in
      developmental dyslexia. More work is needed to demonstrate the connection
      empirically.

TI  - [Survey of fMRI results regarding a phonological deficit in children and adults
      with dyslexia: fundamental deficit or indication of compensation?].
PG  - 107-15; quiz 116-7
AB  - Early neuroimaging studies exploring the neurobiological correlates of the
      phonological deficit in dyslexia were restricted to adult probands with dyslexia 
      due to the exposure to radioactivity in the course of PET measurements. The
      differences in activation between normal adult readers and adults with dyslexia
      recorded in these studies left open the issue of whether or not these are indeed 
      fundamental activation deficits or only a reflection of lifelong experience with 
      poor reading and writing skills and thus should be interpreted as a sign of
      compensation. Development of fMRI in recent years has enabled the investigation
      of children with dyslexia in order to explore the neurobiological activation
      patterns that underlie dyslexia. On the whole, the imaging findings in children
      and adults with dyslexia indicate that the left-hemisphere inferior frontal
      differences in activation, as well as the dorsal and ventral temporal differences
      in activation observed in all age groups during the processing of phonological
      language tasks are to be regarded as a fundamental biological deficit in
      dyslexia. Right-hemisphere differences in activation, which in German-speaking
      areas are observable in adults but only rarely in children with dyslexia, might, 
      on the other hand, be regarded as a sign of developmental compensation.

TI  - Dyslexia at a behavioural and a cognitive level.
PG  - 25-41
AB  - The aim of this study was to see whether patterns of neuro-cognitive assets and
      deficits seen in dyslexia also would lead to different patterns of reading and
      writing. A group of dyslexic children was subgrouped by language comprehension
      and mathematics skills in accordance with the definition of the British Dyslexia 
      Association of 1998. This yielded three subgroups that showed three distinct
      neurocognitive profiles depicted within the Multi-Component Model of Working
      Memory. The participants were tested with single word reading and spelling tasks.
      The scores varied only to a minor degree between the subgroups. The results were 
      discussed in view of developmental phases into literacy. Only one subgroup could 
      be defined within the orthographic phase, while the other two were within the
      alphabetic phase. Thus, patterns at the neuro-cognitive level seen in the
      subgroups were to a limited degree reflected at the behavioural level. The
      results were also discussed in view of different orthographies. Since using
      information from phonological testing only, as currently appears to be common
      practice in many contexts, may result in intervention with little effect for some
      dyslexics, it was concluded that assessing neuro-cognitive assets and deficits
      targeting dyslexia is essential to intervention and the understanding of
      dyslexia.

TI  - Cognitive profiles of adult developmental dyslexics: theoretical implications.
PG  - 1-24
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish cognitive profiles of dyslexic adults on
      tests developed within the three main theories of developmental dyslexia:
      phonological, visual magnocellular and cerebellar and to investigate which theory
      can account for these profiles. The sample consisted of 15 Polish university
      students or alumni with a formal diagnosis of dyslexia, without ADHD and 15
      controls matched on education, age, gender, IQ and handedness. The results
      revealed a striking heterogeneity of profiles. Nine dyslexics exhibited only a
      phonological deficit; one a phonological and a visual magnocellular deficit; a
      further three a phonological and a cerebellar deficit; two either a cerebellar or
      a visual magnocellular deficit. None of the three main theories of dyslexia can
      account for all the cases studied here. It is suggested that the best account of 
      these data is in terms of different sub-types of dyslexia with different
      underlying causes, such as phonological, visual magnocellular and cerebellar, or 
      a combination of these. However, an account in terms of Ramus' (Trends, Neurosci.
      2004; 27(12): 720-726) model, according to which the phonological deficit is a
      core deficit in dyslexia and other deficits (magnocellular and cerebellar), are
      just co-morbid markers without a causal relationship to dyslexics' literacy
      difficulties, cannot currently be ruled out.

TI  - Orthographic facilitation and phonological inhibition in spoken word recognition:
      a developmental study.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - We investigated the extent to which learning to read and write affects spoken
      word recognition. Previous studies have reported orthographic effects on spoken
      language in skilled readers. However, very few studies have addressed the
      development of these effects as a function of reading expertise. We therefore
      studied orthographic neighborhood (ON) and phonological neighborhood (PN) effects
      in spoken word recognition in beginning and advanced readers and in children with
      developmental dyslexia. We predicted that whereas both beginning and advanced
      readers would show normal PN effects, only advanced readers would show ON
      effects. The results confirmed these predictions. The size of the ON effect on
      spoken word recognition was strongly predicted by written language experience and
      proficiency. In contrast, the size of the PN effect was not affected by reading
      level. Moreover, dyslexic readers showed no orthographic effects on spoken word
      recognition. In sum, these data suggest that orthographic effects on spoken word 
      recognition are not artifacts of some uncontrolled spoken language property but
      reflect a genuine influence of orthographic information on spoken word
      recognition.

PG  - 173-80
AB  - AIM: To examine the advances made in the fields of cognitive psychology,
      neuroscience and education and how they have contributed to each other.
      DEVELOPMENT: The paper offers a review of the current models of dyslexia and
      analyses the relation between these models and neuroimaging studies and
      educational intervention. The first model presented here is the 'phonological
      deficit' model, which is the most widely proven and accepted today. People with
      dyslexia have difficulty in completing tasks that involve segmenting language at 
      a phonological level. Neuroimaging studies also reveal the existence of atypical 
      brain activation in dyslexics while performing tasks that require phonological
      processing. Intervention programmes of a phonological nature have proved to be
      effective on both a behavioural and a neurophysiological level. Given the
      complexity of the reading process, further research is currently looking into
      other models. Although the 'temporal processing' deficit model is more
      controversial and not as widely accepted as the previous model, some reports
      provide both behavioural and neurophysiological evidence for the existence of
      differences in the visual and auditory processing of dyslexic and control
      subjects. Different educational approaches to put this temporal processing
      deficit to rights have been tested in dyslexic children with successful outcomes.
      Finally, the present status between neuroscience and education in the area of
      reading disorders is examined and future implications concerning the different
      approaches and methods used in current research are analysed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although we are still a long way from understanding the causes of reading
      deficiencies, collaboration between neuroscience, psychology and education does
      help further our understanding of the psychology of reading, its diagnosis and
      its intervention.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to summarize the literacy outcomes for children
      with specific language impairment and to consider principles and approaches for
      literacy intervention with preschool and early school-age children with language 
      impairments. Initially, specific language impairment is defined and
      differentiated from nonspecific language impairment. In addressing intervention
      considerations, we first consider the application of best practice principles and
      then specifically focus on intervention with preschool children and intervention 
      with early school-age children. Consideration of evidence-based treatment
      approaches is guided by the developmental literature and by the intervention
      literature.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to show to what extent developmental 
      dyslexia influences a scope of stereoscopic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 176 pupils and
      students with developmental dyslexia were examined, including 52 girls and 124
      boys aged between 8 and 19. Subjects were divided into three groups in respect of
      their age: I group 8-10 years, II group 10-14 years, III group 15-19 years of
      age, and in respect of a type of dyslexia into: visual and spatial type (W),
      language and auditory (S) and mixed (M). Long distance visual acuity in both eyes
      was 1.0 and near sight visual was 0.5 according to Snellen charts after
      correction of refraction error. Error of refraction ranged from +/- 0.5 Dsph to
      -2.25 Dsph and +3.0 Dsph, while astigmatism ranged from +/- 0.5 Dcyl to -2.0
      Dcyl, +2.25 Dcyl. All the subjects had binocular vision in free space and on
      synoptophore (simultaneous perception, fusion, stereopsis). Reference group
      consisted of children and school children without ophthalmological pathological
      state. While analysing the obtained results it was found that the pupils and
      students with developmental dyslexia of group I and II and of dyslectic
      pathogenic groups (W, S, M) reached statistically considerably higher values of
      stereoscopic vision angle compared with analogous the control group. No
      significant differences were found between the age groups of pupils and students 
      with dyslexia and dyslectic pathogenic groups and the control group within the
      scope of stereoscopic vision acuity and perception of Titmus test stereopsis
      threshold value of 40 arc sec. RESULTS: In dyslectic pathogenic groups (W, S, M) 
      compared with the control group, the perception of Titmus test threshold value of
      40 arc sec was observed significantly and statistically, less frequent.
      CONCLUSIONS: In all pupils and students with developmental dyslexia value of
      stereopsis angle was statistically considerably higher, while the frequency of
      stereopsis threshold value perception for Titmus test was observed statistically 
      considerably less often compared with values obtained in control group.

PG  - 61-77
AB  - In a number of studies, children diagnosed with developmental dyslexia reached
      normal scores in standard visual processing tasks, and some researchers concluded
      that visual processing deficits are not involved in the syndrome. The tasks used,
      however, may be insensitive to anomalous visual information processing strategies
      used to compensate for an underlying deficit. To determine whether children with 
      dyslexia use anomalous visual processing strategies, a same-different task was
      applied, in which 2 items identical under rotation and reflection were judged as 
      same. Pairs of letters or dot patterns were used, which were either symmetric or 
      asymmetric in shape. Children with dyslexia performed faster than normal-reading 
      children--in particular, remarkably, with letters. Symmetry of dot patterns
      facilitated performance in both children with dyslexia and normal-reading
      children; symmetry of letters facilitated performance in children with dyslexia
      but not in normal-reading children. Children with dyslexia, therefore, fail to
      adequately differentiate visual processing of linguistic and non-linguistic
      materials; they process symmetry in letters similarly to that in shapes, which
      leads in this particular task to the paradoxical observation of children with
      dyslexia outperforming normal readers with letters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the cerebellum has been considered to control
      coordinated movement. However, in recent years it has been argued that it
      contributes to higher cognitive functions. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to
      present recent evidence concerning the role of the cerebellum and discusses how
      it can contribute to reading. METHOD: The procedure used involves findings coming
      from three quite different areas, lesion, anatomic and functional imaging
      studies. RESULTS: These studies indicate a link between cerebellum and reading
      and its relationship with specific reading difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Our review 
      provides evidence which is in accordance with the recently established role of
      the cerebellum as a regulator of mental functions and supports theoretical models
      suggesting that cerebellar deficits might be a cause of developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Subtyping of children with developmental dyslexia via bootstrap aggregated
      clustering and the gap statistic: comparison with the double-deficit hypothesis.
PG  - 77-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: The marked degree of heterogeneity in persons with developmental
      dyslexia has motivated the investigation of possible subtypes. Attempts have
      proceeded both from theoretical models of reading and the application of
      unsupervised learning (clustering) methods. Previous cluster analyses of data
      obtained from persons with reading disabilities have suffered from the inherent
      limitations of unsupervised learning methods. Specifically, the reliability and
      stability of cluster solutions have proven difficult to determine. Recent
      developments in the clustering literature have addressed these concerns by
      permitting checks on the internal validity of the solution. Resampling methods
      produce consistent groupings of the data independent of initialization effects,
      while the gap statistic provides a confidence measure for the determination of
      the optimal number of clusters present in the data. Combining these methods
      produces a robust data-driven classification that can be compared with
      theoretically based subtypes to produce better-informed models of developmental
      dyslexia. AIMS: The present study is a novel application of resampling (bootstrap
      aggregating or bagging) methods and the gap statistic to the subtyping of
      children with developmental dyslexia. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to
      illustrate the use of bagging methods and the gap statistic in multivariate data 
      obtained from children with developmental dyslexia; and (2) to compare the bagged
      clustering thresholded by the gap statistic against the predictions of the
      double-deficit hypothesis. The double-deficit hypothesis is a prominent
      theoretical model of developmental dyslexia, which predicts three subtypes:
      phonological, rate, and phonological-rate impaired readers. METHODS & PROCEDURES:
      Three simulated data sets with known cluster structure were created to check the 
      validity and illustrate the utility of the bagged clustering with the gap
      statistic in data with known structure. Subsequently, a clinical database of
      standardized test data (eight tests) from 93 children with developmental dyslexia
      was clustered using these methods. This procedure was repeated on a database of
      93 children without reading disability matched for gender and age as a control.
      Finally, the clustering was repeated on the entire database of 186 participants. 
      Cluster solutions were obtained for an increasing number of clusters (1-10) and
      were tested against the null hypothesis that no subtypes were present, i.e. the
      data represented a single cluster. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Four clusters were
      identified in the children with developmental dyslexia. There was no evidence of 
      significant cluster structure in the children without dyslexia. Two clusters were
      identified when children with and without reading impairments were considered
      together. Among the participants with developmental dyslexia, there was evidence 
      of a phonological-deficit cluster, a rapid-naming cluster, and a cluster showing 
      both depressed phonological processing and rapid naming. These accounted for 73
      of the 93 participants (78%). All three are predicted by the double-deficit
      hypothesis. The fourth cluster consisted of children with normal phonological and
      rapid naming ability incommensurate with their high verbal ability. An analysis
      of variance with post-hoc multiple comparisons demonstrated that the
      phonological, rapid-naming, and double deficit clusters did not differ
      significantly in age, but the fourth cluster was comprised of significantly older
      children. The mixed data set revealed two clusters. One cluster consisted almost 
      entirely of the double-deficit and phonological subtypes. The other consisted of 
      the participants without dyslexia and the children with dyslexia demonstrating
      either a single rapid naming deficit or standardized test scores in the normal
      range. A silhouette analysis indicated that the four-cluster solution for the
      children with developmental dyslexia was superior to the two-cluster solution
      obtained for the entire data set. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides support for the
      presence of distinct subtypes in children with developmental dyslexia and for the
      double-deficit hypothesis. Specifically, this study finds three subtypes
      predicted by the double-deficit hypothesis without the assumption of an a priori 
      theoretical model of reading. Taken together, these subtypes account for 79% of
      the participants with dyslexia. Further, the percentages of children in each
      subtype are in good agreement with previous studies. The participants in the
      subtype not predicted by the double-deficit hypothesis were significantly older
      than the other three groups. Recent advances in unsupervised learning can be
      expected to aid the improvement and refinement of the definition of developmental
      dyslexia. If reliable and consistent subtypes can be identified among persons
      with developmental dyslexia, it is reasonable to assume that diagnostic and
      intervention efforts will be greatly improved.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: an update.
PG  - 104-9
AB  - Dyslexia is the most common and carefully studied of the learning disabilities in
      school-age children. It is characterized by a marked impairment in the
      development of reading skills, and affects a large number of people (5-10%).
      Reading difficulties may also arise from poor vision, emotional problems,
      decreased hearing ability, and behavioral disorders, such as attention-deficit
      hyperactivity (ADHD). Although many areas of the brain are involved in reading,
      analysis of postmortem brain specimens by a variety of imaging techniques most
      consistently suggests that deficiency within a specific component of the language
      system - the phonologic module - in the temporo-parietal-occipital brain region
      underlies dyslexia. It is a highly familial and heritable disorder with
      susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 15 and 18. Recently, four 
      candidate genes (KIAA 0319, DYX1C1, DCDC2 and ROBO1) are shown to be associated
      with dyslexia. Although some of these results are controversial because of the
      genetic heterogeneity of the disorder, the available evidence suggests that
      dyslexia could be due to the abnormal migration and maturation of neurons during 
      early development. Interestingly, in spite of genetic heterogeneity, the
      pathology appears to involve common phonological coding deficits. The condition
      can be managed by a highly structured educational training exercise.

TI  - Working memory functioning in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 34-56
AB  - Working memory impairments in dyslexia are well documented. However, research has
      mostly been limited to the phonological domain, a modality in which people with
      dyslexia have a range of problems. In this paper, 22 adult students with dyslexia
      and 22 age- and IQ-matched controls were presented with both verbal and
      visuospatial working memory tasks. Performance was compared on measures of simple
      span, complex span (requiring both storage and processing), and dynamic memory
      updating in the two domains. The dyslexic group had significantly lower spans
      than the controls on all the verbal tasks, both simple and complex, and also on
      the spatial complex span measure. Impairments remained on the complex span
      measures after controlling statistically for simple span performance, suggesting 
      a central executive impairment in dyslexia. The novelty of task demands on the
      initial trials of the spatial updating task also proved more problematic for the 
      dyslexic than control participants. The results are interpreted in terms of
      extant theories of dyslexia. The possibility of a supervisory attentional system 
      deficit in dyslexia is also raised. It seems clear that working memory
      difficulties in dyslexia extend into adulthood, can affect performance in both
      the phonological and visuospatial modalities, and implicate central executive
      dysfunction, in addition to problems with storage.

TI  - Mental rotation of letters and shapes in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 617-31
AB  - Extending the work of Corballis et al (1985, Cortex 21 225-236), we investigated 
      mental rotation of letters (experiment 1), and of letters and shapes (experiment 
      2) in normal readers and developmental dyslexics. Whereas the overall response
      times were equal for shapes in both groups, for letters they were slower in
      dyslexics. For letters as well as for shapes, however, the same mental-rotation
      effects were obtained between the groups. The results are interpreted as support 
      for the notion of developmental dyslexia as a deficit in functional coordination 
      between graphemic and phonological letter representations.

PG  - 324-32
AB  - This study reports longitudinal follow-up of 300 children with developmental
      dysphasia. Their expressive disturbances are a manifestation of their auditory
      decoding impairment. These children were investigated on battery of tests of
      spoken language, of phonological processing and of different audiometric
      procedures, in order to register all the information necessary to be able judge
      the speech-language development. The tests focused on diagnosis of central
      auditory disorder, confirmed the difficulties in association area in children
      with developmental dysphasia. In speech perception, the temporal processing is
      one of the functions necessary for the discrimination of phonemes, and of similar
      words. Our results confirmed long-term problems of children with developmental
      dysphasia with central auditory perception disorder.

TI  - Computer-based multisensory learning in children with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 355-69
AB  - PURPOSE: Several attempts have been made to remediate developmental dyslexia
      using various training environments. Based on the well-known retrieval structure 
      model, the memory strength of phonemes and graphemes should be strengthened by
      visual and auditory associations between graphemes and phonemes. Using
      specifically designed training software, we examined whether establishing a
      multitude of visuo-auditory associations might help to mitigate writing errors in
      children with developmental dyslexia. METHODS: Forty-three children with
      developmental dyslexia and 37 carefully matched normal reading children performed
      a computer-based writing training (15-20 minutes 4 days a week) for three months 
      with the aim to recode a sequential textual input string into a multi-sensory
      representation comprising visual and auditory codes (including musical tones).
      The study included four matched groups: a group of children with developmental
      dyslexia (n=20) and a control group (n=18) practiced with the training software
      in the first period (3 months, 15-20 minutes 4 days a week), while a second group
      of children with developmental dyslexia (n=23) (waiting group) and a second
      control group (n=19) received no training during the first period. In the second 
      period the children with developmental dyslexia and controls who did not receive 
      training during the first period now took part in the training. RESULTS: Children
      with developmental dyslexia who did not perform computer-based training during
      the first period hardly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of
      0-9%), the dyslexic children receiving training strongly improved their writing
      skills (post-pre improvement of 19-35%). The group who did the training during
      the second period also revealed improvement of writing skills (post-pre
      improvement of 27-35%). Interestingly, we noticed a strong transfer from trained 
      to non-trained words in that the children who underwent the training were also
      better able to write words correctly that were not part of the training software.
      In addition, even non-impaired readers and writers (controls) benefited from this
      training. CONCLUSION: Three-month of visual-auditory multimedia training strongly
      improved writing skills in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic 
      children. Thus, according to the retrieval structure model, multi-sensory
      training using visual and auditory cues enhances writing performance in children 
      with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children.

TI  - Neural correlates of rapid auditory processing are disrupted in children with
      developmental dyslexia and ameliorated with training: an fMRI study.
PG  - 295-310
AB  - PURPOSE: Developmental dyslexia, characterized by unexpected difficulty in
      reading, may involve a fundamental deficit in processing rapid acoustic stimuli. 
      Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we previously reported that
      adults with developmental dyslexia have a disruption in neural response to rapid 
      acoustic stimuli in left prefrontal cortex. Here we examined the neural
      correlates of rapid auditory processing in children. METHODS: Whole-brain fMRI
      was performed on twenty-two children with developmental dyslexia and twenty-three
      typical-reading children while they listened to nonlinguistic acoustic stimuli,
      with either rapid or slow transitions, designed to mimic the spectro-temporal
      structure of consonant-vowel-consonant speech syllables. RESULTS: Typical-reading
      children showed activation for rapid compared to slow transitions in left
      prefrontal cortex. Children with developmental dyslexia did not show any
      differential response in these regions to rapid versus slow transitions. After
      eight weeks of remediation focused primarily on rapid auditory processing,
      phonological and linguistic training the children with developmental dyslexia
      showed significant improvements in language and reading skills, and exhibited
      activation for rapid relative to slow transitions in left prefrontal cortex.
      CONCLUSION: The presence of a disruption in the neural response to rapid stimuli 
      in children with developmental dyslexia prior to remediation, coupled with
      significant improvement in language and reading scores and increased brain
      activation after remediation, gives further support to the importance of rapid
      auditory processing in reading development and disorders.

TI  - Evaluation of children with reading difficulties.
PG  - 2079-84
AB  - Reading difficulties are common and are associated with poor long-term academic
      achievement. Evaluation of a child's developmental, educational, and family
      histories in conjunction with standardized screening tests (e.g., Ages and Stages
      Questionnaires, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status, Safety Word
      Inventory and Literacy Screener) can increase recognition of risk factors for
      reading difficulties. Validated, office-based, standardized screening tests and
      school-administered standardized achievement tests (e.g., California Achievement 
      Tests, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Stanford
      Achievement Test) can be used to assess school-age children with reading
      difficulties. Reading difficulties in children often are caused by environmental 
      and organic risk factors. However, many children have reading or learning
      disabilities and will have lifelong difficulties with reading despite adequate
      intervention. Children with substantial reading difficulties should receive a
      full educational assessment. There is good evidence that individualized
      instruction emphasizing increased phonologic awareness can have a favorable
      long-term effect on academic achievement.

TI  - Language lateralization in phonological, semantic and orthographic tasks: a slow 
      evoked potential study.
PG  - 296-304
AB  - Most of literature on language has shown how different word-classes activate
      distinct neural networks within linguistic cortical areas. The present
      investigation aimed to demonstrate that, by means of slow evoked potentials and
      using the same set of words in different tasks, it is possible to activate
      cortical networks that are spatially and temporally distinguished. Twenty healthy
      subjects had to evaluate, in a word pair matching session, whether two words
      rhymed (phonological task), were semantically related (semantic task) or were
      written in the same letter case (orthographic task). Slow wave amplitude was
      computed in three relevant time windows: the last 0.5 s of first word
      presentation (W1), the initial contingent negative variation (iCNV) and the
      terminal CNV (tCNV). During W1 and iCNV intervals, both the orthographic and the 
      phonological tasks were left lateralized. Furthermore, the phonological task was 
      more lateralized than the orthographic because of a greater inhibition of the
      right hemisphere, whereas the orthographic task was characterized by a greater
      bilateral posterior activation. During the tCNV, only the phonological task
      remained left lateralized while orthographic and semantic were bilaterally
      distributed. Although the use of the same set of words tends to activate widely
      overlapped networks, in the present research task manipulation was effective in
      demonstrating task dependent differences in brain lateralization. Thus, the
      present paradigm and the adopted tasks are especially suited for studying deficit
      and recovery of language in patients affected by linguistic disorders such as
      developmental dyslexia and aphasia.

TI  - Development of perceptual correlates of reading performance.
PG  - 126-41
AB  - Performance on perceptual tasks requiring the discrimination of brief, temporally
      proximate or temporally varying sensory stimuli (temporal processing tasks) is
      impaired in some individuals with developmental language disorder and/or
      dyslexia. Little is known about how these temporal processes in perception
      develop and how they relate to language and reading performance in the normal
      population. The present study examined performance on 8 temporal processing tasks
      and 5 language/reading tasks in 120 unselected readers who varied in age over a
      range in which reading and phonological awareness were developing. Performance on
      all temporal processing tasks except coherent motion detection improved over ages
      7 years to adulthood (p<0.01), especially between ages 7 and 13 years.
      Independent of these age effects, performance on all 8 temporal processing tasks 
      predicted phonological awareness and reading performance (p<0.05), and three
      auditory temporal processing tasks predicted receptive language function
      (p<0.05). Furthermore, all temporal processing measures except within-channel gap
      detection and coherent motion detection predicted unique variance in phonological
      scores within subjects, whereas only within-channel gap detection performance
      explained unique variance in orthographic reading performance. These findings
      partially support the (Farmer, M.E., Klein, R.M., 1995. The evidence for a
      temporal processing deficit linked to dyslexia: A review. Psychon. Bull. Rev. 2, 
      460-493) notion of there being separable auditory and visual perceptual
      contributions to phonological and orthographic reading development. The data also
      are compatible with the view that the umbrella term "temporal processing"
      encompasses fundamentally different sensory or cognitive processes that may
      contribute differentially to language and reading performance, which may have
      different developmental trajectories and be differentially susceptible to
      pathology.

TI  - Spelling transparency and its impact on dyslexic and unimpaired children's memory
      for words.
PG  - 319-34
AB  - The phonologically transparent Persian orthography is normally transcribed with
      two distinct spellings; words spelled with vowels (letters) transcribed as a
      fixed part of the spelling (transparent) and words spelled with vowels
      (diacritics) omitted (opaque). Three groups of Persian readers, namely
      developmental dyslexics (n=29, mean age=9.4, SD=1.4), unimpaired readers matched 
      on age (n=49, mean age=9, SD=1.3), and reading age (n=23, mean age=7.2, SD=0.4)
      with the dyslexics performed on a short-term memory verbal test. The time taken
      to read aloud lists of words with opaque and transparent spellings, the errors
      made on reading the words in each list, and the number of correctly recalled
      words in each list was subjected to statistical analysis. The results showed that
      transparent words as a whole were read more accurately than opaque words.
      However, recall of words was best for opaque words for the older group of
      unimpaired readers compared to the transparent words, while the opposite was true
      for dyslexics and unimpaired reading age matched participants. The implications
      of these results are discussed.

TI  - Individual differences in anatomy predict reading and oral language impairments
      in children.
PG  - 3329-42
AB  - Developmental dyslexia (DD) and specific language impairment (SLI) are disorders 
      of language that differ in diagnostic criteria and outcome. DD is defined by
      isolated reading deficits. SLI is defined by poor receptive and expressive oral
      language skills. Reading deficits, although prevalent, are not necessary for the 
      diagnosis of SLI. An enduring question is whether these two disorders are
      qualitatively different or simply differ quantitatively along a dimension of
      severity. Here we address this problem by examining neuroanatomical correlates of
      reading and language in children with learning disabilities. We asked whether a
      quantitative anatomical risk index derived from previous work could predict
      behavioural profiles in a heterogeneous sample of 14 boys and 8 girls (11-16
      years of age) with reading and language impairments. The results confirmed our
      predictions that (i) children with relatively smaller and symmetrical brain
      structures (negative risk indices) would have the severe comprehension
      impairments typical of SLI; (ii) children with larger, asymmetrical brain
      structures (positive risk indices) would have poor word reading in the presence
      of relatively preserved comprehension, a profile typical of DD; and (iii) the
      best performance would be seen in children with anatomical risk indices near zero
      (normal anatomy). Also, in confirmation of previous work, rapid automatic naming 
      was not predicted by the anatomical risk index, but by anatomical measures
      derived from the frontal lobes. These results highlight the key significance of
      comprehension deficits in distinguishing DD from SLI. Reading impaired children
      with and without comprehension deficits appear to occupy neuroanatomical domains 
      on the opposite sides of normal.

TI  - Imputation methods to improve inference in SNP association studies.
PG  - 690-702
AB  - Missing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are quite common in genetic
      association studies. Subjects with missing SNPs are often discarded in analyses, 
      which may seriously undermine the inference of SNP-disease association. In this
      article, we develop two haplotype-based imputation approaches and one tree-based 
      imputation approach for association studies. The emphasis is to evaluate the
      impact of imputation on parameter estimation, compared to the standard practice
      of ignoring missing data. Haplotype-based approaches build on haplotype
      reconstruction by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or a weighted EM
      (WEM) algorithm, depending on whether case-control status is taken into account. 
      The tree-based approach uses a Gibbs sampler to iteratively sample from a full
      conditional distribution, which is obtained from the classification and
      regression tree (CART) algorithm. We employ a standard multiple imputation
      procedure to account for the uncertainty of imputation. We apply the methods to
      simulated data as well as a case-control study on developmental dyslexia. Our
      results suggest that imputation generally improves efficiency over the standard
      practice of ignoring missing data. The tree-based approach performs comparably
      well as haplotype-based approaches, but the former has a computational advantage.
      The WEM approach yields the smallest bias at a price of increased variance.

TI  - Further evidence that the KIAA0319 gene confers susceptibility to developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 1085-91, 1061
AB  - The DYX2 locus on chromosome 6p22.2 is the most replicated region of linkage to
      developmental dyslexia (DD). Two candidate genes within this region have recently
      been implicated in the disorder: KIAA0319 and DCDC2. Variants within DCDC2 have
      shown association with DD in a US and a German sample. However, when we genotyped
      these specific variants in two large, independent UK samples, we obtained only
      weak, inconsistent evidence for their involvement in DD. Having previously found 
      evidence that variation in the KIAA0319 gene confers susceptibility to DD, we
      sought to refine this genetic association by genotyping 36 additional SNPs in the
      gene. Nine SNPs, predominantly clustered around the first exon, showed the most
      significant association with DD in one or both UK samples, including rs3212236 in
      the 5' flanking region (P = 0.00003) and rs761100 in intron 1 (P = 0.0004). We
      have thus refined the region of association with developmental dyslexia to
      putative regulatory sequences around the first exon of the KIAA0319 gene,
      supporting the presence of functional mutations that could affect gene
      expression. Our data also suggests a possible interaction between KIAA0319 and
      DCDC2, which requires further testing.

TI  - Implicit learning deficits in dyslexic adults: an fMRI study.
PG  - 1218-26
AB  - It is assumed that several neuropsychological impairments characterize the
      cognitive profile of individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD). Phonological
      and visual processing are often impaired as well as auditory processing,
      attention, and information processing speed. Although reports in the literature
      on implicit learning abilities are contradictory, recent neurological and
      physiological data suggest that these abilities are deficient in individuals with
      DD. To evaluate implicit learning we administered a classical version of the
      serial reaction time task (SRTT) related to sequence learning. Using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging we investigated brain activation patterns associated
      with implicit learning deficits in 14 adults with DD matched with 14 normal
      readers. SRTT results indicated the absence of implicit learning in the DD group 
      and different activations between groups mainly in SMA, inferior parietal areas
      and cerebellar lobule 6. These results can be interpreted in the light of the
      different capacities for the two groups to build an internal model to guide
      movements. Further, they explain DD individuals' difficulty in domains not
      directly related to reading ability.

TI  - DYX1C1 functions in neuronal migration in developing neocortex.
PG  - 515-22
AB  - Rodent homologues of two candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes, Kiaa0319 and
      Dcdc2, have been shown to play roles in neuronal migration in developing cerebral
      neocortex. This functional role is consistent with the hypothesis that dyslexia
      susceptibility is increased by interference with normal neural development. In
      this study we report that in utero RNA interference against the rat homolog of
      another candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, DYX1C1, disrupts neuronal
      migration in developing neocortex. The disruption of migration can be rescued by 
      concurrent overexpression of DYX1C1, indicating that the impairment is not due to
      off-target effects. Transfection of C- and N-terminal truncations of DYX1C1 shows
      that the C-terminal TPR domains determine DYX1C1 intracellular localization to
      cytoplasm and nucleus. RNAi rescue experiments using truncated versions of DYX1C1
      further indicate that the C-terminus of DYX1C1 is necessary and sufficient to
      DYX1C1's function in migration. In conclusion, DYX1C1, similar to two other
      candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes, functions in neuronal migration in rat
      neocortex.

TI  - Auditory event-related potentials differ in dyslexics even when auditory
      psychophysical performance is normal.
PG  - 190-9
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by a phonological processing deficit and 
      impaired low-level auditory processing may contribute to this problem. However,
      this remains controversial because not all dyslexic individuals show
      psychophysical deficits on auditory processing tasks; hence it has been argued
      that auditory processing deficits are not a causal factor in dyslexia. Because
      behavioral psychophysical tasks include both bottom-up processing and top-down
      strategies, dyslexics' successful coping strategies may positively influence
      their performance on auditory behavioral measures. Therefore we have studied
      whether dyslexics who perform adequately on auditory psychophysical tasks
      nevertheless show electrophysiological evidence of impaired auditory processing. 
      We compared auditory event-related mismatch negativity (MMN) potentials to
      frequency modulated (FM) tones at 5, 20 and 240 Hz between dyslexic adults and
      controls. Groups were matched for age, cognitive ability and psychophysical FM
      detection thresholds. The dyslexic group showed significantly smaller MMNs in the
      20 Hz FM condition in both the early (150-300 ms, P=0.010) and late (300-500 ms, 
      P=0.049) time frames. A 2-way ANOVA showed a significant group by FM rate
      interaction (P=0.012). There were no significant differences between the groups
      in the 5 Hz or 240 Hz conditions. The magnitude of the 20 Hz FM MMN correlated
      with the degree of discrepancy between cognitive and literacy skills (0.66,
      P=0.003) in the entire group. Thus, even among compensated dyslexics with
      above-average cognitive abilities and adequate performance on auditory
      psychophysical tasks, the MMN responses of some dyslexic adults were found to be 
      abnormal.

AB  - We report the case of a young girl who presented severe learning disabilities in 
      oral and written language related to a continuous spike-waves during slow sleep
      (CSWS) syndrome. A sleep EEG recording obtained in her younger brother, who
      presented a clinical pattern suggesting developmental dysphasia, also showed a

TI  - Normal neuropsychological development in children with congenital complete heart 
      block who may or may not be exposed to high-dose dexamethasone in utero.
PG  - 1422-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal and postnatal treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) may
      negatively affect the neuropsychological development in children. Maternal
      anti-Ro/Sjogren's syndrome A (SSA) antibodies may also be associated with
      learning disabilities in offspring. OBJECTIVE: To assess neuropsychological
      development in babies exposed to very high dosages of DEX in utero, whose mothers
      were anti-Ro/SSA positive. METHODS: 13 children with congenital complete heart
      block (CHB) (11 exposed and 2 not exposed to DEX) and 3 healthy siblings, all of 
      anti-Ro/SSA-positive women, were evaluated. 11 preschool-aged children (5 boys)
      were assessed using Griffiths Mental Development Scales. 5 school-aged children
      (2 boys) were examined using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to 
      check IQ and reading tests to explore the existence of learning disabilities or
      dyslexia. None of the children had had major neonatal complications, although
      those with CHB had to be paced at different intervals from birth. RESULTS: The
      children had been exposed in utero to a mean total dose of 186.6 mg DEX. IQ
      levels were always normal (mean IQ 105.1, standard deviation (SD) 9.5). Only one 
      child had a learning disability, of borderline clinical significance, but this
      child had never been exposed to DEX. CONCLUSION: No negative effects were found
      on the neuropsychological development in this cohort of children, even if they
      had been exposed to maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and to very high dosages of
      DEX (much higher than those used to improve fetal lung maturity). These findings 
      might be of interest in view of the large number of infants exposed in the past
      to repeated antenatal courses of steroids.

TI  - Brain morphology and neuropsychological profiles in a family displaying dyslexia 
      and superior nonverbal intelligence.
PG  - 1107-18
AB  - Behavioral research suggests that individuals with dyslexia may have exceptional 
      skills in nonverbal cognitive processes, while genetic studies have noted that
      giftedness, high IQ and/or special talents tend to run in families. Taken
      together, these results suggest that persons within families (particularly
      offspring) may share similar cortical systems supporting those functions.
      Postmortem and in vivo imaging studies have linked dyslexia to abnormalities in
      the structures associated with the parietal operculum (PO) (e.g., planum
      temporale, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus). In this paper we present data
      on a single family showing a link between dyslexia, superior nonverbal IQ and
      atypical PO presentation. We consider the psychometric and neurological patterns 
      of this family as a tentative etiological test of the putative dyslexia-talent
      association.

TI  - Predicting delayed letter knowledge development and its relation to grade 1
      reading achievement among children with and without familial risk for dyslexia.
PG  - 1128-42
AB  - The authors examined the developmental trajectories of children's early letter
      knowledge in relation to measures spanning and encompassing their prior
      language-related and cognitive measures and environmental factors and their
      subsequent Grade 1 reading achievement. Letter knowledge was assessed
      longitudinally at ages 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.5 years; earlier language skills and 
      environmental factors were assessed at ages 3.5 and 4.5 years; and reading
      achievement was assessed at the beginning and end of Grade 1. The analyses were
      conducted on a longitudinal data set involving children with and without familial
      risk for dyslexia. Emerging from the trajectory analysis of letter knowledge were
      3 separate clusters: delayed (n = 63), linearly growing (n = 73), and precocious 
      (n = 51). The members of the delayed cluster were predominantly children with
      familial risk for dyslexia, and the members of the precocious cluster were
      predominantly control group children. Phonological sensitivity, phonological
      memory, and rapid naming skills predicted delayed letter knowledge. Environmental
      predictors included level of maternal education and the amount of letter name
      teaching. Familial risk for dyslexia made a significant contribution to the
      predictive relations. Membership in the delayed cluster predicted poor reading
      performance at Grade 1.

TI  - Balancing and pointing tasks in dyslexic and control adults.
PG  - 276-88
AB  - Developmental dyslexia may affect as much as 15% of the population, but the
      aetiology of the disorder is still being debated. The cerebellar theory of
      dyslexia proposes that cerebellar dysfunction could lead to the myriad of
      symptoms seen in dyslexic individuals, both in literacy and non-literacy domains.
      The cerebellum is crucial to the fluent performance of motor skills. Previous
      studies have found that dyslexic children are worse than control children on
      certain motor and balancing tasks. Here the performance of 28 dyslexic compared
      to 26 control adults on rapid pointing and balancing measures, tasks which are
      thought to reflect cerebellar function, was investigated. There were no
      significant differences between the dyslexic and control participants on the
      balancing tasks or when the speed and accuracy of pointing were analysed
      separately. However, when the speed and accuracy of pointing were combined, the
      dyslexic participants showed poorer performance than the controls (p = 0.045).
      Furthermore, there were significant relationships between performance on the
      pointing task and literacy skills, and regression analysis showed that the error 
      and speed of pointing contributed significantly to the variance in literacy
      skill. The implications for the role of the cerebellum and processing speed in
      dyslexia are discussed.

      impairments observed in an earlier study of these children. In comparison to a
      control group of at-risk children who were normal readers at age 10, three of the
      four dyslexic children exhibited either stagnation or a decline in speech
      accuracy in the presence of a vocabulary growth spurt at age 2-3 years. Skills in
      phonological awareness seemed to vary inconsistently with both early speech
      development and emergent literacy across the four cases. Delayed development in
      emergent literacy turned out to be the most potent prognostic indicator of later 
      reading disorders. The study was guided by lexical restructuring theories of
      dyslexia.

TI  - Phonological but not auditory discrimination is impaired in dyslexia.
PG  - 2945-53
AB  - Deficient phonological skills are considered to be a core problem in
      developmental dyslexia. Children with dyslexia often demonstrate poorer
      performance than non-impaired readers when categorizing speech-sounds. Using the 
      automatic mismatch response, we show that in contrast to this deficit at the
      behavioural level, neurophysiological responding in dyslexic children indicates
      their ability to automatically discriminate syllables. Therefore, the
      phonological deficit is unlikely to be caused by a temporal deficit or by a noisy
      functional organization in the respective representational cortex. We obtained
      measures of reading, spelling and categorical speech-perception from 58 dyslexic 
      children and 21 control children. The children also participated in
      magnetoencephalographic measurements while being stimulated acoustically with the
      syllables /ba/ and /da/ in an oddball paradigm. Mismatch field (MMF) amplitudes
      between standard and deviant stimuli were obtained. Dyslexic children performed
      more poorly than control children on all test measures. However, the groups did
      not differ in MMF amplitude or latency. No correlations were found between MMF
      amplitudes and behavioural performance. These results were obtained with a large 
      sample size and thus speak robustly against a general deficit in auditory
      discrimination in dyslexia. These results are compatible with the idea that
      decoding difficulties occur later in the processing stream where access to the
      phonological lexicon is attempted.

TI  - Visual function and execution of microsaccades related to reading skills, in
      cerebral palsied children.
PG  - 1347-58
AB  - This article investigates the ability of cerebral palsied (CP) children to
      execute microsaccades. One-hundred and five congenitally CP school aged children 
      (6 to 15 years old), without severe mental retardation, were classified into
      three groups: those with spastic quadriplegi, spastic diplegics, and spastic
      hemiplegics on the basis of: (1) patient anamnesis, (2) IQ estimation, (3)
      evaluation of the microsaccadic skills with the Developmental Eye Movement test
      (DEM). Their performance in these tests was compared with a control group from
      the general pediatric population. IQ of the CP children ranged between 70 and
      100; the microsaccadic skills were severely affected: only 19% of the CP children
      had normal function, 20.9% of the CP children appeared with a pure oculomotor
      problem, 32.4% of the CP children had a visual-perceptual problem, and 27.7% of
      the CP children had a combined oculomotor and visual perceptual problem. CP
      children, in the absence of severe mental retardation, have disturbed visual
      skills and visual perception that usually leads to reading difficulties. It is
      also suggested that microsaccadic skills of CP children is an identifiable factor
      compounding the adverse effects of mental retardation on reading skills.

TI  - Effects of coexisting disorders on cognition and behavior in children with ADHD.
PG  - 192-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of coexisting disorders affects
      memory, visual-motor skills, and daily functioning in children with ADHD. METHOD:
      Eighty-four boys and 18 girls (8 to 16 years old) participate in this study.
      Twenty children meet criteria for ADHD alone, 42 children for ADHD plus one other
      disorder, and 40 children for ADHD plus at least two other disorders (reading
      disability, developmental coordination disorder, oppositional defiant disorder,
      conduct disorder, anxiety, and depression). Children are assessed on memory and
      visual-motor skills. Parents complete measures of daily functioning. RESULTS: No 
      significant group differences emerge for age, socioeconomic status, or IQ. Poorer
      performance on tests of memory and visual-motor skills, more prevalent behavioral
      problems, and more impairment in everyday functioning are associated with a
      higher number of coexisting disorders in children with ADHD. CONCLUSION: The
      presence of coexisting disorders has a significant influence on cognition and
      behavior of children with ADHD.

TI  - Lobar asymmetries in subtypes of dyslexic and control subjects.
PG  - 922-31
AB  - Reading involves phonologic decoding, in which readers "sound out" a word;
      orthographic decoding, in which readers recognize a word visually, as in "sight
      reading"; and comprehension. Because reading can involve multiple processes,
      dyslexia might be a heterogeneous disorder. This study investigated behavior and 
      gross lobar anatomy in subtypes of dyslexic and control subjects. Subjects aged
      18 to 25 years with identified reading problems and a group of healthy controls
      were given cognitive and behavioral tests and volumetric brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). Because atypical cerebral laterality has been proposed as a
      potential neural risk for dyslexia, dyslexic and control subjects were compared
      on anatomy of gross lobar regions. On asymmetry quotients, no significant
      differences were found between groups. Examination of the percentage of total
      brain volume of each structure revealed that control and dyslexic subjects were
      significantly different (P = .018). Dyslexic subjects had a larger percentage of 
      brain volume than did the controls in the areas of total prefrontal (P = .003;
      9.30% larger) and superior prefrontal (P = .004; 11.48% larger region). A Pearson
      correlation was performed to investigate whether a relationship existed between
      behavioral measures and either volumes of total prefrontal and total occipital
      regions or asymmetry quotients. A significant positive relationship between the
      left total occipital and word identification performance existed (R = .452, P =
      .045). Because it is believed by some that dyslexia occurs in varying degrees of 
      severity, and because one of the research questions in this study is whether
      anatomy relates to severity or to distinct biologic groups, subjects were grouped
      according to both the nature and distinct pattern of reading or language
      performance and the degree of deficit. A battery of reading tests revealed five
      clinical subgroups of control (two) and dyslexic (three) subjects. These
      subgroups were statistically different on all cognitive and behavioral measures. 
      When asymmetry was investigated across subgroups, significant differences between
      subgroups were found at the multivariate level (P = .043). Only the phonologic
      deficit groups (weak phonologic controls, phonologic deficit dyslexic subjects)
      had atypical asymmetry patterns. This finding suggests that lack of subtyping
      could have confounded earlier studies and that anomalous asymmetry might be
      related to phonologic dyslexia, whereas other subtypes might be reflective of
      environmental factors. Examination of volume at the subgroup level also showed
      differences between subgroups that might have implications for the nature of
      compensation. This study supports the concept that anomalous anatomy might
      reflect anomalous functional cerebral laterality, which could be a risk factor
      for developmental dyslexia, varying according to the nature of the deficit.

TI  - Impaired balance in developmental dyslexia? A meta-analysis of the contending
      evidence.
PG  - 1159-66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental dyslexia is typically defined by deficits in
      phonological skills, but it is also associated with anomalous performance on
      measures of balance. Although balance assessments are included in several
      screening batteries for dyslexia, the association between impairments in literacy
      and deficits in postural stability could be due to the high co-occurrence of
      dyslexia with other developmental disorders in which impairments of motor
      behaviour are also prevalent. METHODS: We identified 17 published studies that
      compared balance function between dyslexia and control samples and obtained
      effect-sizes for each. Contrast and association analyses were used to quantify
      the influence of hypothesised moderator variables on differences in effects
      across studies. RESULTS: The mean effect-size of the balance deficit in dyslexia 
      was .64 (95% CI = .44-.78) with heterogeneous findings across the population of
      studies. Probable co-occurrence of other developmental disorders and variability 
      in intelligence scores in the dyslexia samples were the strongest moderator
      variables of effect-size. CONCLUSIONS: Balance deficits are associated with
      dyslexia, but these effects are apparently more strongly related to third
      variables other than to reading ability. Deficits of balance may indicate
      increased risk of developmental disorder, but are unlikely to be uniquely
      associated with dyslexia.

TI  - Suicidality, school dropout, and reading problems among adolescents.
PG  - 507-14
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the risk of suicidal ideation and
      suicide attempts and school dropout among youth with poor reading in comparison
      to youth with typical reading (n = 188) recruited from public schools at the age 
      of 15. In a prospective naturalistic study, youth and parents participated in
      repeated research assessments to obtain information about suicide ideation and
      attempts, psychiatric and sociodemographic variables, and school dropout. Youth
      with poor reading ability were more likely to experience suicidal ideation or
      attempts and more likely to drop out of school than youth with typical reading,
      even after controlling for sociodemographic and psychiatric variables.
      Suicidality and school dropout were strongly associated with each other.
      Prevention efforts should focus on better understanding the relationship between 
      these outcomes, as well as on the developmental paths leading up to these
      behaviors among youth with reading difficulties.

PG  - 431-8
AB  - We investigated modality-specific changes in N400 event related potential using a
      semantic category decision task in 38 control subjects and 8 patients with
      developmental dyslexia. In control children under 10 years old, auditory N400
      showed a negative deflection over the fronto-centro-parietal areas with
      substantial amplitude. Control children over 10 years old showed a similar
      pattern of N400 waves in a visual and an auditory-visual modality, suggesting
      that the visual modality becomes dominant in the late teens. Dyslexic children
      showed more errors on a visual than auditory modality task with poorer N400 waves
      for visual stimuli. However, peak latencies of N400 in an auditory-visual
      modality were almost the same for auditory stimuli in control children.
      Differences in the N400 pattern in children might reflect the fragility and
      reversibility of the semantic processes through stimulus modalities.

PG  - 435-44
AB  - Dyslexia is a very common developmental disorder. The aetiology of this complex
      disorder must in large part still be clarified. Dyslexia segregates in families
      and the risk for a sibling to become dyslexic is 3.5-fold increased. Different
      phenotypic dimensions are correlated with dyslexia. These are mainly phonological
      awareness, phonological decoding, orthographic coding, auditory short-term
      memory, and rapid naming. The correlated dimensions segregate in families and
      were found to be heritable. The heritability of word reading lies between 50% and
      60%, and that of spelling between 50% and 70%. Based on genome wide linkage
      analyses, nine candidate gene regions (DYX1-DYX9) could be identified. Recently, 
      four candidate genes, DCDC2, KIAA0319, ROBO1 and DYX1C1 were identified by
      systematic association analyses. All these genes play a function role in neuronal
      migration, making them promising candidate genes for dyslexia. However, a
      functionally relevant mutation has not yet been identified. The comorbidity
      between dyslexia and ADHD and between dyslexia and SLI could be explained, at
      least in part, by genetic factors. For future research, all relevant factors
      playing a functional role in dyslexia should be investigated in sufficiently
      large samples. This research should integrate genetic, neurobiological, and
      environmental factors. For an understanding of causes, it is very helpful to
      understand the interaction between different factors, namely gene-environmental
      and gene-gene interaction. In a recent project funded by the EU in the Sixth
      Framework (www.neurodys.com), the worldwide largest sample of children with
      dyslexia will be sampled and investigated. The goal of this project is to
      investigate the biological basis of dyslexia in order to improve the basis for
      the development of successful diagnostics and therapies.

      equated for reading ability.
PG  - 10700-8
AB  - Adults and children with developmental dyslexia exhibit reduced parietotemporal
      activation in functional neuroimaging studies of phonological processing. These
      studies used age-matched and/or intelligence quotient-matched control groups
      whose reading ability and scanner task performance were often superior to that of
      the dyslexic group. It is unknown, therefore, whether differences in activation
      reflect simply poorer performance in the scanner, the underlying level of reading
      ability, or more specific neural correlates of dyslexia. To resolve this
      uncertainty, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, with a
      rhyme judgment task, in which we compared dyslexic children with two control
      groups: age-matched children and reading-matched children (younger normal readers
      equated for reading ability or scanner-performance to the dyslexic children).
      Dyslexic children exhibited reduced activation relative to both age-matched and
      reading-matched children in the left parietotemporal cortex and five other
      regions, including the right parietotemporal cortex. The dyslexic children also
      exhibited reduced activation bilaterally in the parietotemporal cortex when
      compared with children equated for task performance during scanning. Nine of the 
      10 dyslexic children exhibited reduced left parietotemporal activation compared
      with their individually selected age-matched or reading-matched control children.
      Additionally, normal reading fifth graders showed more activation in the same
      bilateral parietotemporal regions than normal-reading third graders. These
      findings indicate that the activation differences seen in the dyslexic children
      cannot be accounted for by either current reading level or scanner task
      performance, but instead represent a distinct developmental atypicality in the
      neural systems that support learning to read.

TI  - Speech- and sound-segmentation in dyslexia: evidence for a multiple-level
      cortical impairment.
PG  - 2420-7
AB  - Developmental dyslexia involves deficits in the visual and auditory domains, but 
      is primarily characterized by an inability to translate the written linguistic
      code to the sound structure. Recent research has shown that auditory dysfunctions
      in dyslexia might originate from impairments in early pre-attentive processes,
      which affect behavioral discrimination. Previous studies have shown that whereas 
      dyslexic individuals are deficient in discriminating sound distinctions involving
      consonants or simple pitch changes, discrimination of other sound aspects, such
      as tone duration, is intact. We hypothesized that such contrasts that can be
      discriminated by dyslexic individuals when heard in isolation are difficult to
      identify when occurring within words or structurally similar complex sound
      patterns. In the current study, we addressed how segments of pseudo-words and
      their non-speech counterparts are processed in dyslexia. We assessed the
      detection of long-duration differences in segments of these stimuli and
      identified the brain processes that could be associated with the behavioral
      results. Consistent with previous studies, we found no early cortical
      sound-duration discrimination deficit in dyslexia. However, differences between
      impaired and non-impaired readers were found in the brain processes associated
      with sound-change recognition as well as in the behavioral performance. This
      suggests that even when the early, automatic, sound discrimination processes are 
      intact in dyslexic individuals, deficits in the later, attention-dependent
      processes may lead to impaired perception of speech and other complex sounds.

TI  - Evidence for ocular motor deficits in developmental dyslexia: application of the 
      double-step paradigm.
PG  - 4401-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Dyslexia is a language-based learning disability characterized by
      difficulties with reading, spelling, and writing. Persons with dyslexia often
      have deficits in processing rapid temporal sensory information. There is also
      evidence of sensorimotor deficits in persons with dyslexia. Whether these
      deficits include ocular motor problems is still an open question. Some previous
      studies have shown an increased saccadic latency in dyslexics, whereas others
      have not reproduced this finding. The purpose of the present study was to
      investigate saccadic latency in young adults with dyslexia during the double-step
      paradigm, a task that requires rapid sequential visual information processing and
      saccade generation. The study hypothesis was that dyslexics have a longer
      saccadic latency in the second orthogonal saccade, a task that nondyslexics
      parallel process and perform rapidly. METHODS: Eight students with dyslexia and
      eight age-matched control subjects participated in the study. Their eye movements
      were monitored with the scleral search coil technique in simple saccade trials
      and in the double-step paradigm. The second saccade was either orthogonal or
      colinear to the first. Intersaccadic interval and latency were calculated for the
      second saccade. RESULTS: No difference in saccadic latency was found for colinear
      second saccades; however, dyslexics had significantly longer latencies for
      orthogonal second saccades. This included a subset of subjects who had longer
      latencies for orthogonal than for colinear saccades. CONCLUSIONS: The findings
      indicate that under certain conditions, when the demand for rapid visual
      information processing is high and a rapid saccade sequence is required, some
      persons with dyslexia show ocular motor deficits manifested by longer saccadic
      latencies.

TI  - Structure and function of the superior temporal plane in adult males with cleft
      lip and palate: pathologic enlargement with no relationship to childhood hearing 
      deficits.
PG  - 994-1002
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a previous study from our lab, adult males with non-syndromic
      cleft lip and/or palate (NSCLP) were shown to have significantly lower temporal
      lobe gray matter volume than matched controls. The current study was designed to 
      begin a regional analysis of specific subregions of the temporal lobe. The
      superior temporal plane (STP) is a brain region involved in the governance of
      auditory processing and aspects of language. The cognitive deficit of subjects
      with NSCLP is characterized by specific deficits in language; therefore this
      region of the temporal lobe is particularly important to investigate in this
      population. The STP has been found to be structurally abnormal in subjects with
      dyslexia, another developmental disorder involving language deficit. The
      hypothesis for the current study was that the STP in subjects with NSCLP would be
      structurally abnormal and that the abnormality would be related to cognitive
      deficit, but not to developmental hearing deficit. METHODS: Manual tracing of the
      STP in NSCLP males and matched controls was performed on magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans. Ratios of STP to total temporal lobe gray matter volume were
      calculated and compared across groups. In addition, the morphology of the STP was
      correlated to cognitive function as well as measures of hearing deficit during
      infancy and childhood. RESULTS: Despite overall deficit in temporal lobe gray
      matter, the STP is disproportionately large in subjects with NSCLP compared to
      controls. Further, gray matter volume of the STP was inversely correlated with IQ
      and language test scores in CLP subjects. Hearing loss throughout childhood and
      adulthood was not significantly correlated with brain morphology. CONCLUSIONS:
      The structure of the superior temporal plane in adult males with NSCLP was
      disproportionately large. This abnormally increased volume was directly related
      to IQ, with greater STP volume being associated with lower cognitive functioning,
      thus characterizing the finding as 'pathologic enlargement'. Moreover, there was 
      no relationship between the structure of the STP and measures of childhood
      hearing impairment, supporting the notion that the language deficits of this
      population are more likely due to abnormal brain development than to the effects 
      of hearing deficit during childhood.

TI  - Auditory language comprehension in children with developmental dyslexia: evidence
      from event-related brain potentials.
PG  - 1676-95
AB  - In the present study, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to compare 
      auditory sentence comprehension in 16 children with developmental dyslexia (age
      9-12 years) and unimpaired controls matched on age, sex, and nonverbal
      intelligence. Passive sentences were presented, which were either correct or
      contained a syntactic violation (phrase structure) or a semantic violation
      (selectional restriction). In an overall sentence correctness judgment task, both
      control and dyslexic children performed well. In the ERPs, control children and
      dyslexic children demonstrated a similar N400 component for the semantic
      violation. For the syntactic violation, control children demonstrated a combined 
      pattern, consisting of an early starting bilaterally distributed anterior
      negativity and a late centro-parietal positivity (P600). Dyslexic children showed
      a different pattern that is characterized by a delayed left lateralized anterior 
      negativity, followed by a P600. These data indicate that dyslexic children do not
      differ from unimpaired controls with respect to semantic integration processes
      (N400) or controlled processes of syntactic reanalyses (P600) during auditory
      sentence comprehension. However, early and presumably highly automatic processes 
      of phrase structure building reflected in the anterior negativity are delayed in 
      dyslexic children. Moreover, the differences in hemispheric distribution of the
      syntactic negativity indicate different underlying processes in dyslexic children
      and controls. The bilateral distribution in controls suggests an involvement of
      right hemispherically established prosodic processes in addition to the left
      hemispherically localized syntactic processes, supporting the view that prosodic 
      information may be used to facilitate syntactic processing during normal
      comprehension. The left hemispheric distribution observed for dyslexic children, 
      in contrast, suggests that these children do not rely on information about the
      prosodic contour during auditory sentence comprehension as much as controls do.
      This finding points toward a phonological impairment in dyslexic children that
      might hamper the development of syntactic processes.

TI  - [Critical analysis of children with suspicion of auditory processing disorders].
PG  - 738-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: APDs at infancy has become a common reason of introduction at
      phoniatric/pedaudiologic departments. The question arises whether this
      neurocognitive construct can be accounted with the standard clinical diagnostics.
      METHODS: The children with suspicion of APD referred to the Department of
      Phoniatrics/Pedaudiology at the University Hospital Goettingen/Germany were
      clinically examined. PATIENTS: Of 107 children 8 % demonstrated abnormal hearing 
      acuity, 7 % learning and intelligence disorders, 7 % developmental dyslexia, 6 % 
      language impairments, and 5 % attention deficit/hyperactivity. So, 59 children
      remained for evaluating for an APD (mean age: 85.3; SD 16.3 months). RESULTS:
      Their auditory performances were normdeviant from 7 % (speech audiometry) to 86 %
      (auditory sequential short-term memory for non-words). 55 % of the children
      exhibited a reduced dichotic word discrimination, 59 % a performance below norm
      level in auditory sequential memory for digits, and 86 % for non-words. Next
      step, the children of the study group were distributed according to their therapy
      situations at the time of examination: without; speech therapy; occupational
      therapy; speech therapy + occupational therapy. No significant group effects were
      found in the mean performances of the audiometric and psychometric tests, even
      though the results considerably differed. No auditory dimension made a
      contribution to separate the groups in a stepwise discriminant analysis.
      CONCLUSIONS: There was a notably inherent heterogeneity of the population
      presenting with auditory processing problems. The overall objective of the APD
      evaluation must be to assess processing skills apart from complex stimuli like
      language skills (e. g. parameter of tones, memory of tone pitch).

TI  - From genes to behavior in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1213-7
AB  - All four genes thus far linked to developmental dyslexia participate in brain
      development, and abnormalities in brain development are increasingly reported in 
      dyslexia. Comparable abnormalities induced in young rodent brains cause auditory 
      and cognitive deficits, underscoring the potential relevance of these brain
      changes to dyslexia. Our perspective on dyslexia is that some of the brain
      changes cause phonological processing abnormalities as well as auditory
      processing abnormalities; the latter, we speculate, resolve in a proportion of
      individuals during development, but contribute early on to the phonological
      disorder in dyslexia. Thus, we propose a tentative pathway between a genetic
      effect, developmental brain changes, and perceptual and cognitive deficits
      associated with dyslexia.

      the contrast sensitivity for drifting gratings at three spatial frequencies (1.0,

      memory in children with dyslexia.

TI  - Impaired neural networks for approximate calculation in dyscalculic children: a
      functional MRI study.
PG  - 31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a specific learning disability
      affecting the acquisition of mathematical skills in children with otherwise
      normal general intelligence. The goal of the present study was to examine
      cerebral mechanisms underlying DD. METHODS: Eighteen children with DD aged 11.2
      +/- 1.3 years and twenty age-matched typically achieving schoolchildren were
      investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during trials
      testing approximate and exact mathematical calculation, as well as magnitude
      comparison. RESULTS: Children with DD showed greater inter-individual variability
      and had weaker activation in almost the entire neuronal network for approximate
      calculation including the intraparietal sulcus, and the middle and inferior
      frontal gyrus of both hemispheres. In particular, the left intraparietal sulcus, 
      the left inferior frontal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus seem to play
      crucial roles in correct approximate calculation, since brain activation
      correlated with accuracy rate in these regions. In contrast, no differences
      between groups could be found for exact calculation and magnitude comparison. In 
      general, fMRI revealed similar parietal and prefrontal activation patterns in DD 
      children compared to controls for all conditions. CONCLUSION: In conclusion,
      there is evidence for a deficient recruitment of neural resources in children
      with DD when processing analog magnitudes of numbers.

TI  - Young stroke, cardiac myxoma, and multiple emboli: a case report and literature
      review.
PG  - 201-5
AB  - Cardiac myxoma is a source of emboli to the vascular tree, especially to the
      central nervous system. Although it is rare, its early recognition is
      particularly important because of its unique clinical features of subsequently
      leading to intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, even brain metastases, and
      its potential for surgical cure. Missing the diagnosis may lead to devastating
      results, including stroke, even sudden death. A 40-year-old male with no other
      conventional vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes or
      hyperlipidemia presented with right hemiplegia, global aphasia, vomiting, and
      fever. Infarction over the left middle cerebral artery was disclosed on magnetic 
      resonance imaging study, and echocardiogram showed a huge mass, about 5cm in
      size, on the mitral valve which was histopathologically proved to be a cardiac
      myxoma. He also presented with multiple emboli to the kidneys and the left eye.
      There is uncertainty about the role of anticoagulation. The treatment of choice
      remains surgical excision of the cardiac myxoma which may lead to normalization
      of serum interleukin-6 levels and resolution of constitutional symptoms, and the 
      intracranial aneurysms may regress and resolve.

TI  - Italian developmental dyslexic and proficient readers: where are the differences?
PG  - 347-51
AB  - Italian dyslexic children are characterized by a pervasive reading speed deficit,
      with relatively preserved accuracy. This pattern has been associated with
      predominant use of the nonlexical reading procedure. However, there is no
      evidence of a deficit in the lexical route of Italian dyslexics. We investigated 
      both lexical and nonlexical reading procedures in dyslexic children through two
      marker effects, namely, the word frequency effect and the effect of contextual
      grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules. Although dyslexics were slower and less
      accurate than controls, they were affected by word frequency, grapheme
      contextuality, and their interaction in a similar manner as average readers.
      These results show the use of lexical reading in Italian dyslexics, and refute
      the claim of a deficit in whole-word processing with consequent over-reliance on 
      the nonlexical route.

TI  - Do differences in brain activation challenge universal theories of dyslexia?
PG  - 341-3
AB  - It has been commonly agreed that developmental dyslexia in different languages
      has a common biological origin: a dysfunction of left posterior temporal brain
      regions dealing with phonological processes. Siok, Perfetti, Jin, and Tan (2004, 
      Nature, 431, 71-76) challenge this biological unity theory of dyslexia: Chinese
      dyslexics show no deficits in posterior temporal brain regions but a functional
      disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus. Here, I will argue that these data
      do not challenge universal cognitive theories of dyslexia according to which
      weaknesses in the ability to process the phonological features of language are at
      the origin of dyslexia.

TI  - Do phonologic and rapid automatized naming deficits differentially affect
      dyslexic children with and without a history of language delay? A study of
      Italian dyslexic children.
PG  - 141-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aims to verify whether phonologic and rapid automatized
      naming (RAN) deficits are present and associated in Italian dyslexic children and
      whether they differentially affect dyslexics with and without a history of
      previous language delay (LD). BACKGROUND: According to the phonologic core
      deficit hypothesis, dyslexia may stem from impairment of the representation and
      manipulation of phonemes and may be closely associated with oral language
      deficits. However, deficits in tasks not requiring fine-grained phonologic
      representations, such as RAN, have also been described in dyslexic children.
      METHODS: Thirty-seven children were selected on the basis of a reading deficit
      and were assigned to 2 groups according to whether or not they had a history of
      early LD as determined retrospectively by parental report. A battery of reading
      and writing, verbal working memory, metaphonologic, RAN, and visual search tests 
      were administered. RESULTS: RAN deficits were shared by most dyslexics (with and 
      without a history of LD), whereas phonologic deficits were mainly associated with
      a previous LD. This last condition did not result in a more profound impairment
      of reading and writing decoding skills. CONCLUSION: In a shallow orthography such
      as Italian, RAN, not phonologic deficits, may represent the main cognitive marker
      of developmental dyslexia.

      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 841-55
LID - 10.1080/02643290500483090 [doi]
AB  - Focused visuo-spatial attention was studied in 10 developmental dyslexic children
      with impaired nonword reading, 10 dyslexic children with intact nonword reading, 
      and 12 normally reading children. Reaction times to lateralized visual stimuli in
      a cued detection task showed that attentional facilitation of the target at the
      cued location was symmetrical in the three groups. However, dyslexics with
      impaired nonword reading selectively showed a lack of attentional inhibition for 
      targets at the uncued location in the right visual field. This result was
      replicated in a second group of 13 dyslexics with impaired nonword reading.
      Individual differences in the ability of right attentional inhibition across the 
      entire sample of dyslexics accounted for 17% of unique variance in nonword
      reading accuracy after controlling for individual differences in age, IQ, and
      phonological skills. A possible explanation based on the role of spatial
      attention mechanisms in the graphemic parsing process is discussed. Our results
      suggest that focused visuo-spatial attention may be crucial for nonword decoding.

AB  - We report the case of ET, a 7-year-old child with a severe developmental
      letter-processing impairment. Detailed assessment revealed multiple impairments
      of the letter-processing system affecting abstract visual letter representation, 
      semantics, and connections between the phonological processing modules and the
      orthographic buffer. Treatment methods focused on letter sounding through
      development of abstract visual representation and semantic representation of
      letters. Treatment resulted in dramatic and enduring improvements in cross-case
      matching, letter/number categorization, and letter sounding. Cognitive
      neuropsychological reading research has largely focused on word processing, with 
      a relative neglect of single-letter processing. The current study investigated
      letter processing in greater detail than has been usual and outlines a broad
      theoretical framework for letter processing. ET's assessment and treatment data
      are used to support and question predictions from the framework. A number of
      theoretical implications are discussed with reference to ET's data and that of
      other reported cases of impaired single-letter processing. Finally, the paucity
      of investigation of letter processing in children is highlighted, particularly
      with regard to integrity of abstract letter representation in developmental
      dyslexia.

TI  - From single to multiple deficit models of developmental disorders.
PG  - 385-413
AB  - The emerging etiological model for developmental disorders, like dyslexia, is
      probabilistic and multifactorial while the prevailing cognitive model has been
      deterministic and often focused on a single cognitive cause, such as a
      phonological deficit as the cause of dyslexia. So there is a potential
      contradiction in our explanatory frameworks for understanding developmental
      disorders. This paper attempts to resolve this contradiction by presenting a
      multiple cognitive deficit model of developmental disorders. It describes how
      this model evolved out of our attempts to understand two comorbidities, those
      between dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and between 
      dyslexia and speech sound disorder (SSD).

TI  - Tangled webs: tracing the connections between genes and cognition.
PG  - 270-97
AB  - The rise of molecular genetics is having a pervasive influence in a wide variety 
      of fields, including research into neurodevelopmental disorders like dyslexia,
      speech and language impairments, and autism. There are many studies underway
      which are attempting to determine the roles of genetic factors in the aetiology
      of these disorders. Beyond the obvious implications for diagnosis, treatment and 
      understanding, success in these efforts promises to shed light on the links
      between genes and aspects of cognition and behaviour. However, the deceptive
      simplicity of finding correlations between genetic and phenotypic variation has
      led to a common misconception that there exist straightforward linear
      relationships between specific genes and particular behavioural and/or cognitive 
      outputs. The problem is exacerbated by the adoption of an abstract view of the
      nature of the gene, without consideration of molecular, developmental or
      ontogenetic frameworks. To illustrate the limitations of this perspective, I
      select two cases from recent research into the genetic underpinnings of
      neurodevelopmental disorders. First, I discuss the proposal that dyslexia can be 
      dissected into distinct components specified by different genes. Second, I review
      the story of the FOXP2 gene and its role in human speech and language. In both
      cases, adoption of an abstract concept of the gene can lead to erroneous
      conclusions, which are incompatible with current knowledge of molecular and
      developmental systems. Genes do not specify behaviours or cognitive processes;
      they make regulatory factors, signalling molecules, receptors, enzymes, and so
      on, that interact in highly complex networks, modulated by environmental
      influences, in order to build and maintain the brain. I propose that it is
      necessary for us to fully embrace the complexity of biological systems, if we are
      ever to untangle the webs that link genes to cognition.

TI  - Genes, brain, and cognition: a roadmap for the cognitive scientist.
PG  - 247-69
AB  - This paper reviews current progress in genetics in relation to the understanding 
      of human cognition. It is argued that genetics occupies a prominent place in the 
      future of cognitive science, and that cognitive scientists should play an active 
      role in the process. Recent research in genetics and developmental neuroscience
      is reviewed and argued to provide a new perspective on the timeless questions of 
      innateness and modularity. The special case of the genetic bases of language is
      further discussed, with the study of developmental dyslexia as an exemplary entry
      point. This Special Issue puts together articles providing different empirical
      examples and theoretical perspectives on how the integration between the
      different levels of description (gene, brain, and cognition) is to be achieved.

TI  - [Is there a correlation between low-level auditory processing and phonological
      processing in preschool children?].
PG  - 715-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: It appears to be widely accepted that specific language impairment
      (SLI) and developmental dyslexia result from some form of phonological deficit.
      Some theorists contend that these deficits are directly and exclusively caused by
      a cognitive deficit specific to representation and processing of speech sound.
      However, separate theories hold that phonological deficits indeed may cause SLI
      or dyslexia but phonological deficits arise due to sensory, mainly auditory,
      deficits. Here we studied if there is a correlation between two hotly debated
      measures of auditory low-level processing and measures of phonological processing
      in preschool children. METHODS: Design: prospective study. Sample: preschool
      children. Variables: monaural and binaural temporal order judgement (TOJ(b) and
      TOJ(m)), several standardized measures of broad and narrow phonological
      processing (Bielefelder Screening BISC). Statistics: correlation analysis.
      RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between TOJ(b)/TOJ(m )and
      phonological processing. However, these data show that "impaired" TOJ(b) and
      TOJ(m) is neither a necessary nor a sufficient prerequisite for impaired
      phonological processing. DISCUSSION: Although TOJ(b) and TOJ(m) as measures of
      auditory low-level processing show a correlation with some measures of
      phonological processing, the precise nature of mechanisms leading to SLI or
      dyslexia still remains an unsolved problem.

TI  - Static postural control in children with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 211-5
AB  - The present investigation tries to better understand potential association and
      causal relationship between phonological and postural impairment due to
      developmental dyslexia. The study included 50 boys with developmental dyslexia
      and selected on the basis of their overall reading difficulties, and 42 control
      boys. Body sway during a quite standing posture eye open and eye closed on a
      force platform were tested in the two groups of subjects that were between 10 and
      13 years of age. Analysis of classical parameters quantifying the centre of
      pressure (CP) displacements along antero-posterior and lateral axes showed a
      significant difference between the two groups. Dyslexic children showed on
      average greater instability, with greater length, variability and mean power
      frequency of CP displacements with or without vision. Our results demonstrate
      that postural parameters may discriminate between children with dyslexia and
      age-equivalent controls.

TI  - Reduced speaking rate as an early predictor of reading disability.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated whether developmental reading disability could be
      predicted in children at the age of 30 months, according to 3 measures of speech 
      production: speaking rate, articulation rate, and the proportion of speaking time
      allocated to pausing. METHOD: Speech samples of 18 children at high risk and 10
      children at low risk for reading disability were recorded at 30 months of age.
      High risk was determined by history of reading disability in at least 1 of the
      child's parents. In grade school, a reading evaluation identified 9 children
      within the high-risk group as having reading disability and 9 children as not
      having reading disability. The 10 children at low risk for reading disability
      tested negative for reading disability. RESULTS: Children with reading disability
      showed a significantly slower speaking rate than children at high risk without
      reading disability. Children with reading disability allocated significantly more
      time to pausing, as compared with the other groups. Articulation rate did not
      differ significantly across groups. CONCLUSIONS: Speaking rate and the proportion
      of pausing time to speaking time may provide an early indication of reading
      outcome in children at high risk for reading disability.

TI  - Parietal function in good and poor readers.
PG  - 26
AB  - BACKGROUND: While there are many psychophysical reports of impaired magnocellular
      pathway function in developmental dyslexia (DD), few have investigated parietal
      function, the major projection of this pathway, in good and poor readers closely 
      matched for nonverbal intelligence. In view of new feedforward-feedback theories 
      of visual processing, impaired magnocellular function raises the question of
      whether all visually-driven functions or only those associated with parietal
      cortex functions are equally impaired and if so, whether parietal performance is 
      more closely related to general ability levels than reading ability. METHODS:
      Reading accuracy and performance on psychophysical tasks purported to selectively
      activate parietal cortex such as motion sensitivity, attentional tracking, and
      spatial localization was compared in 17 children with DD, 16 younger reading-age 
      matched (RA) control children, and 46 good readers of similar chronological-age
      (CA) divided into CA-HighIQ and a CA-LowIQ matched to DD group nonverbal IQ.
      RESULTS: In the age-matched groups no significant differences were found between 
      DD and CA controls on any of the tasks relating to parietal function, although
      performance of the DD group and their nonverbal IQ scores was always lower. As
      expected, CA and RA group comparisons indicated purported parietal functioning
      improves with age. No difference in performance was seen on any of the parietally
      driven tasks between the DD and age-nonverbal IQ matched groups, whereas
      performance differentiated the DD group from the age-matched, higher nonverbal IQ
      group on several such tasks. An unexpected statistical difference in performance 
      between lower reading age (DD and RA children) and all higher reading age (CA)
      children was seen on a test of chromatic sensitivity, whereas when high and low
      nonverbal IQ normal readers were compared performance was not different
      CONCLUSION: The results indicate that performance on purported parietal functions
      improves with age and may be more associated with nonverbal mentation than
      reading accuracy. Performance on a cognitively demanding task, traditionally
      considered to rely on ventral stream functions, was more related to reading
      accuracy.

TI  - Neuropsychological functioning in people with ADHD across the lifespan.
PG  - 466-85
AB  - ADHD is defined by behavioral characteristics similar to neuropsychological
      disorders of executive dysfunction. This paper is a literature review of the
      neurocognitive characteristics of ADHD from early childhood through adulthood.
      The author addresses the development of the concept of attention and executive
      function (EF) deficits in ADHD, clinical neuropsychological studies of
      pre-teenage children, teenagers and adults with ADHD, gender and the role of
      psychiatric co-morbidity including the relationship of learning disabilities to
      ADHD, heterogeneity of neuropsychological dysfunctions, experimental
      neuropsychological studies, the relationship of brain structure to function,
      psychopharmacology of ADHD, and clinical neuropsychological assessment. The group
      data clearly supports the hypothesis that executive dysfunctions are correlates
      of ADHD regardless of gender and age, and these EF deficits are exacerbated by
      co-morbidity with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. However, there is
      limited data on children under the age of 5, teenagers from age 13-18, and adults
      with ADHD over the age of 40. Studies of individual classification of people with
      ADHD compared to healthy, non-psychiatric controls do not support the use of
      neuropsychological tests for the clinical diagnosis of ADHD, and indicate that
      not all persons with ADHD have EF deficits. Some persons with ADHD may have
      deficits in brain reward systems that are relatively independent of EF
      impairments. Future research should clarify the multiple sources of ADHD
      impairments, continue to refine neuropsychological tools optimized for
      assessment, and incorporate longitudinal, developmental designs to understand
      ADHD across the lifespan.

TI  - Landau-Kleffner syndrome with mitochondrial respiratory chain-complex I
      deficiency.
PG  - 158-61
AB  - Landau-Kleffner syndrome is characterized by epileptic aphasia associated with
      electrical status epilepticus of slow wave sleep. A 5-year-old female, who had
      manifested normal developmental progress, was referred with principal complaints 
      of fluctuating sensory aphasia and bizarre behavior during the preceding 4
      months. Landau-Kleffner syndrome was confirmed by clinical and
      electroencephalographic features; in addition, the patient's mitochondrial
      respiratory chain-complex I deficiency was confirmed by fibroblast culture with
      the evidence of energy metabolism disorder. This patient's seizures were
      intractable to many antiepileptic drugs, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and
      intravenous immunoglobulin, with catastrophic cognitive and behavioral decline,
      but the seizures were successfully controlled by ketogenic diet with
      supplementary mitochondrial cocktail including coenzyme Q10, riboflavin,
      L-carnitine, and high-dose multivitamins. The patient finally regained fully
      normal cognitive functioning. Landau-Kleffner syndrome with mitochondrial
      respiratory chain-complex I deficiency was controlled in this case by ketogenic
      diet and supplementary mitochondrial cocktail therapy.

TI  - Impaired duration mismatch negativity in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1051-5
AB  - A mismatch negativity event-related potential protocol was administered to
      dyslexic children and their respective controls to test whether a specific
      auditory deficit concerning phonetic processing or a lower level auditory
      processing deficit was present in developmental dyslexia. Three different
      contrast conditions were explored, including nonphonological sounds, contrasted
      in pitch and duration, and phonemes. Mismatch negativity amplitudes differed
      significantly between groups in the duration condition, whereas no differences
      were found in the frequency and phoneme conditions. Moreover, the dyslexic
      children had delayed mismatch negativity latencies in the three contrast
      conditions. Our results suggest a deficit in low-level auditory discrimination in
      dyslexic children, in particular when detecting stimulus duration, and support
      the rapid auditory processing theory of dyslexia.

TI  - [What should be done when a child cannot learn to read?].
PG  - 1071-5
AB  - When a child faces difficulties in learning to read, clinicians should, first of 
      all, examine cognitive functions. The actual reading level is checked using a
      test calibrated on normal reading development. They are thus able to
      differentiate between global learning disorders (related to mental deficiency or 
      pervasive disorders) and specific reading impairment. Specific reading impairment
      might be a simple delay or developmental dyslexia. We described the first
      at-school training, as well as the criteria of speech therapy.

TI  - Interhemispheric communication involving multiple tasks: A study of children with
      dyslexia.
PG  - 89-101
AB  - The study investigated whether inefficient interhemispheric communication is
      involved in developmental dyslexia using multiple tasks. A finger localization
      task, rhyming judgment task, primed lexical decision task, and a visual
      half-field presentation paradigm were used. Nineteen dyslexic children (mean age 
      = 13.1 years) were compared with 26 chronological age-matched normal children.
      Although the dyslexic group demonstrated significantly slower and less accurate
      performance in all three tasks, there was no significant group difference in term
      of interhemispheric communication. However, priming effects demonstrated by the
      dyslexic group (p < .05) further indicate that their reading problems may stem
      from the word retrieval process from the long term memory.

TI  - Developmental amnesia: Fractionation of developing memory systems.
PG  - 762-88
LID - 10.1080/02643290500538315 [doi]
AB  - Study of the developmental amnesias utilizing a cognitive neuropsychological
      methodology has highlighted the dissociations that may occur between the
      development of components of memory. M.M., a new case of developmental amnesia,
      was identified after screening from the normal population on cognitive and memory
      measures. Retrospective investigation found that he was of low birthweight. M.M. 
      had impaired semantic memory for knowledge of facts and words. There was impaired
      episodic memory for words and stories but intact episodic memory for visual
      designs and features. This forms a double dissociation with Dr S. (Temple, 1992),
      who had intact verbal but impaired visual episodic memory. M.M. also had impaired
      autobiographical episodic memory. Nevertheless, learning over repeated trials
      occurred, consistent with previous theorizing that learning is not simply the
      effect of recurrent episodic memory. Nor is it the same as establishing semantic 
      memory, since for M.M. semantic memory is also impaired. Within reading, there
      was an impaired lexico-semantic system, elevated levels of homophone confusion,
      but intact phonological reading, consistent with surface dyslexia and raising
      issues about the interrelationship of the semantic system and literacy
      development. The results are compatible with discrete semi-independent components
      within memory development, whereby deficits are associated with residual
      normality, but there may also be an explicit relationship between the semantic
      memory system and both vocabulary and reading acquisition.

PG  - 748-61
LID - 10.1080/02643290500438607 [doi]
AB  - Does sensorimotor dysfunction underlie reading impairment? To investigate this
      question, a battery of literacy, phonology, auditory, visual, and motor tests
      were administered to age- and ability-matched groups of dyslexic, autistic, and
      control children. As in previous studies, only a subset of the dyslexic children 
      had sensory and/or motor impairments, whilst some dyslexics were entirely spared,
      suggesting that sensorimotor impairments are not necessary to cause reading
      disability. A subset of autistic children was also found to have sensorimotor
      impairments; however, some of these children did not have reading problems,
      suggesting that sensorimotor impairments are not sufficient to cause reading
      disability. We conclude that sensorimotor and reading impairments are doubly
      dissociable. Sensorimotor impairments do not seem to be the cause of reading
      disability, but can be seen as nonspecific markers for developmental disorder.

TI  - Implicit learning is intact in adult developmental dyslexic readers: evidence
      from the serial reaction time task and artificial grammar learning.
PG  - 808-27
AB  - Previous research yielded equivocal results concerning implicit learning
      abilities of developmental dyslexic readers. These studies employed a sequence
      learning task that requires a motor response to each stimulus. However, implicit 
      learning has been often studied using non-motor tasks. Thus, we investigated
      implicit learning capabilities of adult developmental dyslexic readers in two
      standard implicit learning paradigms differing in the involvement of the motor
      system, namely the serial response time task (SRTT) and artificial grammar
      learning (AGL).Twelve adult developmental dyslexic and twelve age- and sex-
      matched normal readers were tested. In the serial response time task (SRTT),
      participants are exposed to a structured display. Learning is measured by
      comparing response time (RT) to the structured sequence with RT to a random
      display. In the artificial grammar learning task (AGL), letter strings following 
      a markovian finite state grammar are presented. In a subsequent test phase
      subjects have to judge new letter strings according to their grammaticality.
      Learning of the stimulus regularities was found in both tasks and for both groups
      of subjects. Furthermore, participants were unaware of the underlying stimulus
      construction principles. Dyslexic readers were unimpaired in SRTT as well as
      artificial grammar learning relative to normal readers. These findings show that 
      implicit learning is intact in dyslexia. Intact implicit learning capabilities
      should be taken into account when designing training programs for developmental
      dyslexic readers.

TI  - Developmental cognitive genetics: how psychology can inform genetics and vice
      versa.
PG  - 1153-68
AB  - Developmental neuropsychology is concerned with uncovering the underlying basis
      of developmental disorders such as specific language impairment (SLI),
      developmental dyslexia, and autistic disorder. Twin and family studies indicate
      that genetic influences play an important part in the aetiology of all of these
      disorders, yet progress in identifying genes has been slow. One way forward is to
      cut loose from conventional clinical criteria for diagnosing disorders and to
      focus instead on measures of underlying cognitive mechanisms. Psychology can
      inform genetics by clarifying what the key dimensions are for heritable
      phenotypes. However, it is not a one-way street. By using genetically informative
      designs, one can gain insights about causal relationships between different
      cognitive deficits. For instance, it has been suggested that low-level auditory
      deficits cause phonological problems in SLI. However, a twin study showed that,
      although both types of deficit occur in SLI, they have quite different origins,
      with environmental factors more important for auditory deficit, and genes more
      important for deficient phonological short-term memory. Another study found that 
      morphosyntactic deficits in SLI are also highly heritable, but have different
      genetic origins from impairments of phonological short-term memory. A genetic
      perspective shows that a search for the underlying cause of developmental
      disorders may be misguided, because they are complex and heterogeneous and are
      associated with multiple risk factors that only cause serious disability when
      they occur in combination.

LID - 10.1080/02643290500412545 [doi]
AB  - Previous research suggests that children with developmental dyslexia have
      low-level visual and auditory deficits. The present study further examines these 
      proposed deficits and how they relate to component reading skills. Children with 
      dyslexia and control children were administered measures of visual and auditory
      processing and a battery of reading tasks, including nonword and irregular-word
      reading, as measures of phonological and orthographic skills. Significant group
      differences were found on all visual and auditory tasks. However, at an
      individual level only a minority of dyslexics had visual and auditory deficits.
      In both dyslexics and controls, visual processing was not related to component
      reading skills, while weak associations were found between auditory processing
      and phonological decoding skills. The results of the present study suggest that
      dyslexia is not characterized by core deficits in visual and auditory processing.
      The results are discussed in terms of a general nonsensory problem with task
      completion.

TI  - The genetics of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 681-9
AB  - Reading reflects the complex integration of several cognitive processes and
      proves more difficult to achieve for a significant proportion of the population. 
      Developmental dyslexia (DD), or specific reading disability, is influenced by
      genes, a fact that has led several research groups to attempt to identify
      susceptibility genes through the sequential analysis of genetic linkage and
      association. Strong evidence has now emerged for the presence of genes
      influencing DD at several chromosomal loci and for at least one of these, there
      is evidence implicating specific genes. In this review, we present the evidence
      for a genetic contribution to DD and its component processes and review the
      current status of molecular genetic research aimed at identifying susceptibility 
      genes for this common, complex disorder.

TI  - Double vena cava filter insertion in congenital duplicated inferior vena cava: a 
      case report and literature review.
PG  - ECR30
AB  - The complex embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may result in several
      anomalies, often presenting as an incidental radiological finding. In addition to
      the differential diagnosis with pathological lesions, recognizing IVC defects is 
      crucial for invasive procedures. This report describes a patient with a right
      femoral vein thrombosis who could not be given anticoagulant therapy due to a
      concomitant acute cerebral hemorrhage. He was found to have an asymptomatic
      duplicated IVC with interiliac communication. A filter had to be inserted in each
      vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolism. A review of the literature dealing with 
      the few reported cases of filter insertion in congenital duplicated IVC is
      presented.

      Brain, 124, 510-521, 2001] all highlight the importance of the left posterior
      fusiform cortex in visual word recognition. We used visual masked priming and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the specific functional
      contribution of this region to reading and found that (1) unlike words,
      repetition of pseudowords ("solst-solst") did not produce a neural priming effect
      in this region, (2) orthographically related words such as "corner-corn" did
      produce a neural priming effect, but (3) this orthographic priming effect was
      reduced when prime-target pairs were semantically related ("teacher-teach").
      These findings conflict with the notion of stored visual word forms and instead
      suggest that this region acts as an interface between visual form information and
      higher order stimulus properties such as its associated sound and meaning. More
      importantly, this function is not specific to reading but is also engaged when
      processing any meaningful visual stimulus.

TI  - What can functional brain imaging studies tell us about typical and atypical
      cognitive development in children?
PG  - 333-41
AB  - Functional brain imaging has been largely reserved for adults. However, in recent
      years there have been increasing attempts to use functional brain imaging to
      inform our understanding of child development. These have taken three main forms:
      (1) Children with known or suspected neurological disorders may undergo brain
      imaging for medical diagnostic purposes and/or for the purpose of research into
      the nature of the disorders. (2) There have been a few studies where children,
      usually over the age of 8, have undergone functional brain imaging. (3) Results
      from brain imaging studies of adults have influenced theories about children's
      development. This chapter discusses the impact of brain imaging studies on our
      understanding of working memory; reading; and arithmetic. The different forms of 
      brain imaging converge in demonstrating that different brain regions show
      differential activation for different domains and for different components within
      the domains: e.g. different reading strategies and different components of
      arithmetic. They show important similarities between children and adults, though 
      it must be remembered that very few studies have involved young children. They
      also indicate that experience influences brain function, as well as the other way
      around.

TI  - Do children with developmental dyslexia show a selective visual attention
      deficit?
PG  - 85-93
AB  - The authors investigated the performance of children with developmental dyslexia 
      on a number of visual tasks requiring selective visual attention. Dyslexic
      children did not show the overestimation of the left visual field
      (pseudo-neglect) characteristic of normal adult vision. The performance of
      dyslexic children in texture segmentation and feature search tasks was identical 
      to that of control children matched for age, gender and intelligence. However,
      when tested on conjunction tasks for orientation and form, dyslexic children
      showed shorter reaction times and a dramatically increased number of errors.
      Differences between the two groups decreased with increasing age. These results
      suggest that children with developmental dyslexia present selective deficits in
      visual attention.

TI  - A processing speed deficit in dyslexic adults? Evidence from a peg-moving task.
PG  - 264-7
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is diagnosed when literacy skills are not commensurate
      with a person's general cognitive ability and education. While the most common
      difficulty found in dyslexia is poor phonological processing, many dyslexics are 
      reported to be clumsy, with poor handwriting, suggesting that there may be a
      motor deficit in dyslexia. To establish whether the motor difficulties described 
      in dyslexic children persist into adulthood, we tested 18 dyslexic adults and 22 
      control participants on Annett's peg-moving task. The dyslexic participants
      performed significantly slower than control adults on the peg-moving task with
      their dominant hands (p=0.004). Furthermore, response times (RTs) during tasks
      testing component literacy skills correlated with peg-moving ability in the
      dominant hand in the entire group (orthographic r=0.448, p=0.005; phonological
      r=0.383, p=0.025). These results indicate that a motor speed deficit in dyslexia 
      may not be simply a sign of developmental delay, but may persist into adulthood. 
      Furthermore, motor speed may be related to the speed at which literacy
      information is processed.

TI  - The chromosome 6p22 haplotype associated with dyslexia reduces the expression of 
      KIAA0319, a novel gene involved in neuronal migration.
PG  - 1659-66
AB  - Dyslexia is one of the most prevalent childhood cognitive disorders, affecting
      approximately 5% of school-age children. We have recently identified a risk
      haplotype associated with dyslexia on chromosome 6p22.2 which spans the TTRAP
      gene and portions of THEM2 and KIAA0319. Here we show that in the presence of the
      risk haplotype, the expression of the KIAA0319 gene is reduced but the expression
      of the other two genes remains unaffected. Using in situ hybridization, we detect
      a very distinct expression pattern of the KIAA0319 gene in the developing
      cerebral neocortex of mouse and human fetuses. Moreover, interference with rat
      Kiaa0319 expression in utero leads to impaired neuronal migration in the
      developing cerebral neocortex. These data suggest a direct link between a
      specific genetic background and a biological mechanism leading to the development
      of dyslexia: the risk haplotype on chromosome 6p22.2 down-regulates the KIAA0319 
      gene which is required for neuronal migration during the formation of the
      cerebral neocortex.

TI  - Expanding the phenotypic spectrum of L1CAM-associated disease.
PG  - 414-9
AB  - Mutations in the L1CAM gene cause neurological abnormalities of variable
      severity, including congenital hydrocephalus, agenesis of the corpus callosum,
      spastic paraplegia, bilaterally adducted thumbs, aphasia, and mental retardation.
      Inter- and intrafamilial variability is a well-known feature of the L1CAM
      spectrum, and several patients have a combination of L1CAM mutations and
      Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). We report on two siblings with a missense mutation
      in exon 7 (p.P240L) of the L1CAM gene. In one of the siblings, congenital
      dislocation of the radial heads and HSCR were present. Neither patient had
      hydrocephalus, adducted thumbs, or absent speech, but both had a hypoplastic
      corpus callosum. We suggest that L1CAM mutation testing should be considered in
      male patients with a positive family history compatible with X-linked inheritance
      and either the combination of agenesis of the CC and HSCR or the combination of
      agenesis of the CC and limb abnormalities, including abnormalities other than
      adducted thumbs.

TI  - Lexical learning and dysgraphia in a group of adults with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 376-400
LID - 10.1080/02643290442000545 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the ability to learn new words in a group of 22 adults with
      developmental dyslexia/dysgraphia and the relationship between their learning and
      spelling problems. We identified a deficit that affected the ability to learn
      both spoken and written new words (lexical learning deficit). There were no
      comparable problems in learning other kinds of representations (lexical/semantic 
      and visual) and the deficit could not be explained in terms of more traditional
      phonological deficits associated with dyslexia (phonological awareness,
      phonological STM). Written new word learning accounted for further variance in
      the severity of the dysgraphia after phonological abilities had been partialled
      out. We suggest that lexical learning may be an independent ability needed to
      create lexical/formal representations from a series of independent units.
      Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

TI  - Brain responses to subject-verb agreement violations in spoken language in
      developmental dyslexia: an ERP study.
PG  - 134-49
AB  - This study investigates the presence and latency of the P600 component in
      response to subject-verb agreement violations in spoken language in people with
      and without developmental dyslexia. The two groups performed at-ceiling level on 
      judging the sentences on their grammaticality, but the ERP data revealed subtle
      differences between them. The P600 tended to peak later in the left posterior
      region in the dyslexic group compared with the control group. In addition, the
      group of dyslexic subjects did not show a P600 in response to sentences with a
      plural NP subject. These results suggest that brain activation involved in
      syntactic repair is more affected by linguistic complexity in developmental
      dyslexia compared with non-dyslexic individuals.

TI  - Stability of IQ measures in teenagers and young adults with developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 81-95
AB  - A follow-up study was performed to investigate the stability of IQ measures in a 
      group of dyslexic teenagers and young adults. Earlier research had shown
      contradictory results. The 65 subjects, 12 years old on the average at first
      test, were retested after a mean interval of six and a half years. There was a
      significant relative decrease in verbal IQ (VIQ), which was interpreted as either
      an effect of low reliability of tests used, or an effect of the dyslexic
      individuals' less experience with reading and writing, and as a consequence, a
      lag in verbal ability, the second interpretation being in line with earlier
      findings in groups of children with learning disabilities. Performance IQ
      improved significantly and the tentative interpretation was that of a
      compensatory process, in the sense that the dyslexic children might develop a
      more visual, intuitive and creative way to process information and solve
      problems. The conclusion was that caution should be taken, before making
      important decisions on the basis of a single intelligence test, and that dyslexic
      children might be at risk to lag behind their peers in terms of VIQ, especially
      if they are not provided with suitable special education.

TI  - Neuroplasticity as a double-edged sword: deaf enhancements and dyslexic deficits 
      in motion processing.
PG  - 701-14
AB  - We examined the hypothesis that aspects of processing that are most modifiable by
      experience (i.e., "plastic") display the most vulnerability in developmental
      disorders and the most compensatory enhancement after sensory deprivation. A
      large literature reports that motion processing and magnocellular visual function
      is selectively deficient in dyslexia. A smaller literature reports enhancements
      in such functions in deaf individuals. However, studies with dyslexic and deaf
      individuals have used different experimental paradigms to assess visual function,
      and no research has yet examined both sides of modifiability (i.e., enhancements 
      and deficits) using the same experimental paradigm. In the present research,
      visual function was compared in dyslexic (n=15), deaf (n=17), and control adults 
      by using automated peripheral kinetic and foveal static perimetry. In the kinetic
      perimetry task, the dyslexic group showed deficits ( p<.003), whereas the deaf
      group showed enhancements ( p<.001) for detecting moving light points in the
      periphery. In the foveal static perimetry task, neither the dyslexic ( p=.866)
      nor the deaf ( p=.632) group differed significantly from controls in foveal
      contrast sensitivity thresholds, and no group or individual approached ceiling
      performance on this task. Taken together, the present data bridge previous
      literatures and suggest that motion processing tasks are selectively modifiable, 
      either to decrement or enhancement, whereas foveal contrast sensitivity does not 
      differ in dyslexic or deaf groups.

TI  - Clinical use of AEVP- and AERP-measures in childhood speech disorders.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - It has long been recognized that from the first months of life auditory
      perception plays a crucial role in speech and language development. Only in
      recent years, however, is the precise mechanism of auditory development and its
      interaction with the acquisition of speech and language beginning to be
      systematically revealed. This paper presents the results of a series of studies
      exploring the relevance of electrophysiological measurements for the objective
      diagnosis of children with language and speech disorders. In the first,
      retrospective, study, an inventory was made of clinical neurological,
      neuropsychological, logopedic and neurophysiological findings obtained from 43
      children referred to the Paediatric Neurology Centre for the diagnosis of their
      speech and language deficits. Neurophysiological abnormalities were found in 95% 
      of these children, among these deviant auditory evoked potentials (AEVPs). The
      second study demonstrated developmental trends in the waveform of the cortical
      AEVPs up to age 6 years; the implications for longitudinal studies are discussed.
      Preliminary results from the third study show emerging differences in auditory
      event-related potentials (AERPs) for young children who are at risk for
      developmental dyslexia based on their family history. These findings underscore
      the clinical usefulness of neurophysiological measures for the diagnosis of
      speech-language disorders. Clinical protocols are further developed and tested.

TI  - Omega-3 fatty acids in ADHD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.
PG  - 155-72
AB  - Omega-3 fatty acids are dietary essentials, and are critical to brain development
      and function. Increasing evidence suggests that a relative lack of omega-3 may
      contribute to many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. This review
      focuses on the possible role of omega-3 in attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) and related childhood developmental disorders, evaluating the
      existing evidence from both research and clinical perspectives. Theory and
      experimental evidence support a role for omega-3 in ADHD, dyslexia, developmental
      coordination disorder (DCD) and autism. Results from controlled treatment trials 
      are mixed, but the few studies in this area have involved different populations
      and treatment formulations. Dietary supplementation with fish oils (providing EPA
      and DHA) appears to alleviate ADHD-related symptoms in at least some children,
      and one study of DCD children also found benefits for academic achievement.
      Larger trials are now needed to confirm these findings, and to establish the
      specificity and durability of any treatment effects as well as optimal
      formulations and dosages. Omega-3 is not supported by current evidence as a
      primary treatment for ADHD or related conditions, but further research in this
      area is clearly warranted. Given their relative safety and general health
      benefits, omega-3 fatty acids offer a promising complementary approach to
      standard treatments.

TI  - Development of auditory saltation and its relationship to reading and
      phonological processing.
PG  - 352-66
AB  - PURPOSE: The temporal offset of auditory saltation is thought to be reflective of
      the limits of temporal resolution, and has recently been used to compare dyslexic
      and control adults and children, with mixed results (R. Hari & P. Kiesila, 1996; 
      M. Kronbichler, F. Hutzler, & H. Wimmer, 2002). This study sought to document and
      understand normative changes in saltation thresholds as a function of age, and
      examine the relationship of saltation thresholds to reading and phonological
      processing across development. METHOD: This study used a cross-sectional
      developmental design. Groups of 7-8-, 9-10-, and 11-13-year-old children, and
      adults, undertook a 2-alternative forced-choice saltation task, along with
      standard tests of reading and phonological processing. RESULTS: Significantly
      higher and more variable saltation thresholds were evident in the 7-8-year-old
      group. Group distributions were skewed: Only a few young children obtained poor
      thresholds while most showed adult-like performance. Saltation thresholds were
      not related to reading or phonological processing skills at any stage of
      development. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal offset of saltation is unlikely to reflect
      the true limits of temporal resolution in young children, but rather the
      conflation of perceptual and nonperceptual factors (such as poor short-term
      memory, inattention, and confusion) to task performance. Effort should be made to
      minimize such nonperceptual factors, particularly when using saltation as a
      measure of temporal resolution in participants with dyslexia.

TI  - Post-traumatic stress disorder in Polish stroke patients who survived Nazi
      concentration camps.
PG  - CR137-49
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many persons who survived Nazi concentration camps are now in
      advanced age, so that rehabilitation centers in Poland are seeing increasing
      numbers of such patients, especially after strokes. In many cases, the process of
      rehabilitation is severely hampered by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
      while the neuropsychological consequences of the stroke itself often evoke
      traumatic memories and simultaneously disorganize or destroy the patient's
      previous coping mechanisms. The present study describes the program developed by 
      the authors for concentration camp survivors in post-stroke rehabilitation,
      including the use of art therapy and specially prepared films to help the
      patients cope with PTSD. MATERIAL/METHODS: The experimental group (KL) consisted 
      of 8 such patients (4 men, 4 women, average age 79.1+/-4.28) with mild
      post-stroke aphasia who went through the PTSD program, while the comparison group
      (C) included 8 post-stroke patients, matched for age and gender, who were not
      concentration camp survivors and showed no premorbid symptoms of PTSD. All
      subjects were tested at baseline and again 3 months later, using structured
      interview and observation, self-rating scales for three basic negative emotions
      (anger, anxiety and sadness) and the Frustration and Aggression Test for the
      Disabled. RESULTS: The results showed significant differences between the groups 
      at baseline, while at follow-up the differences between groups had changed in
      both extent and distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative analysis of the results
      allows for some important observations about the etiology and course of PTSD in
      these persons.

TI  - Effects of visual hemisphere-specific stimulation versus reading-focused training
      in dyslexic children.
PG  - 194-212
AB  - Two groups of children with developmental dyslexia were treated over a period of 
      four months. Fourteen children received visual hemisphere-specific stimulation
      (VHSS) and 11 children were treated with a customary, reading-focused training
      programme (RT). Reading performance was investigated before and after treatment, 
      as were spelling abilities, phonemic awareness and verbal memory. Improvement in 
      reading accuracy was significantly greater in the VHSS group than in the RT
      group. Significant improvements were also observed for memory and phonemic
      skills. The results were compared to existing data on spontaneous reading
      development. The better results after single-hemisphere stimulation (VHSS) are
      discussed in terms of the specific characteristics of the treatment, and of the
      possible contributions of visual-spatial attention, memory functions and phonemic
      awareness.

TI  - Altered hemispheric asymmetry during word processing in dyslexic children: an
      event-related potential study.
PG  - 429-33
AB  - The present event-related potential study aimed at finding neurophysiological
      correlates of inadequate reading performances in developmental dyslexia. By using
      the same set of words in different linguistic tasks, we found variations of
      cortical asymmetry between dyslexic individuals and controls starting with the
      N420, a component supposed to index the phonological processing during reading.
      Whereas in controls this component was left lateralized, in disabled readers it
      was more distributed across hemispheres. The observed lack of lateralization in
      dyslexic individuals was also found in the later slow negative wave that
      developed in the 700 to 1500-ms time interval. We postulate that the altered
      asymmetry is related to an impairment of the grapheme-phoneme conversion
      mechanism. The findings would therefore support the hypothesis of a phonological 
      deficit underlying this learning disability.

TI  - When phonology fails: orthographic neighbourhood effects in dyslexia.
PG  - 318-29
AB  - Both cerebral hemispheres contain phonological, orthographic and semantic
      representations of words, however there are between-hemisphere differences in the
      relative engagement and specialization of the different representations. Taking
      orthographic processing for example, previous studies suggest that orthographic
      neighbourhood size (N) has facilitatory effects in the right but not the left
      hemispheres. To pursue the nature of this asymmetric N effect, in particular
      whether there are individual differences in such specialisation, we examined N in
      a case of developmental dyslexia, FM. We first describe the nature of his
      difficulties, which are mainly severe phonological deficits. Employing the
      divided visual field paradigm with FM revealed a greater sensitivity in the right
      than in the left hemisphere to orthographic variables, with a significant
      inhibitory N effect in the left, but not right hemisphere. Such inhibition, to a 
      lesser degree, was found among a group of adults with dyslexia but not among
      age-matched normal readers. We argue that enhanced sensitivity to orthographic
      cues is developed in some cases of dyslexia when a normal, phonology-based left
      hemisphere word recognition processing is not achieved. The interpretation
      presented here is cast in terms of differences between people with dyslexia and
      typical readers that originate in the atypical way in which orthographic
      representations are initially set up.

TI  - GJB2 mutations and additional disabilities in a pediatric cochlear implant
      population.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss due to
      GJB2 mutations have often been deemed good cochlear implant candidates. Studies
      on children with GJB2 mutations and cochlear implants have typically excluded
      children with additional disabilities. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of 
      additional disabilities among children with and without GJB2 mutations in a
      cochlear implant population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed 
      of children with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) who received a
      cochlear implant between 1993 and 2004. RESULTS: Among 108 children within the
      cochlear implant database; 46 patients met the inclusion criteria of idiopathic
      non-syndromic hearing loss. Sixteen children had GJB2 mutations, 12 were GJB2
      negative, and 17 did not receive GJB2 testing but had no other identifiable
      etiology or risk factor contributing to hearing loss. The proportion of children 
      with additional disabilities that would affect either pre-operative assessments
      or post-operative results in the GJB2 positive group was 44% compared to 33% of
      children in the GJB2 negative. Additional disabilities were present in 41% of the
      children who did not receive GJB2 testing. The disabilities in the GJB2 positive 
      group included specific learning disability, apraxia, epileptiform aphasia,
      attention deficit disorder, global developmental delay, and gross motor delay.
      The GJB2 negative and those children not receiving GJB2 testing had motor delays,
      language delay, autism, specific learning disability, and attention deficit
      disorder. The proportion of children with at least 6 months CI use who relied on 
      oral communication was 62% in the GJB2 positive group, 66% in the GJB2 negative
      group, and 38% in the untested group. A majority of the genetic alleles were
      35delG (81%) and 10 of 16 (63%) patients with GJB2 mutations were homozygous
      35delG. The rate of developmental diagnoses was similar in patients with
      homozygous GJB2 compared to compound heterozygous genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The
      presence of biallelic GJB2 mutations does not rule out non-hearing related
      disorders that can have an effect on speech, language and learning. Forty-four
      percent of children with GJB2 mutations had other conditions that could directly 
      affect pre-implant evaluation and post-implant performance. This rate is similar 
      to the reported prevalence among the overall population of children with hearing 
      loss. All children should have a comprehensive evaluation of development and
      behavior regardless of the etiology of hearing loss.

TI  - Outcome of stroke in Saudi children.
PG  - S91-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report on the prognosis, neurologic outcome, and recurrences of
      stroke in Saudi children. METHODS: We evaluated a cohort of 104 Saudi children
      with stroke at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University
      Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from
      July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 
      (prospective study). We analyzed the salient clinical, neuroimaging,
      neurophysiological, neuropsychological and laboratory data following retrieval
      from a specialty designed comprehensive protocol. RESULTS: Of the 104 children in
      the cohort (aged one month to 12 years), 5 (4.8%) died during the study period
      and 9 (8.7%) were lost to follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up for the
      remaining 90 children was 40 months (median 33 months). Recovery was judged
      complete in 6 (6.7%) of these 90 children. We detected residual hemiparesis
      (irrespective of its effect on daily functions) in 73 (81%) and this was combined
      with other motor deficits in 45 children (50%). Forty-one children (46%) had
      residual dysphasia or language deficits, whereas 45 (50%) were judged to have had
      cognitive deficit. Psychometry revealed an abnormal intelligence quotient test
      (<70) in 19 of 26 (73%) children. Other neurologic sequelae included epilepsy in 
      52 (58%), recurrent headaches in 13 (14%) and hydrocephalus in 4 (4.4%) patients.
      Six of the 95 (6.3%) children, who were ascertained to have died or kept their
      follow-up, had one or more recurrences, one month to 5 years after the initial
      stroke (median 23 months). Patients who had recurrent strokes were significantly 
      more likely to be the product of consanguineous marriages (p=0.04). Regarding the
      group of 23 children with perinatal stroke, neither deaths nor recurrences
      occurred during the follow-up period. However, 20 (87%) of them had significant
      delays in their developmental milestones. CONCLUSIONS: The toll of stroke in
      Saudi children is demanding, with most children demonstrating persistent
      neurologic or cognitive deficits. Primary prevention for recurrences is feasible 
      through informed genetic counseling.

TI  - Impaired visual processing of letter and digit strings in adult dyslexic readers.
PG  - 718-23
AB  - The slow word reading of developmental dyslexics may stem from a string
      processing impairment which in turn reflects visual attentional deficits. We
      indeed found substantially enhanced recognition time thresholds in the dyslexic
      adult readers. However, their position profiles were hard to reconcile with any
      of the discussed visual attentional deficit hypotheses and with the prediction
      that dyslexic readers suffer from an absent string processing system as they
      exhibited similar M-shaped position profiles for digit and letter strings as the 
      normal reading controls.

TI  - [Techniques for the functional evaluation of neurodevelopmental disorders].
PG  - S71-81
AB  - AIM: To review the evaluation of neuropsychological functions by using
      non-invasive functional neuroimaging methods. DEVELOPMENT: Non-invasive
      functional neuroimaging methods can be sorted into two broad categories: the
      first includes those that make use of electromagnetic techniques, such as
      event-related potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the second
      consists of those involving haemodynamic techniques, such as positron emission
      tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. These methods have been
      employed in particular to evaluate the following functions: attention,
      perception, imagination, language, working memory, semantic retrieval, episodic
      memory, episodic memory retrieval, priming and procedural memory. The capacity of
      MEG, both for analysis and for organising the information it receives, is so
      large that it takes only a few milliseconds to evaluate brain activity and to
      create functional maps of the brain in which the brain structure is set out in
      blocks of cubic centimetres or even millimetres. This makes it possible to
      generate functional maps of brain activity that are capable of being organised
      and represented in terms of both time and space. It also enables us to obtain
      images that result from the signalling activity of sets of nerve cells
      (especially from the dendritic currents) and the electromagnetic signal that
      carries this information to the outer surface of the head, where the magnetic
      flow can be recorded. CONCLUSIONS: With the findings from these studies it has
      become possible to establish a topographic correlation between the functions and 
      the basic brain processes involved in each paradigm. A growing body of clinical
      evidence proves the value of using them (especially MEG) with cases of epilepsy, 
      language, dyslexia, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

TI  - [The neurobiological foundations of learning disabilities].
PG  - S171-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Learning disabilities constitute a heterogeneous group of disorders
      that involve significant alterations in different cognitive domains (acquisition 
      and use of language, reasoning, mathematical skills, visuospatial abilities, and 
      so forth) that are not accounted for by a low level of intelligence, inadequate
      sociocultural development or lack of academic opportunities. They result from an 
      alteration in basic psychological processes, developmentally linked to an
      alteration in the central nervous system. Current functional neuroimaging
      techniques have made it possible to develop a new type of approach to the
      neurofunctional foundations underlying these disorders, especially with regard to
      difficulties in the realm of reading/ writing (developmental dyslexia) and
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which have their highest
      incidence among the infantile population of school-age children. DEVELOPMENT:
      Neuroimaging studies have revealed a pattern of atypical activity in both kinds
      of disorders. In the case of dyslexia, alterations have been observed in the
      perisylvian circuits that underlie the mechanisms involved in reading skills.
      Studies into ADHD suggest a fronto-striatal dysfunction linked to the
      difficulties encountered to achieve inhibitory control, as well as alterations in
      the inferior parietal and posterior temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Functional
      neuroimaging studies have shown that the clinical manifestations of these
      disorders are not only due to a dysfunction in specific areas of the brain, but
      also to alterations in the pattern of connectivity.

TI  - Supporting dyslexic adults--a need for clarity (and more research): a critical
      review of the Rice report 'Developmental Dyslexia in Adults: A Research Review'.
PG  - 68-79
AB  - Evidence based teaching methods are desirable not only for economic efficiency
      but also important for ensuring the learner is engaged in meaningful activity.
      Therefore, a review of the research that could inform both teaching practice and 
      future research is to be welcomed. However, the NRDC review 'Developmental
      Dyslexia in Adults: A Research Review' contains so many methodological flaws,
      including the highly selective way in which the research has been used, that the 
      overall value of the report is questionable. In this paper the authors have
      attempted to highlight the main issues of why this report appears to fall short
      of being a full 'Research Review'.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia in Norwegian: evidence from single-case studies.
PG  - 30-50
AB  - This study provides detailed descriptions of the reading impairments in four
      10-year-old Norwegian children with dyslexia. In all four cases reading
      comprehension was well in advance of the children's slow and inaccurate
      word-recognition skills. Phonological decoding (as assessed by pseudohomophone
      and nonword reading) appeared relatively unimpaired in three of the dyslexic
      cases, both in terms of speed and accuracy. However, reading errors showed that
      these children had particular difficulties with both phoneme length and phoneme
      quality awareness in reading. A 'phonemic identification deficit' account for
      developmental dyslexia in Norwegian children is suggested.

TI  - Linkage analyses of IQ in the collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism
      (COGA) sample.
PG  - 77-86
AB  - Intelligence, as measured by standardized psychological tests, has been shown to 
      be highly heritable, though identifying specific genes influencing general
      intelligence has proven difficult. We conducted genome-wide linkage analyses to
      identify chromosomal regions containing genes influencing intelligence, as
      measured by WAIS full-scale IQ (FSIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and verbal IQ (VIQ). 
      Non-parametric multipoint linkage analyses were conducted with Merlin-regress
      software, using a sample of 1,111 genotyped and phenotyped individuals from 201
      families, ascertained as part of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of
      Alcoholism (COGA). The strongest evidence of linkage was obtained for FSIQ on
      chromosome 6 (LOD=3.28, 12 cM) near the marker D6S1006. This region was also
      implicated with suggestive linkage in a recently published genome screen of IQ in
      Australian and Dutch twin pairs, and it has been implicated in linkage studies of
      developmental dyslexia. Our findings provide further support that chromosome 6p
      contains gene(s) affecting intelligence.

AB  - We review the development and current status of theories of the organisation and 
      representation of conceptual knowledge in the human brain. The currently known
      facts from optic aphasia, category-specific semantic deficits, and functional
      neuroimaging are consistent with a framework in which the first-order constraint 
      on the organisation of conceptual knowledge is domain. Data from functional
      neuroimaging suggests additionally a framework characterised by both domain- and 
      modality-specific constraints. Work in congenital disorders and in apraxia
      indicate that the content of conceptual knowledge is not exhausted by
      modality-specific input/output processes. It is concluded that future empirical
      and theoretical work on the organisation and representation of conceptual
      knowledge will profit from a reorientation of the problem from the organisation
      of distinct processing systems to the content of information represented internal
      to such systems.

TI  - Memory abilities in children with subtypes of dyscalculia.
PG  - 801-18
AB  - This study examines (a) mathematical skills of 2 subgroups of children with
      developmental dyscalculia (DD)--1 group with DD only and a second group with DD
      plus reading disorders (RDD)-and (b) analyzes the memory skills of both groups of
      children. Fifty 11- and 12-year-old children were selected from public schools in
      Guadalajara, Mexico. Seventeen children had DD only, 13 had RDD, and 20 were
      normal controls. Testing included 10 calculation and 6 memory subtests taken from
      the Evaluacion Neuropsicologica Infantil (Matute, Rosselli, Ardila, and Ostrosky,
      in press). Results indicated that children with DD and children with RDD show a
      similar pattern of mathematical impairment. Both subgroups had significantly
      lower scores than the control group in working memory tasks. In addition, the RDD
      group had significantly lower scores than the control group in visual learning
      and semantic memory. Although the RDD group scored lower than the DD group in
      most memory tests, this difference did not reach significance. Working memory
      tests (digits backwards and sentence repetition) appeared to be the best
      predictors of mathematical test scores and may represent a major cognitive defect
      in children with specific defects in mathematics.

PG  - 591-611
AB  - Rapidly accumulating evidence from functional brain imaging studies indicates
      that developmental reading disability is associated with a functional disruption 
      of the brain circuits that normally develop to support reading-related processes.
      This article briefly overviews recent advances in methods that capture the
      anatomical outline and temporal (dynamic) features of regional brain activation
      during performance of reading tasks. One of these methods, magnetoencephalography
      (MEG) or magnetic sources imaging (MSI) is described in more detail in the
      context of investigations of changes in spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity
      associated with improvement in reading skills in response to various types of
      educational interventions.

TI  - Spelling patterns in preadolescents with atypical language skills: phonological, 
      morphological, and orthographic factors.
PG  - 93-123
AB  - Several investigations have considered the spelling abilities of children with
      reading disability; however, the spelling patterns of children with a language
      learning disability (LLD) have been largely ignored. This study examined the
      spelling error patterns of three groups of children who met strict inclusion
      criteria-those with a known LLD (n = 8), chronological-age-matched peers (CA; n =
      8), and a younger spelling-age-matched group (SA; n = 8). An experimental
      spelling measure was specially designed and administered to elucidate the
      underlying linguistic features (clusters, digraphs, etc.) and linguistic
      classifications (phonological, orthographical, morphological) of misspellings.
      Based on inferential statistical analyses, a general pattern was that the LLD
      group and the SA group always differed from the CA group, whereas the LLD group
      performed similarly to the SA group. This finding lends credence to the
      hypothesis that children with an LLD, like children with reading disability, are 
      delayed in spelling development rather than following a deviant developmental
      process. However, a qualitative analysis indicated two specific patterns. First, 
      the LLD group had more trouble than did the SA group in representing the basic
      phonological structure of words, when complexity was increased by word length or 
      linguistic structure. Second, in contrast to the SA group, the LLD group had
      greater omissions of inflected and derived morphological markers. These findings 
      point to the critical role of morphology as the mediator between and form and
      meaning.

TI  - Differences in vulnerability between the hemispheres in early childhood and
      adulthood.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - There are more left hemisphere damaged (LHD) than right hemisphere damaged (RHD) 
      children and adults, if one relies on studies of congenital hemiparesis, as well 
      as on those done on groups with radiologically demonstrated perinatal and
      postnatal unilateral stroke, hemispherectomy or unilateral epilepsy in childhood 
      or adulthood. The main pathogenetic factor seems to be a hemodynamic one,
      responsible for insufficient blood supply to the left hemisphere (LH). Since
      adults show a difference in the same direction as children, the blood supply
      factor to the left internal carotid artery would seem to be the crucial factor.
      Around birth, an open ductus arteriosus may play an additional role. The
      hemodynamic asymmetry does not exclude an intrinsic maturational hemispheric
      tissue factor, making the left hemisphere more vulnerable than the right to
      detrimental influences around birth and during the early postnatal period.
      Immature white matter is especially vulnerable to asphyxia.

AB  - The present study combined parallel data from the Northeast-Northwest
      Collaborative Adoption Projects (N2CAP) and the Western Reserve Reading Project
      (WRRP) to examine sibling similarity and quantitative genetic model estimates for
      measures of reading skills in 272 school-age sibling pairs from three family
      types (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, and unrelated adoptive siblings). The 
      study included measures of letter and word identification, phonological
      awareness, phonological decoding, rapid automatized naming, and general cognitive
      ability. Estimates of additive genetic effects and shared environmental effects
      were moderate and significant. Furthermore, shared environmental effects
      estimated in twins were generally similar in magnitude to adoptive sibling
      correlations, suggesting highly replicable estimates across different study
      designs.

TI  - The double-deficit hypothesis: a comprehensive analysis of the evidence.
PG  - 25-47
AB  - The double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia proposes that deficits in
      phonological processing and naming speed represent independent sources of
      dysfunction in dyslexia. The present article is a review of the evidence for the 
      double-deficit hypothesis, including a discussion of recent findings related to
      the hypothesis. Studies in this area have been characterized by variability in
      methodology--how dyslexia is defined and identified, and how dyslexia subtypes
      are classified. Such variability sets limitations on the extent to which
      conclusions may be drawn with respect to the double-deficit hypothesis.
      Furthermore, the literature is complicated by the persistent finding that
      measures of phonological processing and naming speed are significantly
      correlated, resulting in a statistical artifact that makes it difficult to
      disentangle the influence of naming speed from that of phonological processing.
      Longitudinal and intervention studies of the double-deficit hypothesis are needed
      to accumulate evidence that investigates a naming speed deficit that is
      independent of a phonological deficit for readers with dyslexia. The existing
      evidence does not support a persistent core deficit in naming speed for readers
      with dyslexia.

PG  - 110-3
AB  - PURPOSE: To present and describe the role of the organ of vision in the course of
      developmental dyslexia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of
      contemporary literature about the etiopathogenesis and the clinical symptoms of
      dyslexia was conducted. RESULTS: Developmental dyslexia in other words is the
      specific difficulty of a person with reading and writing caused by a deficit in
      the development of perceptive and motoric functions as well as the coordination
      of these functions. The etiopathogenesis of dyslexia is not definitely
      determined. Currently developmental dyslexia is thought to be determined by
      environmental and genetic factors. In accessible literature it is noted that a
      total of 5-17.5% of all people is effected by dyslexia. It is widely regarded
      that 63% of all sufferers of dyslexia develop the auditory type of dyslexia with 
      an additional 9% having the visual type of dyslexia, while the rest develop a
      mixed type. The basis of visual dyslexia lies in the disorder of visual
      perception linked to the disorders of visual and motoric coordination as well as 
      visual and spatial integration. People with developmental dyslexia tend to evolve
      numerous changes in the magnocellular pathway, eyeball movements, accommodation
      as well as binocular vision.

TI  - The genetic basis of hair whorl, handedness, and other phenotypes.
PG  - 708-14
AB  - Evidence is presented that RHD, RHCE, and other RH genes, may be interesting
      candidates to consider when searching for the genetic basis of hair whorl
      rotation (i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise), handedness (i.e., right handed,
      left handed or ambidextrous), speech laterality (i.e., right brained or left
      brained), speech dyslexia (e.g., stuttering), sexual orientation (i.e.,
      heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or transsexual), schizophrenia, bipolar
      disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Such evidence involves the need for a
      genetic model that includes maternal immunization to explain some of the
      empirical results reported in the literature. The complex polymorphisms present
      among the maternally immunizing RH genes can then be used to explain other
      empirical results. Easily tested hypotheses are suggested, based upon genotypic
      (but not phenotypic) frequencies of the RH genes. In particular, homozygous
      dominant individuals are expected to be less common or lacking entirely among the
      alternative phenotypes. If it is proven that RH genes are involved in brain
      architecture, it will have a profound effect upon our understanding of the
      development and organization of the asymmetrical vertebrate brain and may
      eventually lead to a better understanding of the developmental processes which
      occur to produce the various alternative phenotypes discussed here. In addition, 
      if RH genes are shown to be involved in the production of these phenotypes, then 
      the evolutionary studies can be performed to demonstrate the beneficial effect of
      the recessive alleles of RHD and RHCE, and why human evolution appears to be
      selecting for the recessive alleles even though an increase in the frequency of
      such alleles may imply lower average fecundity among some individuals possessing 
      them.

TI  - Left lateralized white matter microstructure accounts for individual differences 
      in reading ability and disability.
PG  - 2178-88
AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to investigate the association between
      variation in white matter microstructure and individual differences in reading
      skill within children. Unlike previous DTI studies of reading, our sample
      examined children in both the average reading range as well as several children
      in the performance range of reading disability (RD). Results replicate previous
      findings of a strong correlation between fractional anisotropy (FA) values in a
      left temporo-parietal white matter region and standardized reading scores of
      typically developing children. Furthermore, FA values in this same region
      accounted for differences between children scoring in the average range and
      children scoring in the RD range, suggesting that the role of white matter tract 
      microstructure is best characterized as an extreme range on a continuum of
      typical variation. Furthermore, significant correlations between working memory
      and frontal white matter tract regions were present in this same population, yet 
      were demonstrated to be independent of the relationships found between reading
      and more posterior regions. Results form a "correlational double dissociation"
      that demonstrates domain specificity in the influence of white matter tract
      structures to individual differences in cognitive performance.

TI  - Bias in magnitude estimation following left hemisphere injury.
PG  - 1406-12
AB  - There is a growing interest both in identifying the neural mechanisms of
      magnitude estimation and in identifying forms of bias that can explain aspects of
      behavioral syndromes like unilateral neglect. Magnitude estimation is associated 
      with activation of temporo-parietal cortex in both cerebral hemispheres of normal
      subjects; however, it is unclear if and how left hemisphere lesions bias
      magnitude estimation because the infrequency of neglect and the presence of
      aphasia in these subjects confound examination. In contrast, we examined
      magnitude estimation using 12 different types of sensory stimuli that spanned
      five sensory domains in two patients with very different clinical presentations
      following unilateral left hemisphere stroke. One patient had neglect sub-acutely 
      without aphasia. The other had aphasia chronically after a temporo-parietal
      lesion but not neglect. The neglect patient was re-examined 48 h after being
      treated with modafinil (Provigil) for decreased arousal. Both patients
      demonstrated bias in magnitude estimation relative to normal subjects (n=83).
      Alertness improved in the neglect patient after taking modafinil. His neglect
      also resolved and his magnitude estimates more closely resembled those of normal 
      subjects. This is the first evidence, to our knowledge, that left hemisphere
      injury can bias magnitude estimation in a manner similar but not identical to
      that associated with right hemisphere injury.

TI  - Dyslexics are impaired on implicit higher-order sequence learning, but not on
      implicit spatial context learning.
PG  - 1131-44
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by poor reading ability and impairments
      on a range of tasks including phonological processing and processing of sensory
      information. Some recent studies have found deficits in implicit sequence
      learning using the serial reaction time task, but others have not. Other skills, 
      such as global visuo-spatial processing may even be enhanced in dyslexics,
      although deficits have also been noted. The present study compared dyslexic and
      non-dyslexic college students on two implicit learning tasks, an alternating
      serial response time task in which sequential dependencies exist across
      non-adjacent elements and a spatial context learning task in which the global
      configuration of a display cues the location of a search target. Previous
      evidence indicates that these implicit learning tasks are based on different
      underlying brain systems, fronto-striatal-cerebellar circuits for sequence
      learning and medial temporal lobe for spatial context learning. Results revealed 
      a double dissociation: dyslexics showed impaired sequence learning, but superior 
      spatial context learning. Consistent with this group difference, there was a
      significant positive correlation between reading ability (single real and
      non-word reading) and sequence learning, but a significant negative correlation
      between these measures and spatial context learning. Tests of explicit knowledge 
      confirmed that learning was implicit for both groups on both tasks. These
      findings indicate that dyslexic college students are impaired on some kinds of
      implicit learning, but not on others. The specific nature of their learning
      deficit is consistent with reports of physiological and anatomical differences
      for individuals with dyslexia in frontal and cerebellar structures.

TI  - Implicit motor learning deficits in dyslexic adults.
PG  - 795-8
AB  - Children with developmental dyslexia fail to develop age-appropriate reading
      skills despite adequate intelligence and education. It has been suggested that
      dyslexics' various literacy, sensory and motor difficulties may be related to
      impaired cerebellar function. As the cerebellum is involved in motor learning, we
      measured serial reaction time performance in 40 adults (21 controls, 19
      dyslexics). Dyslexic subjects performed comparably to controls during the
      randomly-ordered reaction time blocks, indicating that the dyslexics were as able
      as controls to make appropriate stimulus-response associations. However, the
      dyslexics failed to show the reaction time reduction that the control group
      showed during the repeated sequences (p = 0.018) and there was a significant
      group by condition effect when comparing the last two blocks of the sequence
      condition with the first two blocks of the final random condition (p = 0.008).
      Furthermore, there was a significant difference between good and poor readers on 
      the degree of learning during the task (p = 0.015). This suggests that some
      dyslexics may suffer from an implicit motor learning deficit, which could
      generalize to non-motor learning.

TI  - Reduced auditory M100 asymmetry in schizophrenia and dyslexia: applying a
      developmental instability approach to assess atypical brain asymmetry.
PG  - 289-99
AB  - Although atypical structural and functional superior temporal gyrus (STG)
      asymmetries are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia and
      individuals with dyslexia, their significance is unclear. One possibility is that
      atypical asymmetries reflect a general risk factor that can be seen across
      multiple neurodevelopmental conditions--a risk factor whose origins are best
      understood in the context of Developmental Instability (DI) theory. DI measures
      (minor physical anomalies (MPAs) and fluctuating asymmetries (FAs)) reflect
      perturbation of the genetic plan. The present study sought to assess whether the 
      presence of peripheral indices of DI predicts anomalous functional auditory
      cortex asymmetry in schizophrenia patients and dyslexia subjects. The location of
      the auditory M100 response was used as a measure of functional STG asymmetry, as 
      it has been reported that in controls (but not in subjects with schizophrenia or 
      dyslexia) the M100 source location in the right hemisphere is shifted anterior to
      that seen for the left hemisphere. Whole-brain auditory evoked magnetic field
      data were successfully recorded from 14 male schizophrenia patients, 21 male
      subjects with dyslexia, and 16 normal male control subjects. MPA and FA measures 
      were also obtained. Replicating previous studies, both schizophrenia and dyslexia
      groups showed less M100 asymmetry than did controls. Schizophrenia and dyslexia
      subjects also had higher MPA scores than normal controls. Although neither total 
      MPA nor FA measures predicted M100 asymmetry, analyses on individual MPA items
      revealed a relationship between high palate and M100 asymmetry. Findings suggest 
      that M100 positional asymmetry is not a diagnostically specific feature in
      several neurodevelopmental conditions. Continued research examining DI and brain 
      asymmetry relationships is warranted.

TI  - Treatment of developmental dyslexia: a review.
PG  - 3-13
AB  - Remarkably few research articles on the treatment of developmental dyslexia were 
      published during the last 25 years. Some treatment research arose from the
      temporal processing theory, some from the phonological deficit hypothesis and
      some more from the balance model of learning to read and dyslexia. Within the
      framework of that model, this article reviews the aetiology of dyslexia
      sub-types, the neuropsychological rationale for treatment, the treatment
      techniques and the outcomes of treatment research. The possible mechanisms
      underlying the effects of treatment are discussed.

TI  - Dyslexia--a molecular disorder of neuronal migration: the 2004 Norman Geschwind
      Memorial Lecture.
PG  - 151-65
AB  - For 25 years now, there has been a serious attempt to get at the fundamental
      cause(s) of dyslexia in our laboratory. A great deal of research has been carried
      out on the psychological and brain underpinnings of the linguistic dysfunctions
      seen in dyslexia, but attempts to get at its cause have been limited. Initially, 
      observations were made on the brains of persons with dyslexia who had died and
      their brains donated for research. These observations were modeled in animal
      models in order to better understand the full extent of anatomical and
      developmental brain characteristics. More recently, models have begun to employ
      genetic manipulations in order to close the gap between genes, brain, and
      behavior. In this article based on a lecture given in memory of Dr. Norman
      Geschwind to the International Dyslexia Association assembly in Philadelphia in
      2004, I outline the history of the research leading up to the most recent
      findings. These findings consist of experiments using methods that interfere with
      the function of DNA, using as constructs genes that have been implicated in
      dyslexia, which cause developmental problems of neuronal migration in rats,
      secondary brain changes in response to the migration problems, and abnormal
      processing of sounds.

TI  - Mental rotation of letters, pictures, and three-dimensional objects in German
      dyslexic children.
PG  - 497-512
AB  - This study examines mental rotation ability in children with developmental
      dyslexia. Prior investigations have yielded equivocal results that might be due
      to differences in stimulus material and testing formats employed. Whereas some
      investigators found dyslexic readers to be impaired in mental rotation, others
      did not report any performance differences or even superior spatial performance
      for dyslexia. Here, we report a comparison of mental rotation for letters,
      three-dimensional figures sensu Shepard and Metzler, and colored pictures of
      animals or humans in second-grade German dyslexic readers. Findings indicate that
      dyslexic readers are impaired in mental rotation for all three kinds of stimuli. 
      Effects of general intelligence were controlled. Furthermore, dyslexic children
      were deficient in other spatial abilities like identifying letters or forms among
      distracters. These results are discussed with respect to the hypotheses of a
      developmental dysfunction of the parietal cortex or a subtle anomaly in
      cerebellar function in dyslexic readers.

TI  - Impaired balancing ability in dyslexic children.
PG  - 370-80
AB  - Children with developmental dyslexia struggle to learn to read and spell despite 
      adequate intelligence and educational opportunity. Several lines of research are 
      attempting to establish the neurobiological basis of dyslexia, and low-level
      sensory and motor deficits have been found in dyslexic populations; furthermore, 
      behavioural and imaging data point to cerebellar dysfunction in dyslexia. To
      investigate this, normal readers (n=19) and children with developmental dyslexia 
      (n=16) were asked to perform various cognitive, literacy, and balancing tasks.
      Children balanced on the left or right foot, with eyes open or closed, for a
      period of 10 s during which their movements were recorded with a motion-tracking 
      system. Dyslexic children were less stable than the control children in both
      eyes-open conditions (left foot P=0.02, right foot P=0.012). While there were no 
      group differences during the eyes-closed conditions, the dyslexic children
      dropped a foot to correct balance significantly more often than control children 
      (P<0.05). Incidence analysis showed that 50% of the dyslexic group fell into the 
      'impaired' category on the eyes-open balancing tasks; when the mean balancing
      scores and the foot drops were considered, only three of our dyslexic children
      showed no evidence of balancing difficulties. There were strong correlations
      between reading and spelling scores and the mean eyes-open balancing score
      (r=0.52 and 0.44, respectively). Thus, while not all children with developmental 
      dyslexia show impaired balancing skills, low-level motor dysfunction may be
      associated with impaired literacy development. This could be due to several
      factors, including the involvement of the cerebellum, the magnocellular system,
      or more general developmental immaturity.

TI  - Are specific language impairment and dyslexia distinct disorders?
PG  - 1378-96
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether specific language
      impairment (SLI) and dyslexia are distinct developmental disorders. METHOD: Study
      1 investigated the overlap between SLI identified in kindergarten and dyslexia
      identified in 2nd, 4th, or 8th grades in a representative sample of 527 children.
      Study 2 examined phonological processing in a subsample of participants,
      including 21 children with dyslexia only, 43 children with SLI only, 18 children 
      with SLI and dyslexia, and 165 children with typical language/reading
      development. Measures of phonological awareness and nonword repetition were
      considered. RESULTS: Study 1 showed limited but statistically significant overlap
      between SLI and dyslexia. Study 2 found that children with dyslexia or a
      combination of dyslexia and SLI performed significantly less well on measures of 
      phonological processing than did children with SLI only and those with typical
      development. Children with SLI only showed only mild deficits in phonological
      processing compared with typical children. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the
      view that SLI and dyslexia are distinct but potentially comorbid developmental
      language disorders. A deficit in phonological processing is closely associated
      with dyslexia but not with SLI when it occurs in the absence of dyslexia.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia in a regular orthography: a single case study.
PG  - 433-40
AB  - This study of an adult case examined in detail with eye movement measures the
      reading speed problem which is characteristic for developmental dyslexia in
      regular orthographies. A dramatic length effect was found for low frequency words
      and for pseudowords, but not for high frequency words. However, even for high
      frequency words it was found that reading times were substantially prolonged
      although number of fixations did not differ. A neurocognitive assessment revealed
      no visual deficits (parallel processing, precedence detection, coherent motion
      detection) but speed impairments for certain verbal and phonological processes.
      We propose that the reading difficulties are phonological in nature, but these
      difficulties become manifest as inefficiency and not as inability.

TI  - Dystonic rabbit syndrome from citalopram.
PG  - 289-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two cases are described of dystonic rabbit syndrome induced by
      citalopram. This syndrome is a movement disorder with a 5-Hz rhythmic vertical
      motion of the mouth and lips without involvement of the tongue. METHOD: The
      patients were interviewed and examined, and additional history was taken from the
      medical records. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction rating scale was applied.
      Relevant literature was reviewed. RESULTS: Two patients developed dystonic rabbit
      syndrome soon after starting escitalopram 10 mg/day or citalopram 5 mg/day.
      Neither patient had any past or current exposure to a dopamine-blocking drug or
      any history of movement disorder. [Es]citalopram discontinuation led to
      disappearance of the movement disorder. The Naranjo scale indicates high
      probability of dystonic rabbit syndrome from citalopram. CONCLUSION: Citalopram
      can rapidly induce dystonic rabbit syndrome. This effect suggests that for some
      patients citalopram has neuropsychiatric effects similar to those of a
      dopamine-blocking antipsychotic drug. This might be of concern with patients who 
      cannot communicate well (eg, young children; patients with dementia,
      developmental disabilities, or aphasia).

TI  - The subtypes of developmental dyslexia in Chinese: evidence from three cases.
PG  - 311-29
AB  - This study investigated subtypes of developmental dyslexia in Chinese by
      assessing three cases of Chinese dyslexic children. A battery of screening
      measures, a character naming and meaning task, and metalinguistic awareness tasks
      were administered to each child. One of the three children demonstrated
      characteristics of developmental surface dyslexia, and the other two showed
      characteristics of developmental deep dyslexia. Moreover, the children's reading 
      problems were found to be specifically related to their deficits in
      metalinguistic awareness. The dissociation between developmental surface and deep
      dyslexia provides support to Weekes et al.'s (Neurocase 1997; 3: 51-60) model
      that a semantic and a nonsemantic pathway exist independently in Chinese reading.
      The results also suggest that deficits in morphological and phonological
      awareness may cause developmental delays in the semantic and the nonsemantic
      pathway.

TI  - Do Chinese dyslexic children have difficulties learning English as a second
      language?
PG  - 603-18
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine whether Chinese dyslexic children had
      difficulties learning English as a second language given the distinctive
      characteristics of the two scripts. Twenty-five Chinese primary school children
      with developmental dyslexia and 25 normally achieving children were tested on a
      number of English vocabulary, reading, and phonological processing tasks. It was 
      found that the Dyslexia group performed significantly worse than the Control
      group in nearly all the English measures. The findings suggest that Chinese
      dyslexic children also encounter difficulties in learning English as a second
      language, and they are generally weak in phonological processing both in Chinese 
      and English. However, phonological skills were found to correlate significantly
      with English reading but not with Chinese reading in the dyslexic children. It is
      evident that there are both common and specific causes to reading difficulties in
      Chinese and English.

TI  - Genetic influences on language impairment and phonological short-term memory.
PG  - 528-34
AB  - It has been known for some years that specific language impairment (SLI), an
      unexpected failure to acquire age-appropriate language skills, is highly
      heritable. However, molecular genetic studies have been hampered by the
      heterogeneity of the disorder and the predominant lack of clear
      genotype-phenotype relationships. We review recent studies suggesting that a
      better understanding of the genetics of SLI might emerge if we move away from
      clinical criteria for diagnosis to look instead at a theoretically based
      quantitative and cognitive measure of the phenotype: a test of phonological
      short-term memory (STM). Deficient phonological STM has been linked to specific
      genetic loci, and might play a role in determining some types of reading
      impairment as well as SLI. Identifying those cognitive deficits that work best as
      indices of heritable phenotypes will help us to uncover the aetiology of
      developmental disorders.

      These results suggest that children with developmental dyslexia present selective

TI  - Brain abnormalities underlying altered activation in dyslexia: a voxel based
      morphometry study.
PG  - 2453-61
AB  - Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess the consistency among functional
      imaging and brain morphometry data in developmental dyslexia. Subjects, from
      three different cultural contexts (UK, France and Italy), were the same as those 
      described in a previous PET activation paper, which revealed a common pattern of 
      reduced activation during reading tasks in the left temporal and occipital lobes.
      We provide evidence that altered activation observed within the reading system is
      associated with altered density of grey and white matter of specific brain
      regions, such as the left middle and inferior temporal gyri and the left arcuate 
      fasciculus. This supports the view that dyslexia is associated with both local
      grey matter dysfunction and with altered connectivity among phonological/reading 
      areas. The differences were replicable across samples confirming that the
      neurological disorder underlying dyslexia is the same across the cultures
      investigated in the study.

TI  - Auditory evoked potential patterns to voiced and voiceless speech sounds in adult
      developmental dyslexics with persistent deficits.
PG  - 1524-34
AB  - Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded from eight developmental dyslexic
      adults with persistent reading, spelling and phonological deficits, and 10
      non-dyslexic controls to voiced (/ba/) and voiceless (/pa/) consonant-vowel
      syllables. Consistent with previous data, non-dyslexics coded these stimuli
      differentially according to the temporal cues that form the basis of the
      voiced/voiceless contrast: AEPs had time-locked components with latencies that
      were determined by the temporal structure of the stimuli. Dyslexics were
      characterized by one of two electrophysiological patterns: AEP pattern I
      dyslexics demonstrated a differential coding of stimuli on the basis of some
      temporal cues, but with an atypically large number of components and a
      considerable delay in AEP termination time; AEP pattern II dyslexics demonstrated
      no clear differential coding of stimuli on the basis of temporal cues. These data
      reveal the presence of anomalies in cortical auditory processing which could
      underlie persistent perceptual and linguistic impairments in some developmental
      dyslexics. Furthermore, scalp AEP distribution maps showing the difference
      observed between /ba/ and /pa/ activity over time suggest that the regions
      implicated in the processing of crucial time-related acoustic cues were not
      systematically lateralized to the left hemisphere like they were for
      non-dyslexics. These findings may be conducive to a better understanding and
      treatment of perceptual dysfunctions in developmental language disorders.

PG  - 370-8
AB  - What are the cognitive and neurobiological building blocks necessary for children
      to acquire literacy, a skill that is crucial for academic and life achievement?
      In this review we discuss the behavioral and neurobiological evidence concerning 
      the bases of reading development and impairment. The means by which reading
      achievement may be influenced by the background and experiences that a child
      brings to the classroom are discussed. Finally, we review a series of
      experimental studies that have examined the cognitive and neurobiological
      response prior to and following reading intervention in struggling readers. The
      importance of appropriate control groups is stressed, as well as the ultimate
      goal of designing reading interventions that target individual needs.

TI  - The axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1 is a candidate gene for developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - e50
AB  - Dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is the most common learning disorder
      with a complex, partially genetic basis, but its biochemical mechanisms remain
      poorly understood. A locus on Chromosome 3, DYX5, has been linked to dyslexia in 
      one large family and speech-sound disorder in a subset of small families. We
      found that the axon guidance receptor gene ROBO1, orthologous to the Drosophila
      roundabout gene, is disrupted by a chromosome translocation in a dyslexic
      individual. In a large pedigree with 21 dyslexic individuals genetically linked
      to a specific haplotype of ROBO1 (not found in any other chromosomes in our
      samples), the expression of ROBO1 from this haplotype was absent or attenuated in
      affected individuals. Sequencing of ROBO1 in apes revealed multiple coding
      differences, and the selection pressure was significantly different between the
      human, chimpanzee, and gorilla branch as compared to orangutan. We also
      identified novel exons and splice variants of ROBO1 that may explain the apparent
      phenotypic differences between human and mouse in heterozygous loss of ROBO1. We 
      conclude that dyslexia may be caused by partial haplo-insufficiency for ROBO1 in 
      rare families. Thus, our data suggest that a slight disturbance in neuronal axon 
      crossing across the midline between brain hemispheres, dendrite guidance, or
      another function of ROBO1 may manifest as a specific reading disability in
      humans.

TI  - Auditory and visual refractory period effects in children and adults: an ERP
      study.
PG  - 2184-203
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This developmental study was designed to investigate event-related
      potential (ERP) refractory period effects in the auditory and visual modalities
      in children and adults and to correlate these electrophysiological measures with 
      standard behavioral measures. METHODS: ERPs, accuracy, and reaction time were
      recorded as school-age children and adults monitored a stream of repetitive
      standard stimuli and detected occasional targets. Standards were presented at
      various interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in order to measure refractory period
      effects on early sensory components. RESULTS: As has been reported previously in 
      adults, larger components for standards with longer ISIs were observed for an
      auditory N1 and the visual occipital P1 and P2 in adults. Remarkably similar
      effects were observed in children. However, only children showed refractory
      effects on the amplitude of the visual N1 and P2 measured at anterior sites.
      Across groups, behavioral accuracy and reaction time were correlated with
      latencies of auditory N1 and visual P2 across ISI conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results establish a normal course of development for auditory and visual ERP
      refractory period effects across the 6- to 8-year-old age range and indicate
      similar refractoriness in the neural systems indexed by ERPs in these paradigms
      in typically developing children and adults. Further, the results suggest that
      electrophysiological measures and standard behavioral measures may at least in
      part index similar processing in the present paradigms. SIGNIFICANCE: These
      findings provide a foundation for further investigation into atypical
      development, particularly in those populations for which processing time deficits
      have been implicated such as children with specific language impairment or
      dyslexia.

      normal intelligence, although there have been associated findings of learning
      disabilities, namely, dyslexia. Two genes responsible for PH have been
      identified: FilaminA, which encodes for the protein filamin A, and ARFGEF2, which
      encodes for the vesical transport-regulating protein ARFGEF2. The much more
      common X-linked dominant form of this disorder is due to filamin A, affects
      females, and is typically lethal in males. A much rarer autosomal recessive form 
      due to ARFGEF2 mutations leads to microcephaly and developmental delay in
      addition to PH. Cell motility, adhesion defects, and weakening along the
      neuroepithelial lining may result from defects in these genes during cortical
      development and contribute to PH, but the mechanisms are not clear yet. Treatment
      of PH is largely symptomatic, following basic principles for epilepsy management 
      and genetic counseling.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to assess proprioception anomalies in
      postural deficiency syndrome in a group of children suffering from reading
      impairment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty male patients with an average age of 11
      years and 9 months were included in the study. Initially, they were given a
      standardized neuropsychological examination, which confirmed the diagnosis of
      reading impairment. Then after filling out a questionnaire seeking a
      proprioceptive anomaly, the patients were subjected to a clinical ocular and
      postural examination consisting of nine precisely described steps. RESULTS: All
      of the patients recruited for the study presented clinical signs confirming a
      proprioception disorder found as a part of postural deficiency syndrome.
      CONCLUSION: This study opens a new direction for research concerning the origin
      and treatment of at least some reading-impaired children.

AB  - This article reports on a study of children's narratives about the relationships 
      between dyslexia and being teased at school and explores the dynamics between
      dyslexia, being bullied, self-esteem, and psychosocial problems. We reconstructed
      four profiles of inner logic in the children's reactions to being teased or
      humiliated as a consequence of their dyslexia. Most children with dyslexia
      protect themselves against teasing and feeling worthless by concealing both their
      emotions and their academic failures. Others, however, concentrate on their
      academic progress, and their self-esteem seems to be strengthened by fighting
      against dyslexia.

TI  - Dorsal stream deficits suggest hidden dyslexia among deaf poor readers:
      correlated evidence from reduced perceptual speed and elevated coherent motion
      detection thresholds.
PG  - 300-11
AB  - Prelingual deafness and developmental dyslexia have confounding developmental
      effects on reading acquisition. Therefore, standard reading assessment methods
      for diagnosing dyslexia in hearing people are ineffective for use with deaf
      people. Recently, Samar, Parasnis, and Berent (2002) reported visual evoked
      potential evidence that deaf poor readers, compared to deaf good readers, have
      dorsal stream visual system deficits like those previously found for hearing
      dyslexics. Here, we report new psychometric and psychophysical evidence that
      deficits in dorsal stream function, likely involving extrastriate area MT, are
      associated with relatively poor reading comprehension in deaf adults. Poorer
      reading comprehension within a group of 23 prelingually deaf adults was
      associated with lower scores on the Symbol Digit Modality Test, a perceptual
      speed test commonly used to help identify dyslexia in hearing people.
      Furthermore, coherent dot motion detection thresholds, which reflect the
      functional status of area MT, correlated negatively with reading scores in each
      visual quadrant. Elevated motion thresholds for deaf poor readers were not due to
      general cognitive differences in IQ but were specifically correlated with poor
      perceptual speed. With IQ controlled, a highly reliable right visual field
      advantage for coherent motion detection was found. Additional analyses suggested 
      that the functional status of dorsal stream motion detection mechanisms in deaf
      people is related to reading comprehension, but the direction and strength of
      lateralization of those mechanisms is independent of reading comprehension. Our
      results generally imply that dyslexia is a hidden contributor to relatively poor 
      reading skill within the deaf population and that assessment of dorsal stream
      function may provide a diagnostic biological marker for dyslexia in deaf people.

TI  - Phonological oddballs in the focus of attention elicit a normal P3b in dyslexic
      adults.
PG  - 467-75
AB  - Difficulties in phonological processing have been proposed to be the core symptom
      of developmental dyslexia. Phoneme awareness tasks have been shown to both index 
      and predict individual reading ability. In a previous experiment, we observed
      that dyslexic adults fail to display a P3a modulation for phonological deviants
      within an alliterated word stream when concentrating primarily on a lexical
      decision task [Fosker and Thierry, 2004, Neurosci. Lett. 357, 171-174]. Here we
      recorded the P3b oddball response elicited by initial phonemes within streams of 
      alliterated words and pseudo-words when participants focussed directly on
      detecting the oddball phonemes. Despite significant verbal screening test
      differences between dyslexic adults and controls, the error rates, reactions
      times, and main components (P2, N2, P3a, and P3b) were indistinguishable across
      groups. The only difference between groups was found in the N1 range, where
      dyslexic participants failed to show the modulations induced by phonological
      pairings (/b/-/p/ versus /r/-/g/) in controls. In light of previous P3a
      differences, these results suggest an important role for attention allocation in 
      the manifestation of phonological deficits in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Measurement error: Implications for diagnosis and discrepancy models of
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 186-202
AB  - The diagnosis of developmental dyslexia (DD) is reliant on a discrepancy between 
      intellectual functioning and reading achievement. Discrepancy-based formulae have
      frequently been employed to establish the significance of the difference between 
      'intelligence' and 'actual' reading achievement. These formulae, however, often
      fail to take into consideration test reliability and the error associated with a 
      single test score. This paper provides an illustration of the potential effects
      that test reliability and measurement error can have on the diagnosis of
      dyslexia, with particular reference to discrepancy models. The roles of
      reliability and standard error of measurement (SEM) in classic test theory are
      also briefly reviewed. This is followed by illustrations of how SEM and test
      reliability can aid with the interpretation of a simple discrepancy-based formula
      of DD. It is proposed that a lack of consideration of test theory in the use of
      discrepancy-based models of DD can lead to misdiagnosis (both false positives and
      false negatives). Further, misdiagnosis in research samples affects
      reproducibility and generalizability of findings. This in turn, may explain
      current inconsistencies in research on the perceptual, sensory, and motor
      correlates of dyslexia.

TI  - The effect of print size on reading speed in dyslexia.
PG  - 332-349
AB  - This article details a study which predicted that across a wide range of print
      sizes dyslexic reading would follow the same curve shape as skilled reading, with
      constant reading rates across large print sizes and a sharp decline in reading
      rates below a critical print size. It also predicted that dyslexic readers would 
      require larger critical print sizes to attain their maximum reading speeds,
      following the letter position coding deficit hypothesis. Reading speed was
      measured across twelve print sizes ranging from Snellen equivalents of 20/12 to
      20/200 letter sizes for a group of dyslexic readers in Grades 2 to 4 (aged 7 to
      10 years), and for non-dyslexic readers in Grades 1 to 3 (aged 6 to 8 years). The
      groups were equated for word reading ability. Results confirmed that reading
      rate-by-print size curves followed the same two-limbed shape for dyslexic and
      non-dyslexic readers. Dyslexic reading curves showed higher critical print sizes 
      and shallower reading rate-by-print size slopes below the critical print size,
      consistent with the hypothesis of a letter-position coding deficit. Non-dyslexic 
      reading curves also showed a decrease of critical print size with age. A
      developmental lag model of dyslexic reading does not account for the results,
      since the regression of critical print size on maximum reading rate differed
      between groups.

TI  - Accuracy and speed of orthographic processing in persons with developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 95-107
AB  - A group of 39 persons (20 male and 19 female, 11.0 to 32.5 yr.) with
      developmental dyslexia and 42 controls (21 male and 21 female, 11.2 to 32.3
      years) were compared on computerized tests of sight word reading, nonword
      decoding, and spelling recognition. The subjects with developmental dyslexia
      performed significantly slower and less accurately than controls on all tasks.
      Further, the effect size of the group differences was larger for the older group.
      Within-group analyses showed a significant difference by age group on accuracy.
      Only the control group showed a significant age difference between groups on
      response time. Mean accuracy and response times for the reading-disabled subjects
      resembled shifted versions of the control group means. These results agree with
      previous reports that phonological deficits persist for reading-disabled adults
      and suggest a test of whether the discrepancy between reading-disabled and
      typically achieving readers may actually increase across age groups.

TI  - A genome scan in multigenerational families with dyslexia: Identification of a
      novel locus on chromosome 2q that contributes to phonological decoding
      efficiency.
PG  - 699-711
AB  - Dyslexia is a common and complex developmental disorder manifested by unexpected 
      difficulty in learning to read. Multiple different measures are used for
      diagnosis, and may reflect different biological pathways related to the disorder.
      Impaired phonological decoding (translation of written words without meaning cues
      into spoken words) is thought to be a core deficit. We present a genome scan of
      two continuous measures of phonological decoding ability: phonemic decoding
      efficiency (PDE) and word attack (WA). PDE measures both accuracy and speed of
      phonological decoding, whereas WA measures accuracy alone. Multipoint variance
      component linkage analyses (VC) and Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) multipoint
      joint linkage and segregation analyses were performed on 108 families. A strong
      signal was observed on chromosome 2 for PDE using both VC (LOD=2.65) and MCMC
      methods (intensity ratio (IR)=32.1). The IR is an estimate of the ratio of the
      posterior to prior probability of linkage in MCMC analysis. The chromosome 2
      signal was not seen for WA. More detailed mapping with additional markers
      provided statistically significant evidence for linkage of PDE to chromosome 2,
      with VC-LOD=3.0 and IR=59.6 at D2S1399. Parametric analyses of PDE, using a model
      obtained by complex segregation analysis, provided a multipoint maximum LOD=2.89.
      The consistency of results from three analytic approaches provides strong
      evidence for a locus on chromosome 2 that influences speed but not accuracy of
      phonological decoding.

TI  - Deficits in perceptual noise exclusion in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 862-3
AB  - We evaluated signal-noise discrimination in children with and without dyslexia,
      using magnocellular and parvocellular visual stimuli presented either with or
      without high noise. Dyslexic children had elevated contrast thresholds when
      stimuli of either type were presented in high noise, but performed as well as
      non-dyslexic children when either type was displayed without noise. Our findings 
      suggest that deficits in noise exclusion, not magnocellular processing,
      contribute to the etiology of dyslexia.

TI  - Generalist genes and learning disabilities.
PG  - 592-617
AB  - The authors reviewed recent quantitative genetic research on learning
      disabilities that led to the conclusion that genetic diagnoses differ from
      traditional diagnoses in that the effects of relevant genes are largely general
      rather than specific. This research suggests that most genes associated with
      common learning disabilities--language impairment, reading disability, and
      mathematics disability--are generalists in 3 ways. First, genes that affect
      common learning disabilities are largely the same genes responsible for normal
      variation in learning abilities. Second, genes that affect any aspect of a
      learning disability affect other aspects of the disability. Third, genes that
      affect one learning disability are also likely to affect other learning
      disabilities. These quantitative genetic findings have far-reaching implications 
      for molecular genetics and neuroscience as well as psychology.

TI  - Identification of FOXP2 truncation as a novel cause of developmental speech and
      language deficits.
PG  - 1074-80
AB  - FOXP2, the first gene to have been implicated in a developmental communication
      disorder, offers a unique entry point into neuromolecular mechanisms influencing 
      human speech and language acquisition. In multiple members of the well-studied KE
      family, a heterozygous missense mutation in FOXP2 causes problems in sequencing
      muscle movements required for articulating speech (developmental verbal
      dyspraxia), accompanied by wider deficits in linguistic and grammatical
      processing. Chromosomal rearrangements involving this locus have also been
      identified. Analyses of FOXP2 coding sequence in typical forms of specific
      language impairment (SLI), autism, and dyslexia have not uncovered any
      etiological variants. However, no previous study has performed mutation screening
      of children with a primary diagnosis of verbal dyspraxia, the most overt feature 
      of the disorder in affected members of the KE family. Here, we report
      investigations of the entire coding region of FOXP2, including alternatively
      spliced exons, in 49 probands affected with verbal dyspraxia. We detected
      variants that alter FOXP2 protein sequence in three probands. One such variant is
      a heterozygous nonsense mutation that yields a dramatically truncated protein
      product and cosegregates with speech and language difficulties in the proband,
      his affected sibling, and their mother. Our discovery of the first nonsense
      mutation in FOXP2 now opens the door for detailed investigations of
      neurodevelopment in people carrying different etiological variants of the gene.
      This endeavor will be crucial for gaining insight into the role of FOXP2 in human
      cognition.

TI  - Word length effect in early reading and in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 369-73
AB  - Vocal reaction times were measured in Italian dyslexics and in proficient readers
      while they read single words. Three groups of control participants (for a total
      of 79) were tested. All were in the first, second or third grade of elementary
      school. Nine third graders with a low level of reading ability when assessed by
      standard reading procedures were also tested. Results indicated that vocal RTs of
      control participants were faster and less sensitive to word length as a function 
      of age; also, there was a particularly marked change between first and second
      graders. Dyslexics' vocal RTs and errors were much worse than those of peer
      control participants and resembled those of first grade controls. It is suggested
      that normal readers in an orthographically transparent language (Italian) adopt a
      lexical strategy quite early in their learning. On the contrary, dyslexics seem
      unable to learn this mode of processing and continue to use a sub-lexical reading
      procedure.

TI  - Impaired cerebellar learning in children with prenatal alcohol exposure: a
      comparative study of eyeblink conditioning in children with ADHD and dyslexia.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - Neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence indicate that the cerebellum is
      particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Recent
      research has shown impairments in eyeblink conditioning in rats following
      binge-like neonatal ethanol exposure. The neural substrates of eyeblink
      conditioning have been localized to the cerebellum and related brainstem
      mechanisms. The present study considered whether heavy prenatal alcohol exposure 
      would result in similar impairments in eyeblink conditioning in children. A
      related purpose was to determine if eyeblink conditioning could discriminate
      between children with prenatal alcohol exposure and children diagnosed with
      attention deficit hyperactive disorder or developmental dyslexia. Fifty-three
      age-matched children [10 prenatal alcohol exposure (FAE), 16 attention deficit
      hyperactive disordered (ADHD), 14 children with dyslexia (DYS), 13 normal
      controls] were assessed on eyeblink conditioning in the delay paradigm. Children 
      in the FAE and DYS groups failed to learn the conditioned response, producing
      longer latencies and poorly timed responses to the conditioning stimulus.
      Children with ADHD were impaired on measures of adaptively timed responses,
      although conditioned responses matched normal controls. The results suggest that 
      children prenatally exposed to alcohol have deficits in cerebellar processing
      similar to those with dyslexia, and that these functional deficits are related to
      disabilities in learning.

TI  - Visual, auditory and cross-modal processing of linguistic and nonlinguistic
      temporal patterns among adult dyslexic readers.
PG  - 93-115
AB  - This study examined visual, auditory, and cross-modal temporal pattern processing
      at the nonlinguistic and sublexical linguistic levels, and the relationships
      between these abilities and decoding skill. The central question addressed
      whether dyslexic readers are impaired in their perception of timing, as assessed 
      by sensitivity to rhythm. Participants were college-level adult dyslexic and
      normal readers. The dyslexic adults evidenced generalized impairment in temporal 
      processing: they were less accurate and slower than normal readers when required 
      to detect the temporal gap that differentiated pairs of patterns. Impairment was 
      greatest when processing visual syllables. Temporal pattern processing correlated
      to decoding ability only among normal readers. It is suggested that
      high-functioning dyslexics may cope with temporal processing problems by adopting
      a predominantly holistic, orthographic strategy when decoding. It is proposed
      that there may be cumulative effects of processing demands from different sources
      including modality, stimulus complexity, and linguistic demands, and that
      combinations of these may interact to impact temporal processing ability.
      Moreover, there may be fundamentally distinct and dissociable temporal processing
      abilities, each of which may be differently linked developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 105-20
AB  - The present study addressed auditory processing in 8-11-year-old children with
      developmental dyslexia by means of event-related brain potentials (ERP). Cortical
      sound reception was evaluated by recording N250 responses to syllables and tones 
      and cortical sound discrimination by analyzing the mismatch negativity (MMN) to
      syllable and tone changes. We found that both cortical sound reception and sound 
      discrimination were impaired in dyslexic children. The analysis of the data
      obtained from two dyslexic subgroups, Dyslexics-1 being impaired in non-word
      reading (or both non-word and frequent word reading) and Dyslexics-2 in frequent 
      word reading but not in non-word reading, revealed that the MMN was specifically 
      diminished in the latter group whereas it was normal-like in Dyslexics-1.
      However, no differences were found between these subgroups in sound reception as 
      indicated by the responses elicited by the standard stimuli. These results show
      that different diagnostic subgroups of dyslexics have different patterns of
      auditory processing deficits as suggested by similarly impaired sound reception
      in both dyslexic groups and the sound-discrimination impairment specific to one
      of the groups.

TI  - The Oxford-Durham study: a randomized, controlled trial of dietary
      supplementation with fatty acids in children with developmental coordination
      disorder.
PG  - 1360-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) affects approximately 5% of
      school-aged children. In addition to the core deficits in motor function, this
      condition is associated commonly with difficulties in learning, behavior, and
      psychosocial adjustment that persist into adulthood. Mounting evidence suggests
      that a relative lack of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to
      related neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders such as dyslexia and
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Given the current lack of effective,
      evidence-based treatment options for DCD, the use of fatty acid supplements
      merits investigation. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial of dietary
      supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, compared with placebo, was 
      conducted with 117 children with DCD (5-12 years of age). Treatment for 3 months 
      in parallel groups was followed by a 1-way crossover from placebo to active
      treatment for an additional 3 months. RESULTS: No effect of treatment on motor
      skills was apparent, but significant improvements for active treatment versus
      placebo were found in reading, spelling, and behavior over 3 months of treatment 
      in parallel groups. After the crossover, similar changes were seen in the
      placebo-active group, whereas children continuing with active treatment
      maintained or improved their progress. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acid supplementation
      may offer a safe efficacious treatment option for educational and behavioral
      problems among children with DCD. Additional work is needed to investigate
      whether our inability to detect any improvement in motor skills reflects the
      measures used and to assess the durability of treatment effects on behavior and
      academic progress.

TI  - Comorbidity in severe developmental language disorders: neuropediatric and
      psychological considerations.
PG  - 471-8
AB  - AIM: To explore possible patterns of comorbidity in children with severe
      developmental language disorders (DLD). METHODS: A retrospective investigation of
      the clinical records of 28 children relating to oral motor and language problems,
      psychological profiles, medical history and EEG findings. RESULTS: 36% of all the
      children had pure expressive language problems, 64% had combined
      expressive-receptive language problems and 57% had additional oral motor
      problems. Girls predominated in expressive-receptive problems, while boys
      predominated in oral motor problems. Children with expressive-receptive disorders
      were over-represented at the lower end of normal full-scale IQ (p = 0.015). Lower
      verbal than non-verbal IQ levels were almost as common as equal levels, but a
      lower non-verbal IQ than verbal IQ was also found. Pre/perinatal problems were
      found in 21%, and heredity for developmental language problems or dyslexia in
      39%. There was a higher proportion of attention and motor problems, EEG
      abnormalities, and epileptic syndromes than in the general population (p <
      0.001). CONCLUSION: In severe DLD, both pure expressive and mixed
      expressive-receptive problems are found, and oral motor problems are common.
      Gender differences regarding symptoms are present. Receptive language ability is 
      associated with the full-scale IQ level. A high proportion of EEG abnormalities
      and epilepsy is found. There is a complex pattern of comorbidity between
      speech-language symptoms, psychological characteristics, heredity and EEG
      findings.

TI  - Strong evidence that KIAA0319 on chromosome 6p is a susceptibility gene for
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 581-91
AB  - Linkage between developmental dyslexia (DD) and chromosome 6p has been replicated
      in a number of independent samples. Recent attempts to identify the gene
      responsible for the linkage have produced inconsistent evidence for association
      of DD with a number of genes in a 575-kb region of chromosome 6p22.2, including
      VMP, DCDC2, KIAA0319, TTRAP, and THEM2. We aimed to identify the specific gene or
      genes involved by performing a systematic, high-density (approximately 2-3-kb
      intervals) linkage disequilibrium screen of these genes in an independent sample,
      incorporating family-based and case-control designs in which dyslexia was defined
      as an extreme representation of reading disability. Using DNA pooling, we first
      observed evidence for association with 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
      13 of which were located in the KIAA0319 gene (P<.01-.003). After redundant SNPs 
      were excluded, 10 SNPs were individually genotyped in 223 subjects with DD and
      273 controls. Those SNPs that were significant at P</=.05 were next genotyped in 
      a semi-independent sample of 143 trios of probands with DD and their parents, to 
      control for possible population stratification. Six SNPs showed significant
      evidence of association in both samples (P</=.04-.002), including a SNP
      (rs4504469) in exon 4 of the KIAA0319 gene that changes an amino acid (P=.002;
      odds ratio 1.5). Logistic regression analysis showed that two SNPs (rs4504469 and
      rs6935076) in the KIAA0319 gene best explained DD status. The haplotype composed 
      of these two markers was significantly associated with DD (global P=.00001 in the
      case-control sample; P=.02 in trios). This finding was largely driven by
      underrepresentation of the most common haplotype in cases (P=.00003 in the
      case-control sample; P=.006 in trios; 1-degree-of-freedom tests). Our data
      strongly implicate KIAA0319 as a susceptibility gene for dyslexia. The gene
      product is expressed in brain, but its specific function is currently unknown.

TI  - A family-based association study does not support DYX1C1 on 15q21.3 as a
      candidate gene in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 491-9
AB  - We applied a family-based association approach to investigate the role of the
      DYX1C1 gene on chromosome 15q as a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia (DD)
      to 158 families containing at least one dyslexic child. We directly sequenced
      exons 2 and 10 of the DYX1C1 gene and found eight single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNPs), three of which (-3G>A, 1249 G>T, 1259 C>G) were suitable for the genetic 
      analyses. We performed single- and multimarker association analyses with DD as a 
      categorical trait by FBAT version 1.4 and TRANSMIT version 2.5.4 programs. Our
      sample had a power of at least 80% to detect an association between the selected 
      phenotypes and the informative polymorphisms at a significance level of 5%. The
      results of the categorical analyses did not support the involvement of the DYX1C1
      gene variants in this sample of dyslexics and their relatives. Quantitative and
      multimarker analyses, which provide greater power to detect loci with a minor
      effect, consistently yielded nonsignificant results. While D1X1C1 is a good
      candidate gene for DD, we were unable to replicate the original findings between 
      DYX1C1 gene and DD, perhaps due to genetic heterogeneity.

TI  - Adults with dyslexia: theta power changes during performance of a sequential
      motor task.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Performance deficits during cerebellar intensive motor tasks maybe reflected by
      discrepant theta activity in the cerebral cortex. The present experiment examined
      the relationship between performance on a novel motor task and theta activity in 
      adults with developmental dyslexia (DD) and an age- and IQ-matched control group 
      (CG). Time-locked tonic and phasic lower and upper theta measures were derived
      and separate event-related theta band power (ERBP) scores were calculated for
      each of three experimental trials. The DD made significantly more errors than CG 
      during Trials 1 and 2 of the motor task. Tonic theta did not differ between
      groups; however, the DD group displayed a significant decrease in ERBP across all
      trials and sites, specifically in central and parietal regions during Trial 3. No
      significant behavioral or physiological evidence supported the notion of
      conscious compensation (CC). Rather, deficient task performance in the DD group
      was associated with a general inability to recruit sufficient working memory
      processes.

TI  - [Characterization of the linguistic profile of a family with Perisylvian
      Syndrome].
PG  - 393-402
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perisylvian syndrome refers to a variety of clinical manifestations
      associated to lesions in the perisylvian or opercular regions. Polymicrogyria is 
      the most common structural malformation found. The syndrome may be inherited and 
      the clinical spectrum includes subtle language disturbances on one end and more
      severe characteristics such as prominent pseudobulbar signs and refractory
      epilepsy on the other end. Other studies have already associated perisylvian
      polymicrogyria with developmental language disorders or specific language
      impairment. AIM: to describe the language deficits of four members of a family
      with Perisylvian Syndrome, and to correlate these deficits to neuroimaging data. 
      METHOD: The patients underwent neuroimaging investigation, psychological
      assessment using the Weschler Intelligence Scales, and specific speech-language
      evaluation. The following tests were used for the assessment of vocabulary,
      phonology, syntax, pragmatics, reading and writing: Thematical Pictures of Yavas,
      ABFW-Child Language Test, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and other
      specific protocols. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed perisylvian
      polymicrogyria in all of the subjects, with varied locations and extensions.
      Speech-language assessment indicated significant oral and written language
      deficits in all of the subjects. CONCLUSION: The obtained data indicate that
      language impairment can co-exist with reading deficits in members of the same
      family. Neuroimaging findings reveal cortical alterations that are associated to 
      specific language impairments within the spectrum of the Perisylvian Syndrome.
      Another important aspect evidenced by this study is the similarities in the
      language profiles of siblings and mother, suggesting that a variety of linguistic
      manifestations exist within the spectrum of the syndrome. Perisylvian
      polymicrogyria can be one of the neurobiological malformations involved in the
      manifestation of these deficits.

TI  - Disorganization of semantic memory underlies alogia in schizophrenia: an analysis
      of verbal fluency performance in Japanese subjects.
PG  - 91-100
AB  - Patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired semantic memory as well as deficits 
      in a wide range of language-related functions, such as verbal fluency,
      comprehension and production of complex sentences. Since language and memory
      disturbances may underlie some of the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, the
      present study investigated the specific association between alogia (i.e. poverty 
      of speech, poverty of content of speech, blocking, and increased latency of
      response) and semantic memory organization using the category fluency task (CFT) 
      as a measure of verbal fluency. Thirty-eight patients with schizophrenia and an
      equal number of normal controls entered the study. Semantic structure was derived
      from multidimensional scaling analysis using sequential word outputs from the
      CFT. Patients with schizophrenia revealed disorganized semantic structure (e.g.
      irregular association of category members) compared with controls, consistent
      with previous reports. The patients were then divided into two groups, i.e.
      alogia- and non-alogia subjects, based on the Alogia scores from the Scale for
      the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). The symptom-based analysis showed
      that the semantic structure for the alogia group (Alogia score < or =2) was more 
      disorganized than that for the non-alogia group (Alogia score <1) although the
      number of words produced did not differ between the two groups. The results of
      cluster analysis revealed the presence of bizarre coherence specifically in the
      alogia group. These results indicate that semantic memory disorganization may
      contribute to the symptom of alogia in schizophrenia. In addition, this is one of
      the few studies that examined verbal fluency in Japanese patients with
      schizophrenia and suggest that the language abnormalities in schizophrenia are
      universal.

TI  - Tachistoscopic treatment of dyslexia changes the distribution of visual-spatial
      attention.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - Twelve children with developmental dyslexia underwent a four-month treatment with
      tachistoscopic presentation of words, according to Bakker's methodology. One
      group received standard lateral presentation of words on a PC screen, while the
      other group received the same stimuli in random lateral position. The spatial
      distribution of visual attention was measured by means of the Form-Resolving
      Field (FRF; ), which was administered along with reading tests, before and after 
      treatment. The FRF of children who received random presentation widened at -12.5 
      degrees on the left side, while the FRF in the group that received standard
      lateral presentation narrowed at that position. Both groups significantly
      improved in reading accuracy for both words and nonwords. Some hypotheses are
      proposed concerning the mechanisms responsible for the changes in the FRF and
      their correlation with improvements in word and nonword reading. The results of
      the present study are also compared with data suggesting a left "minineglect" in 
      dyslexia.

TI  - Attentional blink differences between adolescent dyslexic and normal readers.
PG  - 115-9
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the possibility that dyslexic individuals 
      require more working memory resources than normal readers to shift attention from
      stimulus to stimulus. To test this hypothesis, normal and dyslexic adolescents
      participated in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation experiment (Raymond, Shapiro, 
      & Arnell, 1992). Surprisingly, the result showed that the participants with
      dyslexia produced a shallower attentional blink than normal controls. This result
      may be interpreted as showing differences in the way the two groups encode
      information in episodic memory. They also fit in a cascade-effect perspective of 
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - [Specific remedial therapy in a specialist unit: evaluation of 31 children with
      severe, specific language or reading disorders over one academic year].
PG  - 299-310
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Up to 3 percent of the children in France present severe and
      specific language and/or reading disorders, despite regular remedial therapies.
      Few studies have measured the effectiveness of treatment administered in a
      specialist unit. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The aims of this study, focusing on
      children diagnosed as dysphasic and/or dyslexic, were: During the academic year
      2001-2002, 31 children (18 dyslexic and 13 dysphasic) were attending school in
      our unit. The teaching program and intensive speech therapy (3 hours/week) were
      tailored for each child according to his/her specific disorders. Reading,
      spelling and numeracy developmental skills of each child were evaluated by
      appropriate tools at the beginning and at the end of the year. Impairment was
      defined by measuring the gap between the observed and the expected skills,
      according to each child's age. Using a self-control method, progress achieved by 
      each child throughout the year was calculated with each tool, in each subject, by
      subtracting the impairments disclosed at the beginning from those disclosed at
      the end of the year. Progression was classified within three groups according to 
      the progress normally expected over an academic year (i.e. nine months) from
      children with no disabilities attending school regularly; a progression fewer
      than three months was considered as no progression. Uni- and multivariate
      analyses including age (< or= or />9), type of pathology (dysphasia/dyslexia),
      and intellectual quotient (IQ) as covariates was carried out to search for
      independent prognosticators. RESULTS: The entire group demonstrated during the
      year significant progress for reading (p = 0.0001), spelling (p = 0.0001) and
      numeracy (p = 0.0001). Nineteen children (61 percent) showed more progress in
      reading than normally expected over nine months. Out of the remaining 12
      children, 10 demonstrated more progress in spelling and/or numeracy than normally
      expected over nine months. All three reading evaluation tools disclosed a
      progression although one was less efficient (p = 0.05). Multivariate analysis
      disclosed age< or=9 and dysphasia as independent progress prognosticators.
      CONCLUSION: Placement in a specialist unit allows children suffering from severe 
      dyslexia and dysphasia to lessen the gap in reading, spelling and numeracy. The
      two prognosticators disclosed highlight the importance of early diagnosis (i.e.
      before nine years old) and treatment of specific language and/or reading
      disorders.

TI  - More than words: a common neural basis for reading and naming deficits in
      developmental dyslexia?
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Dyslexic individuals show subtle impairments in naming pictures of objects in
      addition to their difficulties with reading. The present study investigated
      whether word reading and picture naming deficits in developmental dyslexia can be
      reduced to a common neurological impairment. Eight dyslexic subjects, impaired on
      measures of reading, spelling and naming speed, were matched for age and general 
      ability with 10 control subjects. Participants were scanned using PET during two 
      experimental conditions: reading words and naming pictures in the form of
      corresponding line drawings. In addition, two high-level baseline conditions were
      used to control for visual and articulatory processes. Relative to the control
      group, the dyslexic participants showed reduced activation in a left
      occipitotemporal area during both word reading and picture naming. This was the
      case even in the context of intact behavioural performance during scanning.
      Abnormal activation in this region, as reported previously for reading, is
      therefore not specific to orthographic decoding but may reflect a more general
      impairment in integrating phonology and visual information. Our investigation
      points to a common neurological basis for deficits in word reading and picture
      naming in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Adults with dyslexia demonstrate space-based and object-based covert attention
      deficits: shifting attention to the periphery and shifting attention between
      objects in the left visual field.
PG  - 30-4
AB  - Performance on a covert visual attention task is compared between a group of
      adults with developmental dyslexia (specifically phonological difficulties) and a
      group of age and IQ matched controls. The group with dyslexia were generally
      slower to detect validly-cued targets. Costs of shifting attention toward the
      periphery when the target was invalidly cued were significantly higher for the
      group with dyslexia, while costs associated with shifts toward the fovea tended
      to be lower. Higher costs were also shown by the group with dyslexia for up-down 
      shifts of attention in the periphery. A visual field processing difference was
      found, in that the group with dyslexia showed higher costs associated with
      shifting attention between objects in they LVF. These findings indicate that
      these adults with dyslexia have difficulty in both the space-based and the
      object-based components of covert visual attention, and more specifically to
      stimuli located in the periphery.

TI  - Process dissociation of sight vocabulary and phonetic decoding in reading: a new 
      perspective on surface and phonological dyslexias.
PG  - 185-203
AB  - Recent research on developmental dyslexia has suggested a phonological core
      deficit hypothesis (e.g., Manis, Seidenberg, Doi, McBride-Chang, & Peterson,
      1996; Stanovich, Siegel, & Gottardo, 1997) whereby pure cases of developmental
      phonological dyslexia (dysfunctional phonetic decoding processing but normal
      sight vocabulary processing) can exist, but pure cases of developmental surface
      dyslexia (dysfunctional sight vocabulary processing but normal phonetic decoding 
      processing) should not. By applying Jacoby's (1991) and Lindsay and Jacoby's
      (1994) process dissociation procedure to the reading of regular and exception
      words, we present a method that serves to estimate readers' reliance on sight
      vocabulary and phonetic decoding during real word recognition. These reliance
      estimates are then used in Castles and Coltheart's (1993) regression-based
      approach to identify normal readers and developmental dyslexics. This new method:
      (1) allows one to explore normal reading acquisition and both the delay and
      deviance accounts of developmental dyslexia, (2) provides an alternative to
      matching dyslexics to both chronological-age and reading-age control groups, and 
      (3) uses only real words. We present evidence that pure cases of developmental
      surface dyslexia can be obtained with both Castles and Coltheart's measure as
      well as our own, and that developmental surface dyslexia is not simply a delayed 
      reading deficit. The theoretical importance and utility of estimates of reliance 
      on sight vocabulary and phonetic decoding is discussed.

TI  - Written language skills in children with benign childhood epilepsy with
      centrotemporal spikes.
PG  - 50-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this work was to study written language skills in children
      with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) in the absence
      of atypical clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG) features (n = 32), as
      compared with controls (n = 36). METHODS: BCECTS patients (7-16 years), attending
      regular school, without cognitive or behavioral regression, or atypical EEG
      patterns, completed four tests assessing written language skills and one
      nonverbal cognitive test. School performance information was recorded. Seizure
      types, duration, and frequency; awake and sleep interictal EEG findings; and
      medication status were documented. Epilepsy and educational outcome was recorded 
      for a period of 1-5 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: As a group, BCECTS patients
      performed significantly worse than controls in spelling, reading aloud, and
      reading comprehension; presented dyslexic-type errors; and frequently had
      below-average school performance. Among 11 with poor written language
      performance, 4 had developmental dysfunctions before school and seizure onset
      and, as a group, demonstrated low performance on a nonverbal cognitive test. Even
      though 65.6% were on anticonvulsants due to frequent seizures and/or seizures
      while awake, none belonged to the atypical BCECTS spectrum with respect to
      clinical or EEG findings. Increased epilepsy duration and seizure frequency were 
      less represented in patients with no or mild written language problems than in
      those with poor performance. Otherwise, clinical course and EEG findings in this 
      group were no different than those for the 11 children with severe written
      language problems. Clinical follow-up indicated that learning problems appear
      persistent and several children require remedial classes and/or tutoring after
      the epilepsy has resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Children with severe but not atypical
      BCECTS performed, as a group, significantly worse than controls in written
      language skills, specifically in spelling, reading, aloud and reading
      comprehension; they also presented many difficulties also found in children with 
      dyslexia. However, poor written language performance was not considered specific 
      to BCECTS because it occurred in children with generally low cognitive capacity
      and/or preexisting developmental dysfunctions. Moreover, a dissociation between
      epilepsy outcome and learning problem outcome, in the subgroup with poor
      performance, casts doubt on the existence of a possible causal link between
      BCECTS and educational performance.

TI  - Language cannot be reduced to biology: perspectives from neuro-developmental
      disorders affecting language learning.
PG  - 129-37; discussion 139-42
AB  - The study of language knowledge guided by a purely biological perspective
      prioritizes the study of syntax. The essential process of syntax is
      recursion--the ability to generate an infinite array of expressions from a
      limited set of elements. Researchers working within the biological perspective
      argue that this ability is possible only because of an innately specified genetic
      makeup that is specific to human beings. Such a view of language knowledge may be
      fully justified in discussions on biolinguistics, and in evolutionary biology.
      However, it is grossly inadequate in understanding language-learning problems,
      particularly those experienced by children with neurodevelopmental disorders such
      as developmental dyslexia, Williams syndrome, specific language impairment and
      autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, syntax-centered definitions of language 
      knowledge completely ignore certain crucial aspects of language learning and use,
      namely, that language is embedded in a social context; that the role of
      envrironmental triggering as a learning mechanism is grossly underestimated; that
      a considerable extent of visuo-spatial information accompanies speech in
      day-to-day communication; that the developmental process itself lies at the heart
      of knowledge acquisition; and that there is a tremendous variation in the
      orthographic systems associated with different languages. All these
      (socio-cultural) factors can influence the rate and quality of spoken and written
      language acquisition resulting in much variation in phenotypes associated with
      disorders known to have a genetic component. Delineation of such phenotypic
      variability requires inputs from varied disciplines such as neurobiology,
      neuropsychology, linguistics and communication disorders. In this paper, I
      discuss published research that questions cognitive modularity and emphasises the
      role of the environment for understanding linguistic capabilities of children
      with neuro-developmental disorders. The discussion pertains to two specific
      disorders, developmental dyslexia and Williams syndrome.

TI  - Language disorder in schizophrenia as a developmental learning disorder.
PG  - 5-20
AB  - Receptive language disorder in schizophrenia is hypothesized to represent a
      learning disorder that involves a neurodevelopmental etiology. It is argued that 
      a preexisting developmental language disorder may characterize a subset of
      schizophrenia patients. A primary deficit in the temporal dynamics of brain
      function is assumed to cause receptive language disorder in schizophrenia. This
      hypothesized core deficit includes both disturbance in the processing of rapid,
      sequential information and disruptions to patterns of brain activation and
      synchronization. These timing deficits may alter the way associative connections 
      are formed and/or accessed in semantic memory. It is suggested that abnormalities
      in second-messenger pathways of subcortical-cortical circuitry offer an
      etiological nexus for language dysfunction in schizophrenia and developmental
      dyslexia.

TI  - Posterior parietal cortex and developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 79-94
AB  - Dyslexia is defined as a specific reading disorder despite normal intelligence
      and conventional teaching. One of the most influential theories attempting to
      explain problems suffered by dyslexics assumes that dyslexia is caused by
      deficits of the magnocellular system. This system, generally responsible for
      processing fast sensory information, projects mostly to the parietal cortex.
      Consistent with this theory, dyslexics should have problems with tasks which
      specifically involve parietal cortex. In the article, we review data and show
      that, indeed, dyslexics have problems with fast attention shifts, show some
      symptoms of mild unilateral neglect syndrome and have abnormal saccadic and
      pursuit eye movements. Little is known about visuo-motor coordination and mental 
      rotation, the tasks in which the parietal cortex is thought to play important
      roles.

TI  - Visual and auditory attentional capture are both sluggish in children with
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 61-72
AB  - Automatic multimodal spatial attention was studied in 12 dyslexic children (SRD),
      18 chronological age matched (CA) and 9 reading level matched (RL) normally
      reading children by measuring reaction times (RTs) to lateralized visual and
      auditory stimuli in cued detection tasks. The results show a slower time course
      of focused multimodal attention (FMA) in SRD children than in both CA and RL
      controls. Specifically, no cueing effect (i.e., RTs difference between
      cued-uncued) was found in SRD children at 100 ms cue-target delay, while it was
      present at 250 ms cue-target delay. In contrast, in both CA and RL controls, a
      cueing effect was found at the shorter cue-target delay but it disappeared at the
      longer cue-target delay, as predicted by theories of automatic capture of
      attention. Our results suggest that FMA may be crucial for learning to read, and 
      we propose a possible causal explanation of how a FMA deficit leads to specific
      reading disability, suggesting that sluggish FMA in dyslexic children could be
      caused by a specific parietal dysfunction.

TI  - Family-based association study of DYX1C1 variants in autism.
PG  - 127-30
AB  - DYX1C1: was recently identified as a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia,
      which is characterized by an unexpected difficulty in learning to read and write 
      despite adequate intelligence, motivation, and education. It will be important to
      clarify, whether the phenotype caused by DYX1C1 extends to other language-related
      or comorbid disorders. Impaired language development is one of the essential
      features in autism. Therefore, we analyzed the allelic distribution of the DYX1C1
      gene by family-based association method in 100 Finnish autism families. No
      evidence for association was observed with any intragenic marker or with
      haplotypes constructed from alleles of several adjacent markers. No evidence for 
      deviated allelic diversity was either observed: the frequency of expected
      dyslexia risk haplotype was comparable to its frequency in Finnish controls. Thus
      it seems unlikely that DYX1C1 gene would be involved in the genetic etiology of
      autism in Finnish patients.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia--recurrence risk estimates from a german bi-center study
      using the single proband sib pair design.
PG  - 136-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies have demonstrated a genetic component for dyslexia.
      However, both segregation and linkage analyses show contradictory results
      pointing at the necessity of an optimal ascertainment scheme for molecular
      genetic studies. Previously, we have argued that the single proband sib pair
      design (SPSP) would be optimal. The aims of this paper therefore are to
      demonstrate the practicability of the SPSP design and the estimation of
      recurrence risks for reading and writing. METHODS: We assessed spelling and
      reading in a family sample ascertained through the SPSP design. 287 families with
      at least two siblings and their parents were recruited. At least one child was
      affected with spelling disorder according to a one standard deviation (1SD)
      discrepancy criterion. RESULTS: Mean values for probands and their siblings were 
      different for both the spelling and the reading phenotype. For the probands,
      variances of the phenotype spelling were smaller. These effects became stronger
      with more extreme selection criteria. Both siblings fulfilled the 1SD criterion
      for spelling and reading in 60.3 and 28.9% of the families, respectively,
      indicating a low cost efficiency of the double proband sib pair approach. A
      recurrence risk of 4.52 (CI: 4.07-4.93) was obtained for spelling when the 1SD
      criterion was applied to both siblings. Recurrence risk estimates were similar
      for reading. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the suitability of the SPSP
      design for genetic analysis of dyslexia. The recurrence risk estimates may be
      used for determining sample sizes in gene mapping studies.

TI  - No evidence for association between dyslexia and DYX1C1 functional variants in a 
      group of children and adolescents from Southern Italy.
PG  - 311-4
AB  - Recently, DYX1C1, a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia, encoding a nuclear
      tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein dynamically regulated in brain, has been 
      characterized through a translocation breakpoint in a Finnish family. Two
      putatively functional variants, -3G/A and 1249G/T, have been reported to be
      significantly associated with dyslexia in this population. Further studies,
      conducted on different ethnic groups (English and Canadian), have not confirmed a
      role for DYX1C1 variants in increasing the risk for dyslexia. We investigated the
      role of these variants in dyslexic children and adolescents from Southern Italy. 
      No significant evidence for association between dyslexia and these DYX1C1
      putative functional variants has been shown. We argue that the different DYX1C1
      allele frequencies shown among Italian and Finnish subjects with dyslexia could
      be attributable to the different linkage disequilibrium structure of these
      populations.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia, learning and the cerebellum.
PG  - 19-36
AB  - Theoretical frameworks for dyslexia must explain how the well-established
      phonological deficits and the literacy deficits arise. Our longstanding research 
      programme has led to a distinctive 'twin level' framework that proposes, first,
      that the core deficits are well described in terms of poor skill automaticity.
      Second, these 'cognitive level' symptoms are attributed to abnormal cerebellar
      function--a 'brain-level' analysis. The evidence includes data from behavioural, 
      imaging, neuroanatomical and learning studies. The frame-work leads to an
      'ontogenetic' analysis that links cerebellar deficit at birth, via problems in
      articulation and working memory, to the known phonological, speed and literacy
      difficulties. Differences in locus of cerebellar impairment, experience and/or
      links to other brain regions may account for subtypes of dyslexia and possibly
      other developmental disorders. The automaticity/ cerebellar deficit framework
      provides an explicit demonstration that it is possible to explain motor, speed
      and phonological deficits within a unified account, integrating previously
      opposed approaches.

      interhemispheric processing and integration is with the redundant stimuli task,
      where participants respond to stimuli presented to the left visual field, right
      visual field, or both visual fields simultaneously. In neurologically normal
      individuals, response times to bilateral simple stimulus presentations are faster
      than response times to a single stimulus in either visual field alone (referred
      to as redundancy gain). In contrast, individuals with no corpus callosum exhibit 
      greater redundancy gains than would be expected by probability summation. In the 
      present study, 11 children with phonological dyslexia showed a similar "over
      violation" of the probability (race) model when responding with the left but not 
      the right hand. This asymmetry was not found in age- and IQ-matched control
      children. The results are at least partially consistent with the notion of
      phonological dyslexia involving deficits in the transfer of information across
      the corpus callosum.

TI  - Gray matter alteration in dyslexia: converging evidence from volumetric and
      voxel-by-voxel MRI analyses.
PG  - 324-31
AB  - Affecting up to 4-10% of the population, dyslexia is a highly prevalent,
      childhood onset developmental disorder adversely influencing multiple domains of 
      adaptive functioning throughout the lifespan. The present brain imaging study was
      conducted in order to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of developmental
      dyslexia. The MRI brain scans of 10 males with dyslexia and 14 matched controls
      were analyzed with (1) a classical volumetric method measuring gray and white
      matter lobar volumes and (2) a voxel-by-voxel method. The voxel-by-voxel method
      identifies changes in tissue density and localizes morphologic alterations
      without limiting the analyses to predefined regions. Subsequent correlations
      between gray matter density and neuropsychological performance on specific
      phonological processing tasks (rhyme judgment) were conducted. Volumetric
      analyses revealed significantly reduced gray matter volumes in both temporal
      lobes in dyslexic individuals. The voxel-by-voxel analyses further localized
      changes to the left temporal lobe, revealing reduced gray matter density in the
      middle and inferior temporal gyri. Conversely, increased gray matter density was 
      found in the precentral gyri bilaterally. As a combined group, the dyslexic and
      control subjects demonstrated positive correlations between performance on the
      rhyme judgment tasks and gray matter density in the middle and inferior frontal
      gyri, and the middle temporal gyri bilaterally. The current study indicates that 
      dyslexia is associated with a structural gray matter deficit involving a complex 
      fronto-temporal network implicated in phonological processing.

TI  - Reading acquisition, developmental dyslexia, and skilled reading across
      languages: a psycholinguistic grain size theory.
PG  - 3-29
AB  - The development of reading depends on phonological awareness across all languages
      so far studied. Languages vary in the consistency with which phonology is
      represented in orthography. This results in developmental differences in the
      grain size of lexical representations and accompanying differences in
      developmental reading strategies and the manifestation of dyslexia across
      orthographies. Differences in lexical representations and reading across
      languages leave developmental "footprints" in the adult lexicon. The lexical
      organization and processing strategies that are characteristic of skilled reading
      in different orthographies are affected by different developmental constraints in
      different writing systems. The authors develop a novel theoretical framework to
      explain these cross-language data, which they label a psycholinguistic grain size
      theory of reading and its development.

PG  - 3229-30
AB  - Recent developments in brain research and in the field of music therapy have led 
      to the development of music-based methods specifically aimed at relieving
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other neurologic disorders. Rhythmic auditory
      stimulation uses external rhythmic auditory cues from song, music or metronome to
      aid patients improving their walking functioning and has been shown to be
      effective both within sessions and as a result of training over time. Melodic
      intonation therapy and related vocal techniques can improve expressive dysphasia 
      and aid rehabilitation of neurologic disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease,
      stroke and developmental disorders.

TI  - A 77-kilobase region of chromosome 6p22.2 is associated with dyslexia in families
      from the United Kingdom and from the United States.
PG  - 1046-58
AB  - Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence developmental dyslexia
      (reading disability [RD]) have been mapped to chromosome regions by linkage
      analysis. The most consistently replicated area of linkage is on chromosome
      6p23-21.3. We used association analysis in 223 siblings from the United Kingdom
      to identify an underlying QTL on 6p22.2. Our association study implicates a 77-kb
      region spanning the gene TTRAP and the first four exons of the neighboring
      uncharacterized gene KIAA0319. The region of association is also directly
      upstream of a third gene, THEM2. We found evidence of these associations in a
      second sample of siblings from the United Kingdom, as well as in an independent
      sample of twin-based sibships from Colorado. One main RD risk haplotype that has 
      a frequency of approximately 12% was found in both the U.K. and U.S. samples. The
      haplotype is not distinguished by any protein-coding polymorphisms, and,
      therefore, the functional variation may relate to gene expression. The QTL
      influences a broad range of reading-related cognitive abilities but has no
      significant impact on general cognitive performance in these samples. In
      addition, the QTL effect may be largely limited to the severe range of reading
      disability.

TI  - The development of children at familial risk for dyslexia: birth to early school 
      age.
PG  - 184-220
AB  - Children at risk for familial dyslexia (n = 107) and their controls (n = 93) have
      been followed from birth to school entry in the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal study of
      Dyslexia (JLD) on developmental factors linked to reading and dyslexia. At the
      point of school entry, the majority of the at-risk children displayed decoding
      ability that fell at least 1 SD below the mean of the control group. Measures of 
      speech processing were the earliest indices to show both group differences in
      infancy and also significant predictive associations with reading acquisition. A 
      number of measures of language, including phonological and morphological skill
      collected repeatedly from age three, revealed group differences and predictive
      correlations. Both the group differences and the predictive associations to later
      language and reading ability strengthened as a function of increasing age. The
      predictions, however, tend to be stronger and the spectrum of significant
      correlations wider in the at-risk group. These results are crucial to early
      identification and intervention of dyslexia in at-risk children.

TI  - Neurocognitive profiles in Salla disease.
PG  - 832-7
AB  - Salla disease, a free sialic acid storage disorder, is one of the 36 currently
      known disorders in Finland that form the Finnish disease heritage. Salla disease 
      leads to learning disability* with a wide clinical variation. Two main categories
      of the disease have been classified: a conventional subtype and a severe subtype 
      with more severe defects. We present detailed neurocognitive profiles of 41
      Finnish patients with Salla disease (19 females, 22 males; age range 11mo to 63y,
      median 19y). The neurocognitive development of patients with Salla disease was
      assessed by psychological and neuropsychological testing. All patients were also 
      examined by a paediatric neurologist and a speech therapist. The characteristic
      cognitive profile consisted of a lower non-verbal performance (mean developmental
      age 13mo) compared with linguistic skills (mean developmental age 17mo). In
      particular, spatial and visual-constructive impairments were typical of these
      patients. Tactile and visual discrimination of forms was poor. Tasks demanding
      hand-eye coordination, maintenance of visual attention, and those requiring
      short-term visual memory and executive skills were performed better. Receptive
      language skills were notably better compared with expressive speech. The
      patients' interactive and non-verbal communication skills were quite strong.
      Another typical pattern with Salla disease was severe motor disability. After the
      second decade of life, the decline in these skills was more pronounced than
      patients' cognitive deterioration. Our results indicate that even though there is
      a considerable variation in the clinical findings of patients with Salla disease,
      the characteristic neurocognitive profile of the disease can be outlined.

TI  - Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood developmental and psychiatric
      disorders.
PG  - 1215-22
AB  - Both omega-3 and omega-6 long-chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) are crucial to brain
      development and function, but omega-3 LC-PUFA in particular are often lacking in 
      modern diets in developed countries. Increasing evidence, reviewed here,
      indicates that LC-PUFA deficiencies or imbalances are associated with childhood
      developmental and psychiatric disorders including ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and 
      autistic spectrum disorders. These conditions show a high clinical overlap and
      run in the same families, as well as showing associations with various adult
      psychiatric disorders in which FA abnormalities are already implicated, such as
      depression, other mood disorders, and schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence from
      controlled trials also suggests that dietary supplementation with LC-PUFA might
      help in the management of these kinds of childhood behavioral and learning
      difficulties. Treatment with omega-3 FA appears most promising, but the few small
      studies published to date have involved different populations, study designs,
      treatments, and outcome measures. Large-scale studies are now needed to confirm
      the benefits reported. Further research is also required to assess the durability
      of such treatment effects, to determine optimal treatment compositions and
      dosages, and to develop reliable ways of identifying those individuals most
      likely to benefit from this kind of treatment. Childhood developmental and
      psychiatric disorders clearly reflect multifactorial influences, but the study of
      LC-PUFA and their metabolism could offer important new approaches to their early 
      identification and management. Heterogeneity and comorbidity are such, however,
      that a focus on specific traits or symptoms may prove more fruitful than an
      exclusive reliance on current diagnostic categories.

      long-term outcome in three Italian children aged 7, 8 and 5, respectively, who
      experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). All children presented with 
      headache, associated to nausea, vomiting and papilloedema. None suffered from
      epileptic seizures. In two of them a paresis of the sixth cranial nerve with
      diplopia was found. Diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging
      angiography (angio MRI) in all cases. In all patients plasma levels of protein C,
      protein S, antithrombin III (AT III), antiphospholipid antibodies (ApA) and
      homocysteine were detected. Furthermore, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin
      mutation G20210A and MTHFR mutation were searched for. A Protein C reduction was 
      detected in all patients at onset; this finding, however, was not confirmed at
      follow-up in all of them. At one-year follow-up, neurological examination was
      normal in all children and neuropsychological assessment, aimed at excluding
      linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive deficits, revealed normal performances in
      two of them. In the third child, cognitive assessment confirmed a previously
      diagnosed developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Neurobiology of dyslexia: a reinterpretation of the data.
PG  - 720-6
AB  - Theories of developmental dyslexia differ on how to best interpret the great
      variety of symptoms (linguistic, sensory and motor) observed in dyslexic
      individuals. One approach views dyslexia as a specific phonological deficit,
      which sometimes co-occurs with a more general sensorimotor syndrome. This article
      on the neurobiology of dyslexia shows that neurobiological data are indeed
      consistent with this view, explaining both how a specific phonological deficit
      might arise, and why a sensorimotor syndrome should be significantly associated
      with it. This new conceptualisation of the aetiology of dyslexia could generalize
      to other neurodevelopmental disorders, and might further explain heterogeneity
      within each disorder and comorbidity between disorders.

TI  - Linkage analyses of four regions previously implicated in dyslexia: confirmation 
      of a locus on chromosome 15q.
PG  - 67-75
AB  - Dyslexia is a common, complex disorder, which is thought to have a genetic
      component. There have been numerous reports of linkage to several regions of the 
      genome for dyslexia and continuous dyslexia-related phenotypes. We attempted to
      confirm linkage of continuous measures of (1) accuracy and efficiency of
      phonological decoding; and (2) accuracy of single word reading (WID) to regions
      on chromosomes 2p, 6p, 15q, and 18p, using 111 families with a total of 898
      members. We used both single-marker and multipoint variance components linkage
      analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) joint segregation and linkage
      analysis for initial inspection of these regions. Positive results were followed 
      with traditional parametric lod score analysis using a model estimated by MCMC
      segregation analysis. No positive linkage signals were found on chromosomes 2p,
      6p, or 18p. Evidence of linkage of WID to chromosome 15q was found with both
      methods of analysis. The maximum single-marker parametric lod score of 2.34 was
      obtained at a distance of 3 cM from D15S143. Multipoint analyses localized the
      putative susceptibility gene to the interval between markers GATA50C03 and
      D15S143, which falls between a region implicated in a recent genome screen for
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and DYX1C1, a candidate gene for
      dyslexia. This apparent multiplicity of linkage signals in the region for
      developmental disorders may be the result of errors in map and/or model
      specification obscuring the pleiotropic effect of a single gene on different
      phenotypes, or it may reflect the presence of multiple genes.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: ERP correlates of anomalous phonological processing
      during spoken word recognition.
PG  - 360-76
AB  - Ample evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia results from a phonological
      deficit that may not be reducible to a low-level auditory deficit. Yet, on-line
      phonological processing (in)capacities in dyslexics remain virtually unexplored, 
      as studies have typically focused on either meta-phonological awareness tasks or,
      at the other extreme, basic perceptual tasks. The present study investigates
      event-related potential (ERP) correlates of implicit phonological processing
      during the recognition of spoken words in dyslexic and normally reading children 
      (7-10 years). We examined general ERP morphology and alliteration priming effects
      on ERP measures in an auditory lexical decision task. Primes were words
      (Experiment 1) and non-words (Experiment 2). Alliteration priming effects
      suggested a distinct pattern of normal versus anomalous aspects of spoken word
      processing in dyslexic children. Whereas dyslexics showed deviant priming effects
      in earlier time windows encompassing the N1 and N2, later N400 priming effects
      were comparable to those of normal readers. The same pattern of results was also 
      present in group comparisons of general ERP morphology. These findings suggest
      that dyslexics have selective processing anomalies at an earlier
      phonetic/phonological level, while processing at a later phonological/lexical
      level proceeds normally. In particular, our results indicate an anomalous
      contribution of phonological (word onset) information to the processing of spoken
      words, which may be related to time-course aspects of phonetic/phonological
      processing.

TI  - The cognitive deficits responsible for developmental dyslexia: review of evidence
      for a selective visual attentional disorder.
PG  - 339-63
AB  - There is strong converging evidence suggesting that developmental dyslexia stems 
      from a phonological processing deficit. However, this hypothesis has been
      challenged by the widely admitted heterogeneity of the dyslexic population, and
      by several reports of dyslexic individuals with no apparent phonological deficit.
      In this paper, we discuss the hypothesis that a phonological deficit may not be
      the only core deficit in developmental dyslexia and critically examine several
      alternative proposals. To establish that a given cognitive deficit is causally
      related to dyslexia, at least two conditions need to be fulfilled. First, the
      hypothesized deficit needs to be associated with developmental dyslexia
      independently of additional phonological deficits. Second, the hypothesized
      deficit must predict reading ability, on both empirical and theoretical grounds. 
      While most current hypotheses fail to fulfil these criteria, we argue that the
      visual attentional deficit hypothesis does. Recent studies providing evidence for
      the independence of phonological and visual attentional deficits in developmental
      dyslexia are reviewed together with empirical data showing that phonological and 
      visual attentional processing skills contribute independently to reading
      performance. A theoretical model of reading is outlined in support of a causal
      link between a visual attentional disorder and a failure in reading acquisition.

TI  - Prevalence of persistent primary reflexes and motor problems in children with
      reading difficulties.
PG  - 316-38
AB  - It has been shown that some children with reading difficulties have underlying
      developmental delay and that this may be related to the persistence of primary
      reflexes. This study investigated the prevalence of persistent primary reflexes
      in the ordinary primary school population and how this related to other cognitive
      and social factors. Three groups of 41 children were drawn from a representative,
      cross-sectional sample of 409 children (aged 9-10 years) attending 11 ordinary
      primary schools in N. Ireland. The three groups represented the bottom, middle
      and top 10% respectively of readers from the total sample population. The
      relative persistence (on a scale of 0 to 4) of the Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex
      (ATNR) and the prevalence of motor difficulties were assessed for these 3 groups.
      The role of 5 predictor variables (verbal IQ, social deprivation, sex, month of
      birth and religious affiliation) in determining the reading level of the total
      sample was also investigated. It was found that the lowest reading group had a
      significantly higher mean level of ATNR (1.56 [95% CI 1.22-1.90]) compared with
      the middle reading group (0.56 [0.22-0.90]) and the top reading group (0.59
      [0.25-0.92]). 17% of children in the lowest reading group had extremely high
      levels of the ATNR while 24% showed no presence of ATNR. This contrasted with 0% 
      and 66%, respectively for both middle and top reading groups. It was also found
      that there was a significant difference between the lowest reading group and the 
      top reading group on a standardised test of motor ability. Furthermore, there was
      evidence that ATNR persistence but not motor ability was associated with the sex 
      of the child with boys, in particular, at risk. There was no evidence that ATNR
      persistence or motor ability was significantly associated with social
      deprivation. It was also found that there were no significant differences between
      dyslexic and non-dyslexic children with reading difficulties in motor (including 
      balance) performance. This study highlights the high levels of primary reflex
      persistence in children with reading difficulties and it provides further
      evidence of the association between reading difficulties and movement
      difficulties in young children. However, while the implications for intervention 
      are discussed, it is stressed that the persistence of primary reflexes cannot be 
      used as a causal model for reading difficulties, including dyslexia.

TI  - Deficits in dyslexia: barking up the wrong tree?
PG  - 289-98
AB  - Reviews of the dyslexia literature often seem to suggest that children with
      dyslexia perform at a lower level on almost any task. Richards et al. (Dyslexia
      2002; 8: 1-8) note the importance of being able to demonstrate dissociations
      between tasks. However, increasingly elegant experiments, in which dissociations 
      are found, almost inevitably find that the performance of children with dyslexia 
      is lower as tasks become more difficult! By looking for deficits in dyslexia,
      could we be barking up the wrong tree? A methodological approach for
      circumventing this potential problem is discussed.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment: same or different?
PG  - 858-86
AB  - Developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI) were for many years
      treated as distinct disorders but are now often regarded as different
      manifestations of the same underlying problem, differing only in severity or
      developmental stage. The merging of these categories has been motivated by the
      reconceptualization of dyslexia as a language disorder in which phonological
      processing is deficient. The authors argue that this focus underestimates the
      independent influence of semantic and syntactic deficits, which are widespread in
      SLI and which affect reading comprehension and impair attainment of fluent
      reading in adolescence. The authors suggest that 2 dimensions of impairment are
      needed to conceptualize the relationship between these disorders and to capture
      phenotypic features that are important for identifying neurobiologically and
      etiologically coherent subgroups.

TI  - Pediatric neuro-ophthalmology.
PG  - 437-43
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will update the ophthalmologist on recent
      developments in pediatric neuro-ophthalmology. RECENT FINDINGS: Research into the
      genetics of congenital strabismus syndromes has brought new insights into the
      development of the ocular motor system. There is also new literature on childhood
      ocular myasthenia gravis and childhood neurosarcoidosis. The results of three
      different surgical treatments for congenital nystagmus are described. Reviews on 
      cortical visual impairment, dyslexia, Aicardi syndrome, and neuronal ceroid
      lipofuscinosis are presented. SUMMARY: Pediatric neuro-ophthalmology is a diverse
      and challenging field. As we strive to provide excellent care to these patients, 
      we will use the results of basic science, genetic, and neurobiological research.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia.
PG  - 765-71
AB  - Developmental dyscalculia is a specific learning disability affecting the normal 
      acquisition of arithmetic skills. Genetic, neurobiologic, and epidemiologic
      evidence indicates that dyscalculia, like other learning disabilities, is a
      brain-based disorder. However, poor teaching and environmental deprivation have
      also been implicated in its etiology. Because the neural network of both
      hemispheres comprises the substrate of normal arithmetic skills, dyscalculia can 
      result from dysfunction of either hemisphere, although the left parietotemporal
      area is of particular significance. The prevalence of developmental dyscalculia
      is 5 to 6% in the school-aged population and is as common in girls as in boys.
      Dyscalculia can occur as a consequence of prematurity and low birthweight and is 
      frequently encountered in a variety of neurologic disorders, such as
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental language disorder,
      epilepsy, and fragile X syndrome. Developmental dyscalculia has proven to be a
      persisting learning disability, at least for the short term, in about half of
      affected preteen pupils. Educational interventions for dyscalculia range from
      rote learning of arithmetic facts to developing strategies for solving arithmetic
      exercises. The long-term prognosis of dyscalculia and the role of remediation in 
      its outcome are yet to be determined.

TI  - Current status of treatments for dyslexia: critical review.
PG  - 744-58
AB  - The acquisition of reading is a complex neurobiologic process. Identifying the
      most effective instruction and remedial intervention methods for children at risk
      of developing reading problems and for those who are already struggling is
      equally complex. This article aims to provide the clinician with a review of more
      current findings on the prevention and remediation of reading problems in
      children, along with an approach to considering the diagnosis and treatment of a 
      child with dyslexia. The first part of the review describes interventions
      targeted at preventing reading difficulties in the at-risk younger child. The
      second part of the review discusses the efficacy of approaches to treat the
      older, reading-disabled child ("intervention studies"). Factors that impact the
      response to treatment are also discussed, as are neuroimaging studies that offer 
      insight into how the brain responds to treatment interventions. With appropriate 
      instruction, at-risk readers can become both accurate and fluent readers. In
      contrast, although intensive, evidence-based remedial interventions can markedly 
      improve reading accuracy in older, reading-disabled children, they have been
      significantly less effective in closing the fluency gap. Owing to the dynamic
      course of language development and the changes in language demands over time,
      even after a child has demonstrated a substantial response to treatment
      interventions, his or her subsequent progress should be carefully tracked to
      ensure optimal progress toward the development of functional reading and written 
      language skills.

TI  - In search of the auditory, phonetic, and/or phonological problems in dyslexia:
      context effects in speech perception.
PG  - 1030-47
AB  - There is a growing consensus that developmental dyslexia is associated with a
      phonological-core deficit. One symptom of this phonological deficit is a subtle
      speech-perception deficit. The auditory basis of this deficit is still hotly
      debated. If people with dyslexia, however, do not have an auditory deficit and
      perceive the underlying acoustic dimensions of speech as well as people who read 
      normally, then why do they exhibit a categorical-perception deficit? A potential 
      answer to this conundrum lies in the possibility that people with dyslexia do not
      adequately handle the context-dependent variation that speech signals typically
      contain. A mathematical model simulating such a sensitivity deficit mimics the
      speech-perception deficits attributed to dyslexia. To assess the nature of the
      dyslexic problem, the authors examined whether children with dyslexia handle
      context dependencies in speech differently than do normal-reading individuals.
      Contrary to the initial hypothesis, children with dyslexia did not show less
      context sensitivity in speech perception than did normal-reading individuals at
      auditory, phonetic, and phonological levels of processing, nor did they reveal
      any categorization deficit. Instead, intrinsic properties of online phonological 
      processes, not phonological representations per se, may be impaired in dyslexia.

TI  - Biological abnormality of impaired reading is constrained by culture.
PG  - 71-6
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterized by a severe reading problem in people who
      have normal intelligence and schooling. Impaired reading of alphabetic scripts is
      associated with dysfunction of left temporoparietal brain regions. These regions 
      perform phonemic analysis and conversion of written symbols to phonological units
      of speech (grapheme-to-phoneme conversion); two central cognitive processes that 
      mediate reading acquisition. Furthermore, it has been assumed that, in contrast
      to cultural diversities, dyslexia in different languages has a universal
      biological origin. Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging with 
      reading-impaired Chinese children and associated controls, that functional
      disruption of the left middle frontal gyrus is associated with impaired reading
      of the Chinese language (a logographic rather than alphabetic writing system).
      Reading impairment in Chinese is manifested by two deficits: one relating to the 
      conversion of graphic form (orthography) to syllable, and the other concerning
      orthography-to-semantics mapping. Both of these processes are critically mediated
      by the left middle frontal gyrus, which functions as a centre for fluent Chinese 
      reading that coordinates and integrates various information about written
      characters in verbal and spatial working memory. This finding provides an insight
      into the fundamental pathophysiology of dyslexia by suggesting that rather than
      having a universal origin, the biological abnormality of impaired reading is
      dependent on culture.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia and basic numerical capacities: a study of 8-9-year-old
      students.
PG  - 99-125
AB  - Thirty-one 8- and 9-year-old children selected for dyscalculia, reading
      difficulties or both, were compared to controls on a range of basic number
      processing tasks. Children with dyscalculia only had impaired performance on the 
      tasks despite high-average performance on tests of IQ, vocabulary and working
      memory tasks. Children with reading disability were mildly impaired only on tasks
      that involved articulation, while children with both disorders showed a pattern
      of numerical disability similar to that of the dyscalculic group, with no special
      features consequent on their reading or language deficits. We conclude that
      dyscalculia is the result of specific disabilities in basic numerical processing,
      rather than the consequence of deficits in other cognitive abilities.

TI  - Spatial load factor in prediction of reading performance.
PG  - 440-9
AB  - Abstract This study investigated whether there is a relationship between reading 
      age and clinical optometric tests that have varying degrees of spatial loading in
      their design. Spatial loading in this context is the demand on the visual system 
      to process information about the relative position and orientation of stimuli. A 
      total of 112 children aged 8-11 years were assessed using saccadic eye movement
      and rapid naming tasks with varying spatial loads. All were subtests of Garzia's 
      Developmental Eye Movement test and Liubinas' SeeRite Reading Diagnostic
      Programme. Variability in load was achieved by comparing rapid naming of numerals
      vs the spatially loaded letters p, d, b, q; and by comparing the speed of reading
      numerals presented in increasingly complex arrays. Reading Age was assessed
      independently and results were analysed by multiple logistic regression.
      Spatially loaded naming tasks performed at speed exposed a Spatial Loading Factor
      which clearly differentiates children at risk with reading.

      neuropsychological results].
PG  - 907-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to test children with developmental dyslexia for possible
      alterations of their spatial and visuoperceptual ability. METHODS: A total of 31 
      children with developmental dyslexia were included in the study. All children
      underwent a complete ophthalmological and orthoptic examination.
      Neuropsychological testing was performed using the Visual Object and Space
      Perception Battery (VOSP) and the subtest "Gestalt Closure" of the Kaufman
      Assessment Battery for children. Even though the VOSP is validated and
      standardized for adults, no normal values for children exist thus far. Therefore,
      a sex- and age-matched control group was tested. In addition, the parents of the 
      dyslectic children completed the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 4-18
      (CBCL/4-18). RESULTS: All children presented normal ophthalmological and
      orthoptic findings. Performance in the VOSP subtests "progressive silhouettes
      test'" and "number location" was significantly reduced in dyslectic children when
      compared to controls ( p<0.0003 and p<0.046, respectively). There was also a
      tendency towards lower values in the subtest "position discrimination" ( p=0.07).
      In the other subtests no significant difference between dyslectic children and
      controls was observed. The results of the subtest "Gestalt Closure" of the K-ABC 
      and the CBCL/4-18 were within normal ranges. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates
      that developmental dyslexia is not based on ocular deficits, but indicates
      possible disturbances of visual-spatial cognition and visual-spatial perception
      in dyslectic children.

TI  - Visual and auditory temporal processing and early reading development.
PG  - 234-52
AB  - This study investigated the ability of temporal processing measures obtained
      before school entry to predict early reading development in an unselected sample 
      of 125 children (68 males, 57 females). Visual and auditory temporal order
      judgement (TOJ) tasks measured at Preschool (mean age 5.36 years) significantly
      predicted letter and word identification (accuracy) and reading rate (fluency) in
      early Grade 1 (mean age 5.94 years), even after the effects of age, environment, 
      memory, attention, nonverbal ability, and speech/language problems were accounted
      for. There were no significant differences in the overall variance accounted for 
      in reading between TOJ measures taken before or after reading had emerged. Both
      Preschool and Grade 1 measures of auditory TOJ accounted for significant
      independent variance in reading. However, only visual TOJ performance measured at
      Grade 1 accounted for unique variance in reading rate. This was discussed in
      terms of developmental changes in the role of visual temporal processing as
      reading develops. Reliability of the temporal measures from Preschool to Grade 1 
      was moderate. The results showed that measures of visual and auditory temporal
      processing obtained close to school-entry would be a useful addition to
      predicting risk of early reading difficulties.

TI  - Early development of children at familial risk for dyslexia--follow-up from birth
      to school age.
PG  - 146-78
AB  - We review the main findings of the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal study of Dyslexia (JLD)
      which follows the development of children at familial risk for dyslexia (N = 107)
      and their controls (N = 93). We will illustrate the development of these two
      groups of children at ages from birth to school entry in the skill domains that
      have been connected to reading and reading disability in the prior literature. At
      school entry, the highest score on the decoding task among the poorer half
      (median) of the at risk children--i.e. of those presumably being most likely
      genetically affected--is 1 SD below the mean of the control group. Thus, the
      familial risk for dyslexia shows expected consequences. Among the earliest
      measures in which group differences as well as significant predictive
      associations with the first steps in reading have emerged, are indices of speech 
      processing in infancy. Likewise, various measures of early language including
      pronunciation accuracy, phonological, and morphological skills (but not
      performance IQ) show both group differences and predictive correlations, the
      majority of which become stronger as the reliability of the measures increases by
      age. Predictive relationships tend to be strong in general but higher in the at
      risk group because of its larger variance in both the predictor variables and in 
      the dependent measures, such as early acquisition of reading. The results are
      thus promising in increasing our understanding needed for early identification
      and prevention of dyslexia.

TI  - Pediatric stroke among Hong Kong Chinese subjects.
PG  - e206-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of pediatric stroke was estimated to be 2.5 to 2.7
      cases per 100,000 children per year in North America and 13 cases per 100,000
      children per year in France. Stroke is among the top 10 causes of death among
      children in the United States, with the highest incidence in the first 1 year of 
      life. The annual mortality rate was 0.34 deaths per 100,000 person-years, with an
      average of 244 deaths per year. Interethnic differences have been demonstrated to
      be important in pediatric stroke. However, most population-based studies on
      pediatric stroke were from Europe or North America, and there was a lack of data 
      on the incidence of stroke among Chinese or Asian children. Whether the etiologic
      patterns and risk factors for death and morbidity among Chinese children with
      stroke were similar to those described for other ethnic groups was unknown.
      OBJECTIVES: To calculate the incidence of stroke among Chinese children in Hong
      Kong and to examine the clinical spectrum, causes, patterns, risk factors, and
      outcomes of pediatric stroke among Chinese subjects. METHODS: The population of
      Hong Kong was 6.7 million in 2001, and >98% of our population is Chinese in
      origin. In Hong Kong, public hospitals under the Hospital Authority provide >95% 
      of the hospital service for the region. We identified children (>1 month to <15
      years of age) who were admitted and given a discharge diagnosis of stroke from
      the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System, which is a centralized
      computerized database for all public hospitals. The discharge coding of stroke
      used codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,
      Clinical Modification. Only first admissions during the study period were
      included. We excluded any subsequent admissions by using multiple demographic
      characteristics of the patients. The incidence of pediatric stroke was estimated 
      as the number of first hospitalizations divided by the person-years at risk.
      Since 1991, we had been collecting a database on pediatric stroke (ages of 1
      month to 16 years) from a single center (the university-affiliated pediatric
      unit). The clinical presentation, causes, risk factors, and outcomes for those in
      the Hong Kong Children's Stroke Registry with follow-up data for > or =2 years
      were analyzed. Data on outcomes, in terms of survival and neurologic deficits,
      were studied. For survivors, neurologic deficits were defined as short-term if
      they resolved within 3 months and long-term if they persisted for >3 months. The 
      severity of deficits was defined as mild when function was minimally affected and
      the patient remained independent in activities of daily living, moderate when the
      patient required supervision or partial assistance in activities of daily living 
      or when the deficit caused delay in developmental milestones, and severe when the
      patient required total or near-total care in activities of daily living.
      Potential risk factors for death and poor neurologic outcomes, including gender, 
      age at the time of stroke, clinical presentation, causes, and neuroimaging
      findings, were analyzed. RESULTS: Using projections from census data in 2001, the
      number of children <15 years of age in Hong Kong from 1998 to 2001 was estimated 
      to be 1,104100 to 1,158800, resulting in 4,545300 person-years. During the same
      period, 94 children with discharge coding of stroke were identified. Therefore,
      the estimated incidence of pediatric stroke between 1998 and 2001 was 2.1 cases
      per 100,000 children-years. The average number of new cases treated annually was 
      4.5 (0-15 cases/year). Fifty children (28 boys and 22 girls; male/female ratio:
      1.27:1) were identified in the 11-year period. The mean age at presentation was
      5.6 +/- 4.9 years. Thirty-six strokes (72%) were ischemic and 14 (28%) were
      hemorrhagic. Despite evaluation for possible underlying causes, 12% (6 cases)
      remained idiopathic. Eighteen patients with ischemic strokes had cerebral
      thrombosis, whereas 15 had cerebral embolism. We did not observe any case of
      sinovenous thrombosis. The 36 cases of ischemic stroke were subtyped according to
      vascular territories. Eleven cases had infarction involving the middle cerebral
      artery territory; 2 were limited to the cortical region, 3 were limited to
      subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia or internal capsule or both, and
      6 had complete middle cerebral artery involvement, with cortical and subcortical 
      stroke. Involvement of the anterior cerebral artery occurred in 2 cases, with
      involvement of cerebellar/basilar artery territories in another 2 cases. The
      remaining 15 cases had multiple sites of infarction. Three patients experienced
      secondary hemorrhagic transformation after the initial thrombotic event. Of the
      14 patients with hemorrhagic strokes, only 1 had subarachnoid hemorrhage. All
      others had intracerebral bleeding, at single (N = 9) or multiple (N = 4) loci.
      Important causes included complications related to congenital heart diseases (N =
      15, 30%), vascular diseases (N = 13, 26%), and hematologic diseases (N = 14,
      28%). Six cases had no determined causes. One case involved mitochondrial
      encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and constituted the 
      only case with a metabolic cause. For the 7 patients for whom prothrombotic
      screening was performed, findings were negative. Seizures (52%) and hemiplegia
      (34%) were the most common presenting features. Other presenting clinical
      features included headaches (22%), decreased consciousness (30%), visual field
      defects (12%), dysphasia (10%), and lethargy (8%). Only 1 patient, with moyamoya 
      disease, had a family history of stroke. The median follow-up time was 8.7 years 
      (range: 2-12.4 years). Nine patients (18%) died, 5 with ischemic stroke and 4
      with hemorrhagic stroke. Among the 5 cases of death with ischemic stroke, 3
      involved hemorrhagic transformation before death. Seven patients (77%) died
      within 31 days (range: 2-31 days), whereas the other 2 died 6 months and 2.5
      years after the episode. Recurrence occurred in 5 cases (10%). Long-term
      neurologic deficits occurred among 41% of survivors, including mental retardation
      (N = 11), epilepsy (N = 7), and hemiplegia (N = 10). The functional deficits were
      classified as severe in 7 cases, moderate in 3 cases, and mild in 7 cases, for
      patients with long-term neurologic deficits. Decreased levels of consciousness,
      hematologic causes, and hemorrhagic transformation (applicable only in ischemic
      stroke) were significant risk factors associated with high mortality rates. For
      the 41 patients who survived, the only significant risk factor for long-term
      neurologic deficits was seizures at the initial presentation. Other factors, such
      as gender, age, other clinical features, stroke type, vascular territory, other
      causes, and recurrence of stroke, were all insignificant for both death and
      long-term deficits. The 3 risk factors identified for death were analyzed in
      multivariate logistic regression analyses, with adjustment for the confounding
      variables, and only decreased levels of consciousness remained significant (odds 
      ratio = 15.6). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of stroke among Chinese children was
      slightly lower than that in Europe or North America. The etiologic pattern was
      different in our cohort, and there was no sickle cell anemia, thrombophilia, or
      sinovenous thrombosis. Despite these differences, however, mortality and
      long-term neurologic deficit rates were similar.

TI  - Hemispheric, attentional, and processing speed factors in the treatment of
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 341-8
AB  - Aim of the study is to analyze the contributions of hemispheric, attentional, and
      processing speed factors to the effects of neuropsychological treatment of
      developmental dyslexia. Four groups of dyslexic children (M-type dyslexia) were
      treated over a period of four months. A first group (n = 9) underwent Bakker's
      Hemisphere-Specific Stimulation, with presentation of words in the right and left
      visual field. A second group (n = 7) received the same stimuli randomly in either
      visual hemifield. A third group (n = 8) received the same words presented
      centrally at fixation point. A fourth group (n = 6) received central stimuli with
      fixed presentation time (1500 ms). The children were tested before and after
      treatment on reading and spelling measures. All groups improved significantly
      after treatment on all variables. However, the group that was treated with
      centrally presented stimuli improved more than the other groups in spelling
      measures. A possible explanation is that rapid, simultaneous presentation to both
      hemispheres enhances interhemispheric exchange, which could produce an advantage 
      in tasks requiring a high degree of integration between left and right
      hemispheric functions, such as spelling. The absence of significant differences
      in reading improvement may point to the role of memory functions or strategic
      factors characterizing all the treatment programs, possibly overweighing the
      effect of the other factors.

TI  - Length effect in reading and lexical decision: evidence from skilled readers and 
      a developmental dyslexic participant.
PG  - 332-40
AB  - A number of experimental data have shown that naming latency increases with
      length for pseudo-words but not for frequent real words. Different
      interpretations have been proposed by current models of reading to account for
      such a length effect. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of
      lexicality on length effect in both the reading and lexical decision tasks. For
      this purpose, skilled readers were asked to either name or make a lexical
      decision on words and pseudo-words differing in length from one to three
      syllables. Skilled readers' results show that length effect is modulated by
      lexicality in the reading task but no length effect was found in the lexical
      decision task. The tasks were further proposed to a well-compensated dyslexic
      participant who exhibited a visual attentional disorder in the absence of any
      associated phonological problems. A length effect on RTs was found for both words
      and pseudo-words in lexical decision but naming latencies were affected by length
      for the pseudo-words only. The present results largely conform to the predictions
      of the ACV98 model of reading. They are not compatible with the PDP models of
      reading and can only be partially accounted for by dual route models.

TI  - Specific impairment in developmental reading disabilities: a working memory
      approach.
PG  - 349-63
AB  - Children with developmental reading disabilities (RD) frequently display impaired
      working memory functioning. However, research has been divergent regarding the
      characteristics of the deficit. Our investigation addressed this controversy by
      assessing Baddeley's working memory model as a whole rather than focusing on
      particular aspects of it, as has been done by much of the research to date.
      Participants included 20 children with RD and 20 typical readers between the ages
      of 9 and 13. The phonological loop, visual-spatial sketchpad, and central
      executive were assessed according to Baddeley's model. The results demonstrated
      that children with RD have an impaired phonological loop but intact
      visual-spatial sketchpad and central executive functioning as compared to
      controls. In terms of the phonological loop, the deficit appears to be specific
      to the phonological store. Furthermore, our research supports a relationship
      between phonological processing and phonological loop functioning.

TI  - Construction of an Arabic reading test for assessment of dyslexic children.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dyslexia is a specific language-based disorder of constitutional
      origin, characterized by difficulties in phonological processing. The Arabic
      language differs in many aspects from foreign languages and the few previously
      designed Arabic tests for assessment of dyslexia did not pay attention to
      phonological awareness problems. This necessitates the design of an Arabic test
      which could properly assign specific difficulties among Arabic reading dyslexic
      children, including phonological awareness as a major contributing factor for
      dyslexia. METHODS: The study was carried out in Assiut City, Egypt, during the
      period from September 1999 to the end of January 2001. The newly designed Arabic 
      Reading Test (ART) in this work passed through many stages. Firstly, test
      construction by 11 Arabic teachers (specific judges). Secondly it was applied, in
      a pilot study, to 50 normal students (9-10 years old) to ascertain clarity of the
      test. Then test standardization was proven through application on a second sample
      (n=252 students), and third sample (n=58 dyslexics). RESULTS: The reliability of 
      the ART was proven by the test-retest method (r=0.913, p<0.01). Validity was
      proven by judgment validity, internal consistency validity (ranged from 0.238 for
      auditory perception to 0.940 for phonological awareness and spelling), contrasted
      group validity, and criterion related validity (in relation to Schonell r=0.859, 
      Awaad reading r=0.817, Awaad comprehension r=671, mid-term Arabic scores
      r=0.686). CONCLUSION: The ART was thus proven to be highly reliable, and valid
      for assessment of dyslexia among Arabic reading children. It has great value in
      predicting dyslexia even among preschool age Arabic speaking children, through
      assessment of their phonological awareness skills, and thus, remediation programs
      can be properly and early directed.

      there is little agreement as to their cause. New evidence from behavioral
      measures of the ability to hear tones in the presence of background noise
      indicates that the brains of affected individuals develop more slowly than those 
      of their unaffected counterparts. In addition, it seems that brain changes
      occurring at approximately 10 years of age, presumably associated with puberty,
      may prematurely halt this slower-than-normal development when improvements would 
      normally continue into adolescence. The combination of these ideas can account
      for a wide range of previous results, suggesting that delayed brain development, 
      and its interaction with puberty, may be key factors contributing to learning
      problems.

TI  - Deficits in beat perception and dyslexia: evidence from French.
PG  - 1255-9
AB  - Recent research has suggested a novel link between deficits in the perception of 
      cues relevant to speech rhythm (i.e., deficits in amplitude envelope rise time
      processing, or beat perception) and the phonological deficits seen in most
      dyslexic children. In this research, we investigated whether these beat
      perception deficits were specific to a stress-timed language, such as English, or
      whether they would generalize to languages with different rhythmic properties,
      such as French. Eighteen dyslexics, 18 reading level controls, and 20
      chronological age controls were tested on a battery of phonological tasks,
      reading tasks and psychoacoustic tests. The results suggest that deficits in the 
      perception of cues important for speech rhythm may be universal in developmental 
      dyslexia.

TI  - Morphological awareness in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 114-38
AB  - This study examines morphological awareness in developmental dyslexia. While the 
      poor phonological awareness of dyslexic children has been related to their
      difficulty in handling the alphabetical principle, less is known about their
      morphological awareness, which also plays an important part in reading
      development. The aim of this study was to analyze in more detail the implications
      of the phonological impairments of dyslexics in dealing with larger units of
      language such as morphemes. First, the performance of dyslexic children in a
      series of morphological tasks was compared with the performance of children
      matched on reading-level and chronological age. In all the tasks, the dyslexic
      group performed below the chronological age control group, suggesting that
      morphological awareness cannot be developed entirely independently of reading
      experience and/or phonological skills. Comparisons with the reading-age control
      group indicated that, while the dyslexic children were poorer in the morphemic
      segmentation tasks, they performed normally for their reading level in the
      sentence completion tasks. Furthermore, they produced more derived words in the
      production task. This suggests that phonological impairments prevent the explicit
      segmentation of affixes while allowing the development of productive
      morphological knowledge. A second study compared dyslexic subgroups defined by
      their degree of phonological impairment. Our results suggest that dyslexics
      develop a certain type of morphological knowledge which they use as a
      compensatory reading strategy.

TI  - Development of auditory event-related potentials in young children and relations 
      to word-level reading abilities at age 8 years.
PG  - 9-38
AB  - A relationship between brain responses at birth and later emerging language and
      reading skills have been shown, but questions remains whether changes in brain
      responses after birth continue to predict the mastery of language-related skills 
      such as reading development. To determine whether developmental changes in the
      brain-based perceptual skills are systematically related to differences in
      word-level reading proficiency at age 8 years, brain event-related potentials
      (ERPs) to speech and non-speech stimuli were recorded annually at the ages of 1
      through 8 years in a sample of 109 typically developing children. Two measures of
      word-level reading (one that requires decoding of real words and one of
      pseudowords) were administered at age 8 years. Growth curve analysis, using the
      hierarchical linear models, related reading performance (average versus low) to
      the longitudinal maturation in the ERP waveform peak and latencies. Maturational 
      changes (e.g. slope, acceleration and cubic growth) in N1 amplitude from ages 1
      to 4 were related to proficiency in decoding pseudoword stimuli only, with
      children who were less proficient in decoding pseudowords evidencing more steeply
      negative declines in amplitude with age, particularly at the frontal and parietal
      recording sites in response to both speech and non-speech stimuli. In contrast,
      proficient in decoding real words was related to developmental changes in N2
      amplitudes from ages 4 to 8 only at the parietal recording site and only in
      response to non-speech stimuli. The early development of biologically-based
      differences in the perception and processing of auditory information contributes 
      to later group differences in reading proficiencies at school age.

TI  - Symbol-string sensitivity and children's reading.
PG  - 601-10
AB  - In this study of primary school children, a novel 'symbol-string' task is used to
      assess sensitivity to the position of briefly presented non-alphabetic but
      letter-like symbols. The results demonstrate that sensitivity in the
      symbol-string task explains a unique proportion of the variability in children's 
      contextual reading accuracy. Moreover, developmental dyslexic readers show
      reduced sensitivity in this task, compared to chronological age controls. The
      results suggest that limitations set by visuo-spatial processes and/or
      attentional iconic memory resources may constrain children's reading accuracy.

TI  - Large-scale neural correlates of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 125-40
AB  - Recent work in the field of developmental dyslexia has emphasized the large-scale
      neural aspects of the disorder as measured by means of contemporary imaging
      techniques, electrophysiology, and post-mortem analyses. This article presents
      findings from these research domains and comprehensively reviews their relevance 
      with respect to the behavioral and cognitive profiles of dyslexia. Large-scale
      alterations were observed in the perisylvian region across paradigms. Convergent 
      evidence has also been reported in terms of hemispheric balance. Specifically,
      deviances in cerebral asymmetry associated with atypical organization of the left
      hemisphere were found in both children and adults with dyslexia. Emerging
      research encompassing high-temporal resolution methods such as
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggests right-hemisphere involvement and points to 
      the complexity of the developmental disorder. A combined approach of structural
      imaging and MEG, and most importantly theory driven behavioral tasks may shed
      light on dynamics and trajectories of the neurobiology of dyslexia.

TI  - Contributions of memory circuits to language: the declarative/procedural model.
PG  - 231-70
AB  - The structure of the brain and the nature of evolution suggest that, despite its 
      uniqueness, language likely depends on brain systems that also subserve other
      functions. The declarative/procedural (DP) model claims that the mental lexicon
      of memorized word-specific knowledge depends on the largely temporal-lobe
      substrates of declarative memory, which underlies the storage and use of
      knowledge of facts and events. The mental grammar, which subserves the
      rule-governed combination of lexical items into complex representations, depends 
      on a distinct neural system. This system, which is composed of a network of
      specific frontal, basal-ganglia, parietal and cerebellar structures, underlies
      procedural memory, which supports the learning and execution of motor and
      cognitive skills, especially those involving sequences. The functions of the two 
      brain systems, together with their anatomical, physiological and biochemical
      substrates, lead to specific claims and predictions regarding their roles in
      language. These predictions are compared with those of other neurocognitive
      models of language. Empirical evidence is presented from neuroimaging studies of 
      normal language processing, and from developmental and adult-onset disorders. It 
      is argued that this evidence supports the DP model. It is additionally proposed
      that "language" disorders, such as specific language impairment and non-fluent
      and fluent aphasia, may be profitably viewed as impairments primarily affecting
      one or the other brain system. Overall, the data suggest a new neurocognitive
      framework for the study of lexicon and grammar.

TI  - Two visual motion processing deficits in developmental dyslexia associated with
      different reading skills deficits.
PG  - 528-40
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is associated with deficits in the processing of visual
      motion stimuli, and some evidence suggests that these motion processing deficits 
      are related to various reading subskills deficits. However, little is known about
      the mechanisms underlying such associations. This study lays a richer groundwork 
      for exploration of such mechanisms by more comprehensively and rigorously
      characterizing the relationship between motion processing deficits and reading
      subskills deficits. Thirty-six adult participants, 19 of whom had a history of
      developmental dyslexia, completed a battery of visual, cognitive, and reading
      tests. This battery combined motion processing and reading subskills measures
      used across previous studies and added carefully matched visual processing
      control tasks. Results suggest that there are in fact two distinct motion
      processing deficits in developmental dyslexia, rather than one as assumed by
      previous research, and that each of these deficits is associated with a different
      type of reading subskills deficit. A deficit in detecting coherent motion is
      selectively associated with low accuracy on reading subskills tests, and a
      deficit in discriminating velocities is selectively associated with slow
      performance on these same tests. In addition, evidence from visual processing
      control tasks as well as self-reports of ADHD symptoms suggests that these motion
      processing deficits are specific to the domain of visual motion, and result
      neither from a broader visual deficit, nor from the sort of generalized attention
      deficit commonly comorbid with developmental dyslexia. Finally, dissociation
      between these two motion processing deficits suggests that they may have distinct
      neural and functional underpinnings. The two distinct patterns of motion
      processing and reading deficits demonstrated by this study may reflect separable 
      underlying neurocognitive mechanisms of developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1451-60
AB  - Developmental dyslexia, or specific reading disability, is a disorder in which
      children with normal intelligence and sensory abilities show learning deficits
      for reading. Substantial evidence has established its biological origin and the
      preponderance of phonological disorders even though important phenotypic
      variability and comorbidity have been recorded. Diverse theories have been
      proposed to account for the cognitive and neurological aspects of dyslexia.
      Findings of genetic studies show that different loci affect specific reading
      disability although a direct relation has not been established between symptoms
      and a given genomic locus. In both children and adults with dyslexia, results of 
      neuroimaging studies suggest defective activity and abnormal connectivity between
      regions crucial for language functions--eg, the left fusiform gyrus for
      reading--and changes in brain activity associated with performance improvement
      after various remedial interventions.

TI  - Sex differences in developmental reading disability: new findings from 4
      epidemiological studies.
PG  - 2007-12
AB  - CONTEXT: An influential article published in 1990 claimed that the increased rate
      of reading disability in boys was a consequence of referral bias. OBJECTIVES: To 
      summarize the history of research on sex differences in reading disability and to
      provide new evidence from 4 independent epidemiological studies about the nature,
      extent, and significance of sex differences in reading disability. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development
      Study comprised 989 individuals (52.1% male) in a cohort born between April 1972 
      and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, and followed up from age 3 years; reading
      performance and IQ were assessed at ages 7, 9, and 11 years using the Burt Word
      Reading Test and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R),
      respectively. The Christchurch Health and Development Study comprised 895
      individuals (50% male) in a prospectively studied cohort born in the
      Christchurch, New Zealand, region during a 4-month period in 1977; reading
      performance and IQ were assessed at ages 8 to 10 years using the Burt Word
      Reading Test and the WISC-R. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) Study
      comprised a UK nationally representative sample of 5752 children (50.1% male)
      aged 9 to 15 years in 1999; reading was assessed on the British Ability Scales II
      and IQ on the British Picture Vocabulary Scales II. The Environmental Risk
      Longitudinal Twin Study (E-Risk) comprised 2163 twin children from England and
      Wales (49.1% male) identified at birth in 1994 and 1995 and included
      administration of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency at age 7 years and the
      Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised as a test of IQ at
      age 5 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reading performance by sex in the lowest 15%
      of the distribution for all 4 studies, with and without taking IQ into account.
      RESULTS: In all 4 studies, the rates of reading disability were significantly
      higher in boys. For non-IQ-referenced reading disability: Dunedin study, 21.6% in
      boys vs 7.9% in girls (odds ratio [OR], 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      2.15-4.17); Christchurch study, 20.6% in boys vs 9.8% in girls (OR, 2.38; 95% CI,
      1.62-3.50); ONS study, 17.6% in boys vs 13.0% in girls (OR, 1.43; 95% CI,
      1.23-1.65); and E-Risk, 18.0% in boys vs 13.0% in girls (OR, 1.39; 95% CI,
      1.04-1.86). The rates for IQ-referenced reading disabilities were similar.
      CONCLUSION: Reading disabilities are clearly more frequent in boys than in girls.

TI  - The fragile nature of the speech-perception deficit in dyslexia: natural vs
      synthetic speech.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - A number of studies reported that developmental dyslexics are impaired in speech 
      perception, especially for speech signals consisting of rapid auditory
      transitions. These studies mostly made use of a categorical-perception task with 
      synthetic-speech samples. In this study, we show that deficits in the perception 
      of synthetic speech do not generalise to the perception of more naturally
      sounding speech, even if the same experimental paradigm is used. This contrasts
      with the assumption that dyslexics are impaired in the perception of rapid
      auditory transitions.

TI  - Developmental neglect dyslexia in a Hebrew-reading child.
PG  - 301-13
AB  - This paper describes for the first time a detailed study of a child with neglect 
      dyslexia. NT is 10-year-old child, with left word-based neglect dyslexia, without
      clinical signs of visuo-spatial neglect. Since he is a native speaker of Hebrew, 
      which is read from right to left, his neglect dyslexia manifests in omissions and
      substitutions of final letters. He is severely impaired in single words, with 96%
      of his errors being omissions and substitutions of final letters. When presented 
      with more than one word, in word pairs, sentences or text, he neglects the left
      part of each word, but never omit whole words on the left side of the page. His
      reading improves considerably when the same word is presented vertically or when 
      manipulations are done to shift his attention to the left--with coloured final
      letters, flashing light, or tapping his finger to the left of each word. NT's
      neglect dyslexia is very selective, with good reading of numbers and symbols, and
      even good performance on letter sequences when no reading is required. A
      dissociation is also detected between his impaired reading due to neglect
      dyslexia and his normal performance on conventional clinical tests of general
      visual neglect visual of line, object and letter cancellation, line bisection,
      object drawing and copying. His neglect dyslexia seems to be developmental as no 
      abrupt onset is reported.

TI  - Fine mapping of the 2p11 dyslexia locus and exclusion of TACR1 as a candidate
      gene.
PG  - 510-6
AB  - Developmental dyslexia, or reading disability, is a multigenic complex disease
      for which at least five loci, i.e. DYX1-3 and DYX5-6, have been clearly
      identified from the human genome. To date, DYX1C1 is the only dyslexia candidate 
      gene cloned. We have previously reported linkage to 2p11 and 7q32 in 11 Finnish
      pedigrees. Here, we report the fine mapping of the approximately 40-cM linked
      region from chromosome 2 as we increased marker density to one per 1.8 cM.
      Linkage was supported with the highest NPL score of 3.0 (P=0.001) for marker
      D2S2216. Association analysis using the six pedigrees showing linkage pointed to 
      marker D2S286/rs3220265 (P value <0.001) in the near vicinity of D2S2216. We went
      on to further characterise this approximately 15-cM candidate region
      (D2S2110-D2S2181) by adding six SNPs covering approximately 670 kb centred at
      D2S286/rs3220265. A haplotype pattern could no longer be observed in this region,
      which was therefore excluded from the candidate area. This also excluded the
      TACR1 (tachykinin receptor 1) gene, located at marker D2S286. The dyslexia
      candidate region on 2p11 is, therefore, now limited to the chromosomal area
      D2S2116-D2S2181, which is approximately 12 Mbp of human sequence and is at a
      distinct location from the previously reported DYX3 locus, raising the
      possibility of two distinct loci on chromosome 2p.

TI  - A cognitive-behavioral intervention program for students with special reading
      disabilities.
PG  - 587-93
AB  - Interaction among cognitive, meta-cognitive, and emotional factors seems to play 
      a determining part in achievement behavior and especially in scholastic
      performance. In this study some preliminary results are presented of the
      implementation of a multidimensional cognitive-behavioral psychoeducational
      program especially designed for students with reading disabilities in which
      parents and teachers also take part. The aim of the program was to provide
      students with appropriate emotional and cognitive skills with which to address
      their learning problems. First results on the efficacy of the implemented program
      to 20 primary school boys and girls with special reading disabilities encourage
      research on management of learning problems with focus on cognitive and emotional
      aspects in which parents and teachers contribute. Research including a control
      group is necessary.

TI  - Clinical trials of fatty acid treatment in ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia and the
      autistic spectrum.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - Considerable clinical and experimental evidence now supports the idea that
      deficiencies or imbalances in certain highly unsaturated fatty acids may
      contribute to a range of common developmental disorders including ADHD, dyslexia,
      dyspraxia and autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Definitive evidence of a causal 
      contribution, however, can only come from intervention studies in the form of
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Published studies of this
      kind are still fairly few in number, and mainly involve the diagnostic categories
      of ADHD and dyslexia, although other trials involving individuals with dyspraxia 
      or ASD are in progress. The main findings to date from such studies are reviewed 
      and evaluated here with the primary aim of guiding future research, although
      given that fatty acid supplementation for these conditions is already being
      adopted in many quarters, it is hoped that some of the information provided may
      also help to inform clinical practice.

PG  - 368-94
AB  - This article presents a new model of transcoding numbers from verbal to arabic
      form. This model, called ADAPT, is developmental, asemantic, and procedural. The 
      authors' main proposal is that the transcoding process shifts from an algorithmic
      strategy to the direct retrieval from memory of digital forms. Thus, the model is
      evolutive, adaptive, and particularly suited to account for learning and
      development. ADAPT, which has been implemented in a computer program, accounts
      for existing and new developmental data, for new data in adolescents with mild
      retardation, and for the neuropsychological cases described in the literature.

TI  - Characteristics of writing disorders in Italian dyslexic children.
PG  - 18-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study characterizes the spelling impairment of Italian dyslexic
      children and evaluates the relationship between reading and spelling disorders.
      BACKGROUND: Developmental spelling deficits are much less investigated than
      reading deficits. Based on the dual-model approach, studies of English-speaking
      subjects describe a surface and a phonological dysgraphia. In languages with
      shallow orthographies, there is evidence of surface and phonological dyslexia,
      but no data are available for dysgraphia. METHODS: Eighteen dyslexic children
      were studied. Writing was investigated by means of a spelling test that included 
      regular words with one-sound-to-one-letter correspondence, regular words
      requiring syllabic conversion rules, words with unpredictable transcription, and 
      nonwords with one-sound-to-one-letter correspondence. The dyslexics' spelling
      errors were compared with those of 30 age-matched proficient readers. RESULTS:
      The dyslexic participants were very slow readers. Their errors were compatible
      with the hypothesis of a prevalent use of the sublexical reading procedure (i.e.,
      surface dyslexia). They were also generally impaired with respect to the control 
      children in all subsections of the spelling test. However, multivariate and
      single case analyses as well as qualitative analysis of errors indicated that
      their major problem was writing words with unpredictable transcription. This
      failure was consistent with the view of prevalent subword level processing in
      writing. CONCLUSION: The pattern of the spelling impairment mirrors the
      children's reading impairment, with most children suffering from surface
      dysgraphia.

TI  - Pleiotropic effects of a chromosome 3 locus on speech-sound disorder and reading.
PG  - 283-97
AB  - Speech-sound disorder (SSD) is a complex behavioral disorder characterized by
      speech-sound production errors associated with deficits in articulation,
      phonological processes, and cognitive linguistic processes. SSD is prevalent in
      childhood and is comorbid with disorders of language, spelling, and reading
      disability, or dyslexia. Previous research suggests that developmental problems
      in domains associated with speech and language acquisition place a child at risk 
      for dyslexia. Recent genetic studies have identified several candidate regions
      for dyslexia, including one on chromosome 3 segregating in a large Finnish
      pedigree. To explore common genetic influences on SSD and reading, we examined
      linkage for several quantitative traits to markers in the pericentrometric region
      of chromosome 3 in 77 families ascertained through a child with SSD. The
      quantitative scores measured several processes underlying speech-sound
      production, including phonological memory, phonological representation,
      articulation, receptive and expressive vocabulary, and reading decoding and
      comprehension skills. Model-free linkage analysis was followed by identification 
      of sib pairs with linkage and construction of core shared haplotypes. In our
      multipoint analyses, measures of phonological memory demonstrated the strongest
      linkage (marker D3S2465, P=5.6 x 10(-5), and marker D3S3716, P=6.8 x 10(-4)).
      Tests for single-word decoding also demonstrated linkage (real word reading:
      marker D3S2465, P=.004; nonsense word reading: marker D3S1595, P=.005). The
      minimum shared haplotype in sib pairs with similar trait values spans 4.9 cM and 
      is bounded by markers D3S3049 and D3S3045. Our results suggest that domains
      common to SSD and dyslexia are pleiotropically influenced by a putative
      quantitative trait locus on chromosome 3.

TI  - Cognitive profiling and preliminary subtyping in Chinese developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 43-75
AB  - The present study examined the cognitive profile and subtypes of developmental
      dyslexia in a nonalphabetic script, Chinese. One hundred and forty-seven Chinese 
      primary school children with developmental dyslexia were tested on a number of
      literacy and cognitive tasks. The results showed that rapid naming deficit and
      orthographic deficit were the two most dominant types of cognitive deficits in
      Chinese developmental dyslexia, and that rapid naming and orthographic processing
      had significant unique contributions to literacy performance. Seven subtypes of
      dyslexia--global deficit, orthographic deficit, phonological memory deficit, mild
      difficulty, and three other subtypes with rapid-naming-related deficits--were
      identified using scores of the cognitive tasks as classification measures in
      cluster analyses. These subtypes were validated with a behaviour checklist and
      three literacy measures. The authors suggested that orthographic and rapid naming
      deficits in Chinese dyslexic children might pose an interrelated problem in
      developing orthographic knowledge and representation. Therefore,
      orthographic-related difficulties may be the crux of the problem in Chinese
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Familial cancer and developmental dyslexia: an observational pilot study.
PG  - 119-27
AB  - The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that raised platelet-activating
      factor (PAF) may contribute to the aetiology of developmental dyslexia. PAF is a 
      potent proinflammatory mediator which signals cell damage and facilitates natural
      killer cell activity. Raised PAF may help protect against tumourigenesis. As
      dyslexia has a partial genetic basis, the PAF hypothesis predicts that dyslexia
      may be negatively associated with a family history of cancer. To test this
      prediction, children with dyslexia (n=163) and children without dyslexia (n=154),
      with (n=152) and without (n=165) a family history of cancer (total n=317; mean
      age 11 years 5 months, SD 2 years 11 months), were compared on standard
      psychometrics (British Ability Scales subtests). Results showed that
      proportionately fewer children with dyslexia (38%) than controls (58.4%) had a
      family history of cancer, and there was some evidence of a 'dose' effect:
      children who had more relatives with cancer showed better reading and spelling.
      It was concluded that children at genetic risk of dyslexia who have a family
      history of cancer have better reading and spelling than those without a family
      history of cancer, confirming the prediction of the PAF hypothesis.

TI  - Adults with dyslexia show deficits on spatial frequency doubling and visual
      attention tasks.
PG  - 24-43
AB  - We examine the visual processing of high-functioning adults with developmental
      dyslexia (mean Performance IQ = 126.5) and current phonological problems. In
      comparison to an age- and IQ-matched control group, the group with dyslexia
      showed deficits in two tasks associated with magnocellular/dorsal pathway
      function. For the 'frequency doubling' stimulus (grating of 0.25 cpd modulated at
      25 Hz counterphase flicker), contrast thresholds for detection were raised in the
      dyslexic group. In conjunction visual search, a display time sufficient for
      controls to achieve ceiling accuracy at all set sizes (30 ms per item) was
      inadequate to allow shifts of attention around the display for the group with
      dyslexia. In contrast, normal performance was found on 'popout' visual search and
      on a ventral stream acuity task. Correlational analysis revealed a significant
      relationship between degree of deficit in conjunction search and phonological
      difficulty. The deficits revealed were specific to functions that rely on
      magnocellular input. They cannot be attributed to concentration lapses, eye
      movement problems or slow reaction times in the dyslexic group.

TI  - Variation among developmental dyslexics: evidence from a printed-word-learning
      task.
PG  - 125-54
AB  - A word-learning task was used to investigate variation among developmental
      dyslexics classified as phonological and surface dyslexics. Dyslexic children and
      chronological age (CA)- and reading level (RL)-matched normal readers were taught
      to pronounce novel nonsense words such as veep. Words were assigned either a
      regular (e.g., "veep") or an irregular (e.g., "vip") pronunciation. Phonological 
      dyslexics learned both regular and exception words more slowly than the normal
      readers and, unlike the other groups, did not show a regular-word advantage.
      Surface dyslexics also learned regular and exception words more slowly than the
      CA group, consistent with a specific problem in mastering arbitrary item-specific
      pronunciations, but their performance resembled that of the RL group. The results
      parallel earlier findings from Manis, Seidenberg, Doi, McBride-Chang, & Petersen 
      [Cognition 58 (1996) 157-195] indicating that surface dyslexics and phonological 
      dyslexics have a different profile of reading deficits, with surface dyslexics
      resembling younger normal readers and phonological dyslexics showing a specific
      phonological deficit. Models of reading and reading disability need to account
      for the heterogeneity in reading processes among dyslexic children.

TI  - [Educational implications of the cognitive impairment in developmental dyslexia].
PG  - S47-52
AB  - AIMS: In this study we review the main theories put forward to account for
      developmental dyslexia, as well as the intervention procedures deriving from
      these theories that enjoy the most empirical support. DEVELOPMENT: Developmental 
      dyslexia is a complex disorder that reflects cognitive impairment related to
      neurobiological anomalies, although researchers still do not agree on fundamental
      aspects regarding its aetiology. There are at present a number of different
      theories that can be grouped in two antagonistic lines of work. On the one hand, 
      one of them considers that the exclusive and direct cause of dyslexia is a
      specific cognitive disorder. On the other hand, however, there are several
      theories that consider the impairments experienced by dyslexic patients to be
      part of a wide range of tasks and processes that are secondary to an underlying
      primary deficit. As a consequence of the progress made in the characterisation of
      dyslexia, an unprecedented effort has been made in recent decades in the
      development of intervention programmes and in the analysis of their
      effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Research into the explanation for dyslexia finds
      itself faced with the challenge of determining whether the different cognitive
      problems identified in dyslexic patients represent different cognitive routes
      towards the same dyslexic phenotype, whether they correspond to different types
      of dyslexia or whether they refer to the sum of the problems resulting from
      different comorbid conditions. Until this issue is resolved, as educators, we
      must carry out more comprehensive evaluations in order to determine the profile
      of the difficulties that are experienced in each particular case and to be able
      to tailor the interventions employed in this enigmatic problem.

TI  - The neural basis of hyperlexic reading: an FMRI case study.
PG  - 11-25
AB  - Children with autism spectrum disorders in very rare cases display surprisingly
      advanced "hyperlexic" reading skills. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), we studied the neural basis of this precocious reading ability in a
      9-year-old hyperlexic boy who reads 6 years in advance of his age. During covert 
      reading, he demonstrated greater activity in the left inferior frontal and
      superior temporal cortices than both chronological age- and reading age-matched
      controls. Activity in the right inferior temporal sulcus was greater when
      compared to reading age-matched controls. These findings suggest that precocious 
      reading is brought about by simultaneously drawing on both left hemisphere
      phonological and right hemisphere visual systems, reconciling the two prevailing,
      but seemingly contradictory, single hemisphere theories of hyperlexia. Hyperlexic
      reading is therefore associated with hyperactivation of the left superior
      temporal cortex, much in the same way as developmental dyslexia is associated
      with hypoactivation of this area.

TI  - Psychophysical indexes of temporal processing abnormalities in children with
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 321-54
AB  - Children with dyslexia and children progressing normally in reading performed
      several perceptual tasks to determine (a) the psychophysical measures that best
      differentiate children with dyslexia from children with average reading
      abilities; (b) the extent of temporal processing deficits in a single,
      well-defined group of children with dyslexia; and (c) the co-occurrence of visual
      and auditory temporal processing deficits in children with dyslexia. 4 of our 12 
      psychophysical tasks indicated differences in temporal processing ability between
      children with dyslexia and children with good reading skills. These included 2
      auditory tasks (dichotic pitch perception and FM tone discrimination) and 2
      visual tasks (global motion perception and contrast sensitivity). The battery of 
      12 tasks successfully classified 80% of the children into their respective
      reading-level groups. Within the group of children with dyslexia who had temporal
      processing deficits, most were affected in either audition or vision; few
      children were affected in both modalities. The observed deficits suggest that
      impaired temporal processing in dyslexia is most evident on tasks that require
      the ability to synthesize local, temporally modulated inputs into a global
      percept and the ability to extract the resultant global percept from a noisy
      environment.

TI  - Neuronal network models of ADHD -- lateralization with respect to
      interhemispheric connectivity reconsidered.
PG  - I71-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research on structural and functional anatomy related to ADHD 
      has concentrated on fronto-striatocerebellar circuits. These findings and
      resultant neurobiological models of ADHD may explain some of the disturbances. On
      the other hand, there is some evidence that the restricted look at
      anterior-posterior anomalies might neglect the important additional information
      of lateralization problems related to hemispheric connectivity. OBJECTIVE: Hence,
      the role of lateralization in the pathophysiology of ADHD should be reconsidered.
      METHOD: After a short review of imaging studies in ADHD the special role of the
      corpus callosum (including the influence of its anomalies on general brain
      development, lateralization and functioning) is outlined and the first case of
      total agenesis of corpus callosum in a child with ADHD is presented and discussed
      within this context. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the remaining inconsistencies
      concerning structural and functional brain anomalies in ADHD, attention should be
      paid not only to anterior- posterior but also to left-right aspects of functional
      and structural brain anomalies. This should include disturbances probably related
      to anomalies of the corpus callosum, especially in regard to co-existing problems
      like dyslexia and developmental coordination disorder.

      literacy skills.
PG  - 176-83
AB  - Children with developmental speech/language impairments are at higher risk for
      reading disability than typical peers with no history of speech/language
      impairment. This article reviews the literacy outcomes of children with
      speech/language impairments, clarifying the differential risk for three groups of
      children: speech production impairments alone, oral language impairments alone,
      and speech production and oral language impairments. Children at greatest risk
      for reading and writing disabilities are children with language impairments alone
      and children with comorbid speech impairments and language impairments. For
      children with speech impairments alone, there is limited risk for literacy
      difficulties. However, even when reading skills are within the average range,
      children with speech impairments may have difficulties in spelling. Children with
      language impairments are likely to display reading deficits in word decoding and 
      reading comprehension. It is not clear what role early literacy interventions
      play in the amelioration of reading difficulties in these populations.

TI  - Developmental amnesia: a new pattern of dissociation with intact episodic memory.
PG  - 764-81
AB  - A case of developmental amnesia is reported for a child, CL, of normal
      intelligence, who has intact episodic memory but impaired semantic memory for
      both semantic knowledge of facts and semantic knowledge of words, including
      general world knowledge, knowledge of word meanings and superordinate knowledge
      of words. In contrast to the deficits in semantic memory, there are no
      impairments in episodic memory for verbal or visual material, assessed by recall 
      or recognition. Lexical decision was also intact, indicating impairment in
      semantic knowledge of vocabulary rather than absence of lexical representations. 
      The case forms a double dissociation to the cases of Vargha-Khadem et al.
      [Science 277 (1997) 376; Episodic memory: new directions in research (2002) 153];
      Gadian et al. [Brain 123 (2000) 499] for whom semantic memory was intact but
      episodic memory was impaired. This double dissociation suggests that semantic
      memory and episodic memory have the capacity to develop separately and supports
      models of modularity within memory development and a functional architecture for 
      the developmental disorders within which there is residual normality rather than 
      pervasive abnormality. Knowledge of arithmetical facts is also spared for CL,
      consistent with adult studies arguing for numeracy knowledge distinct from other 
      semantics. Reading was characterised by difficulty with irregular words and
      homophones but intact reading of nonwords. CL has surface dyslexia with poor
      lexico-semantic reading skills but good phonological reading skills. The case was
      identified following screening from a population of normal schoolchildren
      suggesting that developmental amnesias may be more pervasive than has been
      recognised previously.

TI  - [Recurrent brain abscess associated with congenital pulmonary arteriovenous
      fistula: a case report].
PG  - 57-63
AB  - We report a rare case of recurrent brain abscess associated with congenital
      pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. A 52-year-old man was admitted to our hospital
      in October, 1999 because of a sudden stroke-like onset of right hemiparesis,
      right hemiparesthesia, dysarthria and sensory aphasia. He had a history of
      previous brain abscess in the right cerebellar hemisphere. It had been removed in
      1991. CT scan at the time of the current admission disclosed a low-density area
      in the left parietal region. The mass was ring-enhanced after injection of
      contrast medium. On MRI the mass lesion was depicted as low-intensity on
      T1-weighted image and high-intensity on T2-weighted image. The mass was
      ring-enhanced after administration of Gd-DTPA. In spite of conservative treatment
      the size of the abscess increased considerably with marked surrounding edema. The
      brain abscess was successfully treated with aspiration and drainage, and the
      residual mass was resected. The patient also had a history of arteriovenous
      fistula in the lower lobe of his right lung. This had been excised in 1965.
      However, he had no signs, symptoms or family histories of hereditary hemorrhagic 
      telangiectasia (Rendu-Osler-Weber disease). Contrast enhanced CT scan of the
      chest showed nodular lesions connected to vascular shadows in the right lower
      lung field. Pulmonary angiograms also revealed multiple arteriovenous fistulas in
      the lower lobe of the right lung. He was not dyspneic or cyanotic, but his
      hypoxia, polycythemia, and recurrent brain abscess were thought to be caused by
      pulmonary arteriovenous fistula. The fistulas were embolized with coils via a
      percutaneous catheter. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula should be treated
      aggressively either by surgery and/or by coil embolization in order to prevent
      the complication of brain abscess.

TI  - The prevalence of dyslexia and AD/HD in a sample of forensic psychiatric rapists.
PG  - 371-81
AB  - The prevalence of dyslexia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD)
      (DSM-IV) is markedly increased among those who are sentenced for criminal
      offences. The aim of the study was to identify developmental disabilities,
      dyslexia and AD/HD among severely disturbed men in forensic psychiatric care, and
      to study the co-occurrence of such disabilities, with the objective to discuss
      the importance of the diagnoses in forensic psychiatry. The participants were 10 
      males who had committed rape on adult women, and included two murder-rapists, one
      of which had murdered more than one victim (i.e. a serial murderer). All had been
      assigned to special long-term forensic psychiatric care, based predominantly on a
      psychodynamic ground. In order to be identified as having dyslexia, a
      participant's performance on at least three out of four tests of academic skills 
      had to be markedly below the expected level (more than two stanine steps), given 
      the participant's non-verbal intellectual capacity and considering the length of 
      his education. AD/HD was investigated by studying the participants' forensic
      psychiatric files and by a clinical interview. Seven of the 10 participants met
      the DSM-IV criteria for dyslexia, and six of them met the DSM-IV criteria for
      AD/HD. Four participants had AD/HD and dyslexia, three had AD/HD but no dyslexia,
      and two had dyslexia but no AD/HD. Only one participant had neither dyslexia nor 
      AD/HD. The participants with dyslexia performed well in tests assessing
      non-verbal reasoning, visuo-spatial capacity and visual memory. Although the
      generalization of the results from 10 rapists is severely limited, the results
      indicate the importance of assessing dyslexia as well as AD/HD in people who are 
      admitted for forensic psychiatric assessment. The lack of correct diagnoses may
      negatively influence the choice of appropriate forensic psychiatric care. Early
      assessment of those disorders might have a positive influence on the
      psychological development and socialization process in people with dyslexia
      and/or AD/HD.

TI  - From superior adaptation and function to brain dysfunction--the neglect of
      epigenetic factors.
PG  - 3-27
AB  - With optimal pregnancy conditions (natural, enriched diet which includes fish)
      African (Digo) infants are 3-4 weeks ahead of European/American infants in
      sensorimotor terms at birth, and during the first year. Infants of semi-aquatic
      sea-gypsies swim before they walk, and have superior visual acuity compared with 
      us. With adverse pregnancy behaviour (fear of fat, a trend to dieting),
      neglecting the need for brain fat to secure normal brain development and
      function, we run a risk of dysfunction--death. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
      victims have depressed birth weight, lower levels of marine fat in brainstem than
      controls, and >80 suffer multiple hypoxic episodes prior to death. Depressed
      birth weight (more than 10% below mean) is seen in learning and behaviour
      disorders, and a trend towards weights of less than 3kg is increasing, which
      supports a rise in antenatal sub optimality. Given marine fat deficiency in
      pregnancy and infancy, neurons starved for fuel could delay myelination and
      maturation in the latest developed Frontal Lobes. The phylogenetic oldest Lateral
      Frontal Lobe System (feed-back mechanism etc.) derived from olfactory
      bulb-amygdala, which crosses in Anterior Commisure is probably spared, while the 
      Medial Frontal Lobe System derived from Hippocampus-Cingulum and crosses in
      Corpus Callosum (delayed response task) is most likely affected. The rise in
      infantile autism (intact vision and hearing) with deficit in delayed response
      task only, could suggest a deficit in the Medial Frontal Lobe System. The human
      species is unique; 70% of total energy to the foetus goes to development of the
      brain, which mainly consists of marine fat. It undergoes pervasive regressive
      events, before birth, in infancy and at puberty. Minimal retraction of neuronal
      arborisation is advantageous. Attributable to adverse pregnancy childrearing
      practice, excessive retraction is likely prenatally and in infancy. Pubertal age 
      affects the fundamental property of nervous tissue, excitability: excessive
      excitatory drive is seen in early, and a deficiency in late puberty. It is
      postulated that with adequate marine fat, there is probably no risk of
      psychopathology at the extremes, whereas a deficiency could lead to paroxysmal
      (subcortical) dysfunction in early puberty, and breakdown of cortical circuitry
      and cognitive dysfunctions in late puberty. The post-pubertal psychoses,
      schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis at the extremes of the pubertal age 
      continuum, with contrasting excitability and biological treatment, are probably
      the result of continuous dietary deficiency, which has inactivated the expression
      of genes for myelin development and oligodendrocyte-related genes in their
      production of myelin. The beneficial effect of marine fat in both disorders, in
      other CNS disorders as well as in developmental dyslexia (DD) and ADHD among
      others, supports our usual diet is persistently deficient. We have neglected the 
      similarity of our great brain to other mammals, and our marine heritage. Given
      the amount of marine fat needed to secure normal brain development and function
      is not known, nor the present dietary level, it seems unduly conjectural to
      postulate that a dietary deficiency in marine fat is causing brain dysfunction
      and death. However, all observations point in the same direction: our diet
      focusing on protein mainly, is deficient, the deficiency is most pronounced in
      maternal nutrition and in infancy.

TI  - Bronchogenic cysts: a rare congenital cystic malformation of the lung.
PG  - 573-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital cystic malformations of the lung.
      We retrospectively analyzed ten cases of bronchogenic cyst (BC) to reinforce the 
      importance of recognizing this malformation. METHODS: Between 1985 and 2000, ten 
      pediatric patients with BC were treated surgically in our department. Their
      clinical presentation, radiological, operative, and pathological findings were
      analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were five boys and five girls, ranging
      in age from 16 days to 6 years (mean 6.5 months). The clinical signs and symptoms
      included respiratory distress in seven patients (70%), cyanosis in four (40%),
      chronic cough and fever in five (50%), and dysphasia in two (20%). Routine chest 
      X-ray revealed a pulmonary air-filled cyst in six patients (60%) and a pulmonary 
      nodular opacity in four (40%). The diagnosis was supported by computed tomography
      in four patients and by ultrasonography in two. Eight of the patients were
      treated by cyst excision and two by lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis made
      from all specimens was bronchogenic cyst, with squamous metaplasia in two.
      CONCLUSION: In newborns, infants, and even children, the development of dyspnea, 
      cyanosis, chronic cough, and fever should alert us to the suspicion of a cystic
      malformation in the lung, such as a bronchogenic cyst, especially if an
      air-filled cyst is seen on a plain chest X-ray.

TI  - Children with dyslexia: evidence for visual attention deficits in perception of
      rapid sequences of objects.
PG  - 2521-35
AB  - The attentional blink (AB) refers to a decrease in accuracy that occurs when
      observers are required to identify, detect or classify the second of two
      rapidly-sequential targets. The AB is typically attributed to an inability to
      rapidly reallocate attentional resources from the first to the second target.
      Thus, it provides an ideal tool to investigate how visual attention is rapidly
      allocated to sequences of stimuli such as occurs when reading. In the present
      work, we compared the magnitude of the AB in children with developmental dyslexia
      to reading-matched and age-matched control groups. In Experiment 1, when two
      targets were presented in the same spatial location, the AB deficit was similar
      in the reading-matched and dyslexic groups, but greater in the dyslexic group
      than in age-matched controls. In Experiment 2, when targets were presented in
      different spatial locations, performance in the dyslexic group was worse than the
      age-matched controls and marginally worse than the reading-matched controls.
      Taken together, the results argue for developmental delays in the ability of
      children with dyslexia to allocate attention to rapidly-sequential stimuli, as
      well as some evidence for difficulties that are unique to this group.

TI  - Fifty years of the double helix and its impact on psychiatry.
PG  - 657-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the impact of Watson and Crick's double helix discovery on 
      the field of psychiatry. METHOD: Psychiatric research studies using molecular
      genetic techniques are summarized. The implications of these findings in terms of
      our understanding and treatment of mental illness are discussed. RESULTS: There
      now exists growing evidence of candidate gene sites for a variety of psychiatric 
      disorders ranging from schizophrenia to reading disability. CONCLUSIONS: The
      field of psychiatric genetics has become one of the most vital and productive
      areas of psychiatric research. New findings are continually coming to light,
      bringing us ever closer to understanding these complex disorders at a molecular
      level. Such knowledge could lead to improved drug treatments, screening of
      at-risk individuals and even a reduction in the stigma attached to psychiatric
      disorders.

TI  - Number-word reading as challenging task in dyslexia? An ERP study.
PG  - 69-83
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate processes of lexical access,
      selection and early semantic access in young native Hungarian students as well as
      in dyslexics compensating successfully for their reading problems of
      developmental origin. The present study made use of the well-known lexical
      decision paradigm in which event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by words,
      number-words and pseudowords were measured. Subjects had to judge whether the
      letter strings seen were meaningful or meaningless. Our results suggest that in
      good readers additional activity occurs in the sensory or selection stage of
      lexical access when words of low sight frequency, e.g. number-words are read.
      Significant processing differences for words vs. number-words were found in the
      later stage of processing. Based on our ERP data we do not suggest number-words
      for judging general features of lexical processing, especially when developmental
      dyslexia is the focus of study. Our results show that young adults may develop a 
      particular compensation strategy for reading words of different frequency. We
      found that: (1) Lexical access is fast and accurate in good readers and the early
      components elicited by words and number-words do not differ. (2) Attentional
      effort is reflected by enhanced early components to number-words. (3) Dyslexics
      may compensate for the weakness of sight word vocabulary, characteristic for
      frequent words as well, during lexical selection and at a later stage of
      processing. (4) Dyslexic adults, who compensate well for reading difficulties,
      differ significantly in this later stage when words have to be read. (5) The late
      positive component of ERPs reflects additional activation allocated to word
      reading when low frequency words such as number-words are read. Good readers show
      this effect as well, therefore, the largest difference found between dyslexics
      and controls is found for frequent words. (6) The early semantic access is absent
      in dyslexics when pseudowords are read and this process may be one of the
      strategies used by dyslexics in a transparent orthography.

TI  - Why theories about developmental dyslexia require developmental designs.
PG  - 534-40
AB  - This article examines the importance of developmental designs in dyslexia
      research using a neuroconstructivist framework. According to neuroconstructivism,
      the lowest level of impairment should be identified as early as possible, and
      developmental effects on higher-level cognition examined longitudinally. A number
      of recent studies proposing candidate low-level impairments have not used such
      developmental designs. The role of normal variation in postulated causal factors 
      on development is ignored, inadequate control groups are used, and the nature and
      timing of environmental inputs are not measured, even though reading is taught
      systematically and both reading acquisition and dyslexia vary with orthography.
      It is suggested here that only a phonological deficit arising from low-level
      auditory processing problems meets the criteria for a neuroconstructivist
      approach.

TI  - Congenital amusia interferes with the ability to synchronize with music.
PG  - 166-9
AB  - Eight adults with a music-specific learning disability (i.e., tone deafness, but 
      we prefer the term "congenital amusia") were asked to tap along with music (e.g.,
      Ravel's Bolero) and with nonmusical isochronous sequences (i.e., noise bursts).
      The amusic persons' tapping performance was poorly synchronized with music
      compared to that of nine matched control participants. By contrast,
      synchronization with the noise bursts was normal, suggesting that amusic persons'
      timing difficulty is limited to music.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in familial temporal lobe epilepsy with 
      auditory auras.
PG  - 1546-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two forms of familial temporal lobe epilepsy (FTLE) have been
      described: mesial FTLE and FTLE with auditory auras. The gene responsible for
      mesial FTLE has not been mapped yet, whereas mutations in the LGI1 (leucine-rich,
      glioma-inactivated 1) gene, localized on chromosome 10q, have been found in FTLE 
      with auditory auras. OBJECTIVE: To describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      findings in patients with FTLE with auditory auras. DESIGN AND METHODS: We
      performed detailed clinical and molecular studies as well as MRI evaluation
      (including volumetry) in all available individuals from one family, segregating
      FTLE from auditory auras. RESULTS: We evaluated 18 of 23 possibly affected
      individuals, and 13 patients reported auditory auras. In one patient, auditory
      auras were associated with deja vu; in one patient, with ictal aphasia; and in 2 
      patients, with visual misperception. Most patients were not taking medication at 
      the time, although all of them reported sporadic auras. Two-point lod scores were
      positive for 7 genotyped markers on chromosome 10q, and a Zmax of 6.35 was
      achieved with marker D10S185 at a recombination fraction of 0.0. Nucleotide
      sequence analysis of the LGI1 gene showed a point mutation, VIIIS7(-2)A-G, in all
      affected individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 22 individuals 
      (7 asymptomatic, 4 of them carriers of the affected haplotype on chromosome 10q
      and the VIIIS7[-2]A-G mutation). Lateral temporal lobe malformations were
      identified by visual analysis in 10 individuals, 2 of them with global
      enlargement demonstrated by volumetry. Mildly reduced hippocampi were observed in
      4 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In this family with FTLE with auditory auras, we
      found developmental abnormalities in the lateral cortex of the temporal lobes in 
      53% of the affected individuals. In contrast with mesial FTLE, none of the
      affected individuals had MRI evidence of hippocampal sclerosis.

TI  - Neural substrates of impaired categorical perception of phonemes in adult
      dyslexics: an fMRI study.
PG  - 331-4
AB  - Phonological developmental dyslexics remain impaired in phonetic categorical
      perception (CP) even in adulthood. We studied the brain correlates of CP in
      dyslexics and controls using a block design fMRI protocol and stimuli from an
      phonetic continuum between natural /Pa/ and /Ta/ syllables. Subjects performed a 
      pseudo-passive listening task which does not imply voluntary categorical
      judgment. In the control group, categorical deviant stimuli elicited specific
      activations in the left angular gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus and the
      right superior cingulate cortex. These regions were not activated in the dyslexic
      group in which activation was observed for acoustic but not phonetic changes in
      stimuli. Failures to activate key regions for language perception and auditory
      attention in dyslexic might account for persistent deficits in phonological
      awareness and reading tasks.

TI  - Dyslexia: the articulatory hypothesis revisited.
PG  - 253-6
AB  - Articulatory disorders have been associated with developmental phonological
      dyslexia in the literature. However, very few information is available about the 
      articulatory movements involved in speech production in dyslexic children. This
      study uses aerodynamic/acoustic data to explore how dyslexic children produce
      bilabial stops in French (/b, p/) within a sentence where they occurred in two
      positions and in three vowel environments. Average durations of articulatory
      closure and release were calculated in 10 phonological dyslexic children and two 
      groups of age-matched and reading age-matched controls. Moreover, deviation from 
      a standard pronunciation of the same material was evaluated separately by blind
      examiners. Our results reveal differences in the timing of the articulatory
      movements between dyslexics and normal controls, as well as more deviations from 
      the target consonant for the dyslexics than for the controls. These observations 
      are consistent with recent findings pointing to a general deficit in fine motor
      control in dyslexia.

TI  - Developmental coordination disorder: a review of research on subtypes and
      comorbidities.
PG  - 479-93
AB  - The interest in Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) has grown considerably 
      over the last decade. Nevertheless, its etiology and prognosis are still poorly
      understood. The idea is growing that DCD may not be a uniform disorder. This
      review summarizes research on DCD, with a particular focus on subtype and
      comorbidity studies. The main message of the paper is that, in order to
      understand the etiology and prognosis of DCD, we need to have a better
      understanding of its nature. This requires an awareness of the existence of
      subtypes and comorbidities. Current theories on comorbidity phenomena are
      discussed in terms of their possible merit for the development of the field.
      Particular attention is given to the Automatization Deficit Hypothesis, a theory 
      based on research on dyslexia.

TI  - Annotation: Hyperlexia: disability or superability?
PG  - 1079-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of
      single-word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since
      the beginning of the last century. METHODS: An extensive search of publications
      on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were
      reviewed. RESULTS: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the
      following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic
      only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) 
      or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether
      hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders
      or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) 
      whether hyperlexia should be defined through single-word reading superiority with
      regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any
      combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a
      specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether
      hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6)
      whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability
      (talent). CONCLUSIONS: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that
      hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals
      with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single-word reading in
      the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a
      disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a
      discrepancy between levels of single-word reading and comprehension). We
      simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi-methodological
      approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research 
      framework of understanding single-word reading, are warranted and encouraged.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia in different languages: language-specific or universal?
PG  - 169-93
AB  - Most of the research on developmental dyslexia comes from English-speaking
      countries. However, there is accumulating evidence that learning to read English 
      is harder than learning to read other European orthographies (Seymour, Aro, &
      Erskine, 2003). These findings therefore suggest the need to determine whether
      the main English findings concerning dyslexia can be generalized to other
      European orthographies, all of which have less irregular spelling-to-sound
      correspondences than English. To do this, we conducted a study with German- and
      English-speaking children (n=149) in which we investigated a number of
      theoretically important marker effects of the reading process. The results
      clearly show that the similarities between dyslexic readers using different
      orthographies are far bigger than their differences. That is, dyslexics in both
      countries exhibit a reading speed deficit, a nonword reading deficit that is
      greater than their word reading deficit, and an extremely slow and serial
      phonological decoding mechanism. These problems were of similar size across
      orthographies and persisted even with respect to younger readers that were at the
      same reading level. Both groups showed that they could process larger
      orthographic units. However, the use of this information to supplement
      grapheme-phoneme decoding was not fully efficient for the English dyslexics.

TI  - Reading comprehension skills of young adults with childhood diagnoses of
      dyslexia.
PG  - 538-55
AB  - This study explores the contribution of cognitive processes to comprehension
      skills in adults who suffered from childhood developmental dyslexia (CD). The
      performance of adults with CD (ages 17 to 23), chronological age-matched (CA)
      adults, and reading level-matched (RL) children was compared on measures of
      phonological processing, naming speed, working memory (WM), general knowledge,
      vocabulary, and comprehension. The results showed that adults with CD scored
      lower on measures of phonological processing, naming speed, WM, general
      knowledge, and vocabulary when compared to CA readers but were comparable to RL
      children on the majority of process measures. Phonological processing, naming
      speed, vocabulary, general knowledge, and listening comprehension contributed
      independent variance to reading comprehension accuracy, whereas WM, intelligence,
      phonological processing, and listening comprehension contributed independent
      variance to comprehension fluency. Adults with CD scored lower than CA adults and
      higher than RL children on measures of lexical processing, WM, and listening
      comprehension when word recognition and intelligence were partialed from the
      analysis. In summary, constraints in phonological processing and naming speed
      mediate only some of the influence of high-order processes on reading
      comprehension. Furthermore, adults with CD experience difficulties in WM,
      listening comprehension, and vocabulary independently of their word recognition
      problems and intellectual ability.

TI  - Comorbid auditory processing disorder in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 448-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the extent of
      comorbid auditory processing disorder (APD) in a group of adults with
      developmental dyslexia. An additional objective was to compare performance on
      auditory tasks to results from standardized tests of reading in an attempt to
      generate a clinically useful profile of developmental dyslexics with comorbid
      APD. DESIGN: A group of eleven persons with developmental dyslexia and 14 age-
      and intelligence-matched controls participated in the study. Behavioral
      audiograms, 226-Hz tympanograms, and word recognition scores were obtained
      binaurally from all subjects. Both groups were administered the frequency-pattern
      test (FPT) and duration-pattern test (DPT) monaurally (30 items per ear) in both 
      the left and right ear. Gap detection results were obtained in both groups
      (binaural presentation) using narrowband noise centered at 1 kHz in an adaptive
      two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) paradigm. The FPT, DPT, and gap detection
      results were analyzed for interaural (where applicable), intergroup, and
      intragroup differences. Correlations between performance on the auditory tasks
      and the standardized tests of reading were examined. Additive logistic regression
      models were fit to the data to determine which auditory tests proved to be the
      best predictors of group membership. RESULTS: The persons with developmental
      dyslexia as a group performed significantly poorer than controls on both the FPT 
      and DPT. Furthermore, the group differences were significant in both monaural
      conditions. On the FPT and DPT, five of the eleven participants with dyslexia
      performed below the widely used clinical criterion for APD of 70% correct in
      either ear. All five of these participants performed below criterion on the FPT, 
      whereas four of the five additionally performed below 70% on the DPT. The data
      also were analyzed by fitting a series of stepwise logistic regression models,
      which indicated that gap detection did not significantly predict group
      membership, whereas the FPT and DPT were significant predictors. The addition of 
      the FPT score after the DPT did not result in a significant change in the
      residual deviance. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of the participants with
      developmental dyslexia showed clinically significant diminished performance on
      the FPT and DPT indicative of APD. These results indicate that the percentage of 
      persons with developmental dyslexia and comorbid APD may be substantial enough to
      warrant serious clinical considerations.

TI  - Orthography influences the perception of speech in alexic patients.
PG  - 981-90
AB  - Interactive models of reading propose that phonological representations directly 
      activate and/or constrain orthographic representations through feedback. These
      models also predict that spoken words should activate their orthographic forms.
      The effect of word orthography on auditory lexical access was investigated in two
      patients with alexia without agraphia. Several theories of alexia suggest that
      letter-by-letter reading results from impaired access to orthographic
      representations. Although alexics can often correctly identify orally spelled
      words and spell to dictation, it is unknown whether they can access the whole
      orthographic "word-form" as a unit via auditory presentation. The nonobligatory
      activation of orthography was examined in an auditory lexical decision task, in
      which the orthographic and phonological similarity between prime and target was
      manipulated. In controls, the combined effect of phonological and orthographic
      relatedness (OP) produced greater facilitation than phonological relatedness
      alone, indicating that orthography can influence auditory lexical decisions. The 
      alexics displayed patterns of facilitation comparable to controls, suggesting
      they can quickly access whole-word orthographic information via the auditory
      modality. An alternate account posits that the OP advantage does not require
      on-line access of orthography, but instead is a developmental by-product of
      learning to read an orthographically inconsistent language. The results have
      implications for cognitive theories of alexia and provide support for interactive
      models of word recognition.

TI  - A candidate gene for developmental dyslexia encodes a nuclear tetratricopeptide
      repeat domain protein dynamically regulated in brain.
PG  - 11553-8
AB  - Approximately 3-10% of people have specific difficulties in reading, despite
      adequate intelligence, education, and social environment. We report here the
      characterization of a gene, DYX1C1 near the DYX1 locus in chromosome 15q21, that 
      is disrupted by a translocation t(2;15)(q11;q21) segregating coincidentally with 
      dyslexia. Two sequence changes in DYX1C1, one involving the translation
      initiation sequence and an Elk-1 transcription factor binding site (-3G --> A)
      and a codon (1249G --> T), introducing a premature stop codon and truncating the 
      predicted protein by 4 aa, associate alone and in combination with dyslexia.
      DYX1C1 encodes a 420-aa protein with three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)
      domains, thought to be protein interaction modules, but otherwise with no
      homology to known proteins. The mouse Dyx1c1 protein is 78% identical to the
      human protein, and the nonhuman primates differ at 0.5-1.4% of residues. DYX1C1
      is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, and the protein resides in 
      the nucleus. In human brain, DYX1C1 protein localizes to a fraction of cortical
      neurons and white matter glial cells. We conclude that DYX1C1 should be regarded 
      as a candidate gene for developmental dyslexia. Detailed study of its function
      may open a path to understanding a complex process of development and maturation 
      of the human brain.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia and discrimination in speech perception: a dynamic model
      study.
PG  - 395-412
AB  - At the behavioral level one of the primary disturbances involved in congenital
      dyslexia concerns phonological processing. At the neuroarchitectural level
      autopsies have revealed ectopies, e.g., a reduced number of neurons in the upper 
      layers of the cortex and an increased number in the lower ones. In dynamic models
      of interacting neuronal populations the behavioral level can be related to the
      neurophysiological level. In this study an attempt is made to do so at the
      cortical level. The first focus of this model study are the results of a Finnish 
      experiment assessing geminate stop perception in quasi speech stimuli by 6 month 
      old infants using a head turning paradigm and evoked potentials. The second focus
      of this study are the results of a Dutch experiment assessing discrimination of
      transients in speech stimuli, by adult dyslexics and controls and 2 month old
      infants. There appears to be a difference in the phonemic perceptual boundaries
      of children at genetic risk for dyslexia and control children as revealed in the 
      Finnish study. Assuming a lowered neuronal density in the 'dyslexic' model,
      reflecting ectopies, it may be postulated that less neuronal surface is available
      for synaptic connections resulting in a lowered synaptic density and thus a
      lowered amount of available neurotransmitter. A lowered synaptic density also
      implies a reduced amount of membrane surface available for neurotransmitter
      metabolism. By assuming both, a reduced upper bound of neurotransmitter and a
      reduced metabolic transmitter rate in the dynamic model, the Finnish experimental
      results can be approximated closely. This applies both to data from behavioral
      head turning and that of the evoked potential study. In the Dutch study adult
      dyslexics show poor performance in discriminating transients in the speech signal
      compared to the controls. The same stimuli were used in a a study comparing
      infants from dyslexic families and controls. Using the same transmitter
      parameters as in modeling the results of the Finnish study, also in this case the
      experimental results for adults and infants can be approximated closely.
      Simulation of behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions with the model provide 
      predictions which can be put to the test in experiments.

TI  - Developmental genetic malformations of the cerebral cortex.
PG  - 433-41
AB  - Cortical malformations give rise to severe clinical manifestations such as
      epilepsy and mental retardation, but sometimes to more subtle problems like
      dyslexia. From a clinical standpoint, such structural abnormalities are diagnosed
      by radiographic and histologic findings, with disease classifications often based
      on these observations. Using this categorization, many of the responsible genes
      have been determined and now provide a means of understanding the molecular basis
      of the neurologic disorders. This review discusses the known genetic
      developmental syndromes in the context of the observed cortical malformations,
      the expression and function of the responsible genes, and their potential roles
      during the various stages of central nervous system development.

TI  - Recognition memory for high- and low-frequency words in adult normal and dyslexic
      readers: an event-related brain potential study.
PG  - 815-29
AB  - Differences in word processing between adult developmental dyslexic (n = 12) and 
      normal readers (n = 12) were studied using event-related brain potentials
      recorded while subjects performed a recognition memory task. During the first
      part of the experiment, words were presented consecutively, and within this phase
      one third of the words were repeated. Subjects had to indicate whether a given
      word had previously been seen or not. After a delay of 1 hr, a second phase was
      administered. Here, another list containing 33% old words (presented in Phase 1) 
      and 66% new words was shown and an old/new decision was required. In both
      categories, half of the words presented in either phase were of high normative
      frequency, and the other half were of low-frequency in the German language.
      Recognition performance was superior in normal readers for both high- and
      low-frequency words. In Phase 1, a fronto-centrally distributed N400 repetition
      effect discriminated between correctly identified old and new words (new words
      more negative). This effect was present for dyslexic as well as normal readers
      and for high- and low-frequency words. Between 450 and 800 ms, a 'P600 old/new
      effect' emerged (ERPs evoked by old words were more positive than those for new
      words). This effect was larger for low-frequency words. In Phase 2, an old/new
      effect was obtained for normal readers only. These findings are discussed in
      relation to current concepts of dyslexia and of semantic processing.

TI  - Predicting the continued use of overlays in school children--a comparison of the 
      Developmental Eye Movement test and the Rate of Reading test.
PG  - 457-64
AB  - Coloured overlays have been advocated to enhance reading speed and ability in
      children with reading difficulty or dyslexia. Assessing the efficacy of overlays 
      has to date been largely subjective. Objective assessment is presently carried
      out with the Rate of Reading test (RRT), where an increase in reading speed of
      more than 5% is considered to indicate a positive prognosis for continued use of 
      the overlay. The Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test is used to assess
      horizontal scanning behaviour in a number naming task. In this study both tests
      were utilised to determine whether coloured overlays could enhance reading
      performance or scanning. This article shows that for some children rate of
      reading is not improved with coloured overlays although performance on the DEM
      test does improve. Improvements to the DEM scores occurred in 88% of children who
      continued to use overlays for more than 3 months. This compared with 60%
      sensitivity in the RRT. The possible reasons for this phenomenon and the clinical
      implications are discussed.

TI  - Occupation choices of adults with and without symptoms of dyslexia.
PG  - 177-85
AB  - People with the learning disability developmental dyslexia characteristically
      have difficulties in processing written language. There is some evidence that
      they may also have talents in other areas such as visuospatial processing. This
      pattern of strengths and weaknesses may predispose people who have dyslexia
      towards adopting certain occupations and away from others. Although there is
      literature on career choice in learning disabled adults in general, relatively
      little work has been done specifically for dyslexia. We therefore compared the
      occupations of adults with and without symptoms of developmental dyslexia.
      Results were analysed using non-parametric statistics and are illustrated with a 
      case study. We found significant differences in the distribution of our samples. 
      Adults with symptoms of dyslexia were much less likely than adults not reporting 
      such symptoms to be involved in professions such as science/computing, management
      and finance. They were more likely to be involved in people-oriented professions 
      such as nursing or sales. While preliminary, these results suggest that people
      with dyslexia may indeed show significantly different patterns of occupation
      choice.

TI  - Developmental disorders of vision.
PG  - 687-707
AB  - This review of developmental disorders of vision focuses on only a few of the
      many disorders that disrupt visual development. Given the enormity of the human
      visual system in the primate brain and complexity of visual development, however,
      there are likely hundreds or thousands of types of disorders affecting high-level
      vision. The rapid progress seen in developmental dyslexia and WMS demonstrates
      the possibilities and difficulties inherent in researching such disorders, and
      the authors hope that similar progress will be made for congenital prosopagnosia 
      and other disorders in the near future.

TI  - Recognition memory for unfamiliar faces does not differ for adult normal and
      dyslexic readers: an event-related brain potential study.
PG  - 1285-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Differences in recognition memory for unfamiliar faces between adult
      developmental dyslexic (n=12) and normal readers (n=12) were studied by means of 
      event-related brain potentials. METHODS: Subjects performed a continuous face
      recognition task, in which 240 unfamiliar faces were presented on a computer
      screen, 100 of which were repetitions. For each face, subjects had to indicate
      whether it was presented before or not. Performance did not differ between normal
      and dyslexic readers. Old/repeated faces elicited more positive event-related
      potentials (ERPs) starting 250 ms poststimulus. These were analyzed in two
      time-windows encompassing the early (250-450 ms) and the late phase (450-750 ms) 
      of the old/new effect. RESULTS: No group difference in amplitude or topography of
      the old/new effect emerged. However, ERPs for all faces were more positive for
      normal compared with those of dyslexic readers. CONCLUSIONS: These results show
      that a previously described recognition memory deficit for words in dyslexic
      readers is likely to be specific for verbal material.

TI  - Analyzing the traumatic impact of childhood visual impairment.
PG  - 913-39
AB  - Material is presented from three analyses involving the impact on adult
      functioning of childhood trauma to the visual system. The clinical process by
      which unrecognized but ongoing traumatic reactions are identified for subsequent 
      analysis is described. It is of particular importance, with these patients, to
      recognize their lifelong experience of visual confusion resulting from problems
      in their visual anatomy. Only then can fantasies and affects related to these
      physically induced states of confusion be worked through. Working through these
      reactions promotes the neutralization of related primitive narcissistic affects, 
      mourning, and realistic accommodation, and leads to a more intact and integrated 
      sense of self, and a marked increase in self-esteem. With this newly integrated
      sense of self, the complex interaction between physically induced confusion
      states and more typical developmental conflicts with objects can be worked
      through, resulting in more realistic and intense cathexes of the external world. 
      The trauma suffered by these patients had been greatly compounded by its having
      gone unrecognized. To miss this yet again in an analysis is to repeat the past
      and retraumatize the patient. These findings have clear implications for patients
      with other biologically related symptoms (e.g., ADD, ADHD, and dyslexia).

PG  - 362-8
AB  - Lexical access and phonological decoding were tested in 100 normal adult readers 
      and 21 adult dyslexic individuals. Within the dyslexic sample, 11 dysphonetic
      dyslexic and 10 dyseidetic dyslexic participants were classified on the basis of 
      spelling patterns. In the 1st experiment, adult dyseidetic readers showed a
      marked deficit on the lexical-access decision task in comparison with adult
      dysphonetic readers. In the 2nd experiment, the phonological-decoding decision
      task did not separate the subtypes. A lexical-access deficit in adult dyseidetic 
      dyslexia cannot be explained in terms of a developmental delay. A
      phonological-decoding deficit in adult dyseidetic dyslexia may be explained by
      increased involvement of the lexical procedure in phonological assembly under an 
      analogy strategy.

TI  - Spectral and temporal degradation of speech as a simulation of morphosyntactic
      deficits in English and German.
PG  - 535-42
AB  - Spectral and temporal degradation of the speech stream is increasingly used to
      model receptive language deficits such as aphasia and developmental language
      disorders. As with results from patient studies, the specific pattern of
      receptive deficits can reveal underlying structural and processing
      characteristics of different languages. Here, we test English- and
      German-speaking college students' auditory comprehension of complex
      morphosyntactic structures under normal and 'dual-degradation' conditions. The
      resulting profiles of strength and vulnerability in the two languages highlight
      the cross-linguistic differences in reliability of syntactic and morphological
      cues, and closely resemble the deficits observed in previous studies of receptive
      aphasia.

TI  - Hypothalamic digoxin and hemispheric chemical dominance: relation to speech and
      language dysfunction.
PG  - 797-814
AB  - The isoprenoid pathway produces three key metabolites--endogenous digoxin,
      dolichol, and ubiquinone. Since endogenous digoxin can regulate neurotransmitter 
      transport and dolichols can modulate glycoconjugate synthesis important in
      synaptic connectivity, the pathway was assessed in patients with dyslexia,
      delayed recovery from global aphasia consequent to a dominant hemispheric
      thrombotic infarct, and developmental delay of speech milestone. The pathway was 
      also studied in right hemispheric, left hemispheric, and bihemispheric dominance 
      to find out the role of hemispheric dominance in the pathogenesis of speech
      disorders. The plasma/serum--activity of HMG CoA reductase, magnesium, digoxin,
      dolichol, ubiquinone--and tryptophan/tyrosine catabolic patterns, as well as RBC 
      (Na+)-K+ ATPase activity, were measured in the above mentioned groups. The
      glycoconjugate metabolism and membrane composition was also studied. The study
      showed that in dyslexia, developmental delay of speech milestone, and delayed
      recovery from global aphasia there was an upregulated isoprenoidal pathway with
      increased digoxin and dolichol levels. The membrane (Na+)-K+ ATPase activity,
      serum magnesium and ubiquinone levels were low. The tryptophan catabolites were
      increased and the tyrosine catabolites including dopamine decreased in the serum 
      contributing to a speech dysfunction. There was an increase in carbohydrate
      residues of glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans, and glycolipids levels as well as 
      an increased activity of GAG degrading enzymes and glyco hydrolases in the serum.
      The cholesterol:phospholipid ratio of RBC membrane increased and membrane
      glycoconjugates showed a decrease. All of these could contribute to altered
      synaptic inactivity in these disorders. The patterns correlated with those
      obtained in right hemispheric chemical dominance. Right hemispheric chemical
      dominance may play a role in the genesis of these disorders. Hemispheric chemical

TI  - Balance and gait in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 237-44
AB  - Tests of postural stability have provided some evidence of a link between
      deficits in gross motor skills and developmental dyslexia. The ordinal-level
      scales used previously, however, have limited measurement sensitivity, and no
      studies have investigated motor performance during walking in participants with
      dyslexia. The purpose of this study was to investigate if continuous-scaled
      measures of standing balance and gait could discriminate between groups of
      impaired and normal readers when investigators were blind to group membership
      during testing. Children with dyslexia ( n=22) and controls ( n=18), aged 10-12
      years, performed walking tests at four different speeds (slow-preferred-fast-very
      fast) on an even and an uneven surface, and tests of unperturbed and perturbed
      body sway during standing. Body movements were registered by a triaxial
      accelerometer over the lower trunk, and measures of reaction time, body sway,
      walking speed, step length and cadence were calculated. Results were controlled
      for gender differences. Tests of standing balance with eyes closed did not
      discriminate between groups. All unperturbed standing tests with eyes open showed
      significant group differences ( P<0.05) and classified correctly 70-77.5% of the 
      subjects into their respective groups. Mean walking speed during very fast
      walking on both flat and uneven surface was > or =0.2 m/s ( P< or =0.01) faster
      for controls than for the group with dyslexia. This test classified 77.5% and 85%
      of the subjects correctly on flat and uneven surface, respectively. Cadence at
      preferred or very fast speed did not differ statistically between groups, but
      revealed significant group differences when all subjects were compared at a
      normalised walking speed ( P< or =0.04). Very fast walking speed as well as
      cadence at a normalised speed discriminated better between groups when subjects
      were walking on an uneven surface compared to a flat floor. Continuous-scaled
      walking tests performed in field settings may be suitable for motor skill
      assessment as a component of a screening tool for developmental dyslexia.

TI  - A genome scan for developmental dyslexia confirms linkage to chromosome 2p11 and 
      suggests a new locus on 7q32.
PG  - 340-5
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a distinct learning disability with unexpected
      difficulty in learning to read despite adequate intelligence, education, and
      environment, and normal senses. The genetic aetiology of dyslexia is
      heterogeneous and loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 15, and 18 have been repeatedly
      linked to it. We have conducted a genome scan with 376 markers in 11 families
      with 38 dyslexic subjects ascertained in Finland. Linkage of dyslexia to the
      vicinity of DYX3 on 2p was confirmed with a non-parametric linkage (NPL) score of
      2.55 and a lod score of 3.01 for a dominant model, and a novel locus on 7q32
      close to the SPCH1 locus was suggested with an NPL score of 2.77. The SPCH1 locus
      has previously been linked with a severe speech and language disorder and autism,
      and a mutation in exon 14 of the FOXP2 gene on 7q32 has been identified in one
      large pedigree. Because the language disorder associated with the SPCH1 locus has
      some overlap with the language deficits observed in dyslexia, we sequenced the
      coding region of FOXP2 as a candidate gene for our observed linkage in six
      dyslexic subjects. No mutations were identified. We conclude that DYX3 appears to
      be important for dyslexia susceptibility in many Finnish families, and a
      suggested linkage of dyslexia to chromosome 7q32 will need verification in other 
      data sets.

TI  - Can the magnocellular pathway read? Evidence from studies of color.
PG  - 1211-22
AB  - A review of the neurophysiological literature suggests that the magnocellular
      pathway has adequate spatial-frequency and contrast sensitivity to perceive text 
      under normal contrast conditions (>10%) and also is suppressed by red light.
      Results from three experiments involving color and reading show that red light
      impairs reading performance under normal luminance contrast conditions. However
      in a fourth experiment, isoluminant color text, designed to selectively activate 
      the parvocellular pathway, is easier to read under red light. These discrepant
      results suggest that the magnocellular pathway is the dominant visual pathway for
      text perception. Implications for reading models and developmental dyslexia are
      discussed.

TI  - Continuing the search for dyslexia genes on 6p.
PG  - 89-98
AB  - This study is a continuation and extension of the work with Orton Developmental
      Dyslexia (DD) pedigrees [Grigorenko et al., 1997; 2000, Grigorenko et al., 2001].
      This study utilized an extended sample (N = 176) and a well-saturated map of
      chromosome 6p (30 markers). Six phenotypes were constructed to span a range of
      dyslexia-related cognitive processes. These phenotypes were: (1) Phonemic
      Awareness (of spoken words); (2) Phonological Decoding (of printed nonwords); (3)
      Rapid Automatized Naming (of colored squares or object drawings); (4) Single Word
      Reading (orally, of printed real words); (5) Phonemic
      Awareness/Decoding/Single-Word Reading pathway; and (6) Phonemic Awareness/Rapid 
      Naming/Single-Word Reading pathway. The study resulted in two major findings.
      First, considering the distributions of the genetic linkage indicators across all
      phenotypes examined, there appear to be three regions of interest (around markers
      D6S109, D6S1261, and in the D6S105-D6S265 region). Any of these regions could
      serve as a starting point in the search for specific gene candidates contributing
      to the manifestation of DD, yet they all might be echo peaks of a single peak,
      the boundary of which is difficult to establish due to the limited power of this 
      sample. Second, the DD-related linkage in 6p21.3 appears to be most closely
      related to the manifestations of DD through phonemic awareness and single-word
      reading deficits.

TI  - Theories of developmental dyslexia: insights from a multiple case study of
      dyslexic adults.
PG  - 841-65
AB  - A multiple case study was conducted in order to assess three leading theories of 
      developmental dyslexia: (i) the phonological theory, (ii) the magnocellular
      (auditory and visual) theory and (iii) the cerebellar theory. Sixteen dyslexic
      and 16 control university students were administered a full battery of
      psychometric, phonological, auditory, visual and cerebellar tests. Individual
      data reveal that all 16 dyslexics suffer from a phonological deficit, 10 from an 
      auditory deficit, four from a motor deficit and two from a visual magnocellular
      deficit. Results suggest that a phonological deficit can appear in the absence of
      any other sensory or motor disorder, and is sufficient to cause a literacy
      impairment, as demonstrated by five of the dyslexics. Auditory disorders, when
      present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment.
      However, auditory deficits cannot be characterized simply as rapid auditory
      processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are
      they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little
      support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar
      origin or reflect an automaticity deficit. Overall, the present data support the 
      phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional
      sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals.

TI  - Auditory and visual automatic attention deficits in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 185-91
AB  - Several studies have provided evidence for a phonological deficit in
      developmental dyslexia. However, recent studies provide evidence for a multimodal
      temporal processing deficit in dyslexia. In fact, dyslexics show both auditory
      and visual abnormalities, which could result from a more general problem in the
      perceptual selection of stimuli. Here we report the results of a behavioral study
      showing that children with dyslexia have both auditory and visual deficits in the
      automatic orienting of spatial attention. These findings suggest that a deficit
      of selective spatial attention may distort the development of phonological and
      orthographic representations that is essential for learning to read.

PG  - 212-8
AB  - Dyslexia research now faces an intriguing paradox. It is becoming increasingly
      clear that a significant proportion of dyslexics present sensory and/or motor
      deficits; however, as this 'sensorimotor syndrome' is studied in greater detail, 
      it is also becoming increasingly clear that sensory and motor deficits will
      ultimately play only a limited role in a causal explanation of specific reading
      disability.

TI  - Reading problems and depressed mood.
PG  - 219-29
AB  - Although reading difficulties show well-established overlaps with disruptive
      behavior disorders in childhood, much less is known about reading-disabled
      children's vulnerability to emotional difficulties. Using longitudinal data from 
      6 assessments of boys in the Pittsburgh Youth Study, we found robust links
      between severe, persistent reading problems and increased risk for depressed mood
      in a community sample of boys aged 7 and 10 years at initial assessment, though
      not in those who had already entered their teens. These associations could not be
      accounted for in terms of selected family risks or comorbid disruptive behaviors;
      instead, the pattern of the findings pointed to the existence of more direct
      causal processes whereby reading problems influence younger boys' risk of

TI  - Neural deficits in children with dyslexia ameliorated by behavioral remediation: 
      evidence from functional MRI.
PG  - 2860-5
AB  - Developmental dyslexia, characterized by unexplained difficulty in reading, is
      associated with behavioral deficits in phonological processing. Functional
      neuroimaging studies have shown a deficit in the neural mechanisms underlying
      phonological processing in children and adults with dyslexia. The present study
      examined whether behavioral remediation ameliorates these dysfunctional neural
      mechanisms in children with dyslexia. Functional MRI was performed on 20 children
      with dyslexia (8-12 years old) during phonological processing before and after a 
      remediation program focused on auditory processing and oral language training.
      Behaviorally, training improved oral language and reading performance.
      Physiologically, children with dyslexia showed increased activity in multiple
      brain areas. Increases occurred in left temporo-parietal cortex and left inferior
      frontal gyrus, bringing brain activation in these regions closer to that seen in 
      normal-reading children. Increased activity was observed also in right-hemisphere
      frontal and temporal regions and in the anterior cingulate gyrus. Children with
      dyslexia showed a correlation between the magnitude of increased activation in
      left temporo-parietal cortex and improvement in oral language ability. These
      results suggest that a partial remediation of language-processing deficits,
      resulting in improved reading, ameliorates disrupted function in brain regions
      associated with phonological processing and produces additional compensatory
      activation in other brain regions.

      dyslexia.
PG  - 501-4
AB  - The current study aimed at determining whether the deviance of hemispheric
      asymmetry in the auditory cortex of children with dyslexia is also evident in
      dyslexic adults. Ten adult dyslexic subjects and 10 normally literate controls
      were presented with the syllable [ba:] while event-related brain activity was
      recorded from both hemispheres using whole-head magnetoencephalography. In
      control subjects, the auditory N100m source was found to be asymmetrical with a
      more anterior localization in the right than in the left perisylvian cortex
      (difference = 0.78 cm). The N100 m dipoles in dyslexic adults did not exhibit the
      same interhemispheric asymmetry (difference = -0.06 cm). The results indicate
      that reduced hemispheric laterality of perisylvian regions in dyslexia persists
      into adulthood.

TI  - Use of multivariate linkage analysis for dissection of a complex cognitive trait.
PG  - 561-70
AB  - Replication of linkage results for complex traits has been exceedingly difficult,
      owing in part to the inability to measure the precise underlying phenotype, small
      sample sizes, genetic heterogeneity, and statistical methods employed in
      analysis. Often, in any particular study, multiple correlated traits have been
      collected, yet these have been analyzed independently or, at most, in bivariate
      analyses. Theoretical arguments suggest that full multivariate analysis of all
      available traits should offer more power to detect linkage; however, this has not
      yet been evaluated on a genomewide scale. Here, we conduct multivariate
      genomewide analyses of quantitative-trait loci that influence reading- and
      language-related measures in families affected with developmental dyslexia. The
      results of these analyses are substantially clearer than those of previous
      univariate analyses of the same data set, helping to resolve a number of key
      issues. These outcomes highlight the relevance of multivariate analysis for
      complex disorders for dissection of linkage results in correlated traits. The
      approach employed here may aid positional cloning of susceptibility genes in a
      wide spectrum of complex traits.

TI  - Family risk of dyslexia is continuous: individual differences in the precursors
      of reading skill.
PG  - 358-73
AB  - The development of 56 children at family risk of dyslexia was followed from the
      age of 3 years, 9 months to 8 years. In the high-risk group, 66% had reading
      disabilities at age 8 years compared with 13% in a control group from similar,
      middle-class backgrounds. However, the family risk of dyslexia was continuous,
      and high-risk children who did not fulfil criteria for reading impairment at 8
      years performed as poorly at age 6 as did high-risk impaired children on tests of
      grapheme-phoneme knowledge. The findings are interpreted within an interactive
      model of reading development in which problems in establishing a phonological
      pathway in dyslexic families may be compensated early by children who have strong
      language skills.

TI  - Do the reading disabilities of children with cleft fit into current models of
      developmental dyslexia?
PG  - 154-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reading
      problems of children with cleft fit models of developmental dyslexia. DESIGN: The
      study compared children with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate who had reading
      disability (n = 46) with those who did not have reading disability (n = 46). The 
      children were matched for age, sex, and grade. The two groups were compared (t
      tests) on measures of verbal expression, phonemic awareness, and rapid naming.
      Also, regression analyses compared the relative relationships of these variables 
      to reading disability. PARTICIPANTS: Children were selected from 154 patients
      originally screened. RESULTS: Children with reading disability scored
      significantly lower on rapid naming and verbal expression, with no differences
      found on phonemic awareness. Rapid naming was shown to have the most significant 
      association with reading disability. CONCLUSION: Children with nonsyndromic cleft
      lip and palate show symptoms similar to a naming-memory deficit model of
      developmental dyslexia. Reading treatment should avoid sight word approaches and 
      focus on oral phonics treatment.

AB  - Case records of HIV infected patients were analyzed for identifying neurological 
      manifestations. Eight patients (7 males) were identified to have probable HIV
      encephalopathy (in a period of 24 months) as per the CDC revised classification
      system. Their ages ranged from one year to ten years. The neurological
      manifestations noted included-developmental delay (2 cases), seizures (6 cases), 
      acute onset alteration of sensorium (4 cases), aphasia (2 cases), loss of vision 
      (2 cases), focal neurological deficits (6 cases), brisk deep tendon reflexes (7
      cases), extensor plantar responses (5 cases) and signs of cerebellar dysfunction 
      (2 cases). Other clinical features included growth failure, microcephaly, fever, 
      lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pneumonia, otorrhea and oral
      candidiasis. Cerebrospinal fluid studies were normal. The neuroimaging features
      included cerebral atrophy and ventricular dilatation, cerebral infarction, basal 
      ganglia calcification and cerebellar atrophy. Childhood HIV infection may have a 
      variety of neurological abnormalities. HIV infection should be suspected in
      children presenting with unexplained neurological manifestations and growth
      failure.

TI  - The relationship between auditory temporal processing, phonemic awareness, and
      reading disability.
PG  - 218-43
AB  - Recent research suggests an auditory temporal deficit as a possible contributing 
      factor to poor phonemic awareness skills. This study investigated the
      relationship between auditory temporal processing of nonspeech sounds and
      phonological awareness ability in children with a reading disability, aged 8-12
      years, using Tallal's tone-order judgement task. Normal performance on the
      tone-order task was established for 36 normal readers. Forty-two children with
      developmental reading disability were then subdivided by their performance on the
      tone-order task. Average and poor tone-order subgroups were then compared on
      their ability to process speech sounds and visual symbols, and on phonological
      awareness and reading. The presence of a tone-order deficit did not relate to
      performance on the order processing of speech sounds, to poorer phonological
      awareness or to more severe reading difficulties. In particular, there was no
      evidence of a group by interstimulus interval interaction, as previously
      described in the literature, and thus little support for a general auditory
      temporal processing difficulty as an underlying problem in poor readers. In this 
      study, deficient order judgement on a nonverbal auditory temporal order task
      (tone task) did not underlie phonological awareness or reading difficulties.

TI  - Therapeutics in pediatric epilepsy, Part 2: Epilepsy surgery and vagus nerve
      stimulation.
PG  - 371-8
AB  - When antiepileptic drugs fail to relieve seizures adequately in children and
      adolescents, more invasive therapies such as epilepsy surgery and an implanted
      device to stimulate the vagus nerve should be considered. Temporal lobectomy is
      an effective treatment of complex partial and secondarily generalized
      tonic-clonic seizures arising in the mesial structures or lateral temporal
      neocortex. Excellent outcomes (seizure free or rare, nondisabling seizures) are
      achieved in at least 70% of children. The most common adverse effect is a
      superior quadrant field cut that is usually asymptomatic. Transient and more
      long-lasting language difficulties have been reported when the surgery involves
      the dominant temporal lobe. The excellent outcome rate for extratemporal surgery 
      ranges from approximately 20% to 80%, with better results seen in patients with
      an identifiable lesion. Potential morbidity is related to the region of resected 
      neocortex. Corpus callosotomy is an excellent procedure for palliation but is not
      a cure for seizures that cause falls, with substantial improvement seen in more
      than 80% of patients. Potential adverse effects include more intense focal
      seizures and dysphasia, depending on the developmental level of the individual.
      Hemispherectomy provides seizure relief in 60% to 80% of patients with
      hemispherical pathologies such as Sturge-Weber or Rasmussen syndromes. Operative 
      mortality has been reported in the range of 0% to 6%; other morbidities include
      infection and hydrocephalus. Stimulation of the vagus nerve has reduced partial
      seizures by 50% or more in approximately one third of patients. No adverse
      cognitive or systemic effects are associated with use of the implanted vagus
      nerve stimulator.

TI  - Age-related improvements in auditory temporal resolution in reading-impaired
      children.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - Individuals with developmental dyslexia show impairments in processing that
      require precise timing of sensory events. Here, we show that in a test of
      auditory temporal acuity (a gap-detection task) children ages 6-9 years with
      dyslexia exhibited a significant deficit relative to age-matched controls. In
      contrast, this deficit was not observed in groups of older reading-impaired
      individuals (ages 10-11 years; 12-13 years) or in adults (ages 23-25 years). It
      appears, therefore, that early temporal resolution deficits in those with reading
      impairments may significantly ameliorate over time. However, the occurrence of an
      early deficit in temporal acuity may be antecedent to other language-related
      perceptual problems (particularly those related to phonological processing) that 
      persist after the primary deficit has resolved. This result suggests that if
      remedial interventions targeted at temporal resolution deficits are to be
      effective, the early detection of the deficit and early application of the
      remedial programme is especially critical.

TI  - The perception of "sine-wave speech" by adults with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 68-79
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that, as a group, children or adults with
      developmental dyslexia perceive isolated syllables or words abnormally.
      Continuous speech containing reduced acoustic information also might prove
      perceptually difficult to such listeners. They might, however, exploit the intact
      syntactic and semantic features present in whole utterances, thereby compensating
      fully for impaired speech perception. "Sine-wave speech" sentences afford a test 
      of these competing possibilities. The sentences contain only 4
      frequency-modulated sine waves, lacking many acoustic cues present in natural
      speech. Adults with and without dyslexia were asked to orally reproduce 9
      sine-wave utterances, each occurring in 4 immediately successive trials.
      Participants with dyslexia reported fewer words than did control listeners.
      Practice, phonological contrasts, and word position affected both groups
      similarly. Comprehension of sine-wave sentences seems impaired in many, but not
      all, adults with dyslexia. A reduced auditory memory capacity may contribute to
      this deficit.

PG  - S3-9
AB  - Developmental dyslexia makes up an important proportion of the known learning
      disorders. Until the late 1970s most research on dyslexia was carried out by
      educators and educational psychologists, but soon after the publication of some
      dyslexic cases with focal disorders of neuronal migration to the cerebral cortex,
      interest in the neurobiological and neurocognitive underpinnings of dyslexia
      grew, especially in Europe and North America. There are at least two types of
      developmental dyslexia--phonological and surface. Surface dyslexia refers to a
      disorder in which the difficulty lies in reading irregular words, whereas
      phonological dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with pseudowords.
      Phonological dyslexia is the more common of the two types. Surface dyslexia does 
      not present a major problem in a language such as Spanish, where the number of
      irregular words is indeed very small. Still, in languages such as English, where 
      irregular words are common, the phonological type of developmental dyslexia is
      much more common. Phonologic dyslexics have problems with phonological awareness,
      that is, the conscious knowledge and manipulation of speech sounds, which is the 
      most proximate explanation for their difficulty in reading pseudowords. Many, but
      not all, phonologic dyslexics also have problems processing rapidly changing
      sounds, even if not linguistic, and some slow sounds, too. The same group tends
      to have visual problems, especially involving the so-called magnocellular pathway
      of the visual system, which, among others, has the role of analyzing movement.
      Accompanying these perceptual and cognitive deficits, phonologic dyslexics also
      show abnormal brain activation to phonological tasks, as shown in functional
      magnetic resonance studies (figure). In addition, dyslexic brains show focal
      malformations, ectopias and microgyria, of the cerebral cortex, involving mainly 
      the left perisylvian region and the word form area in the temporo-occipital
      junction. There are also changes in the composition of neurons in the lateral and
      medial geniculate nuclei of the thalamus. Experimental studies indicate that the 
      thalamic changes are a consequence of the focal malformations, and that they are 
      responsible for the sound processing deficits. None of these discoveries have
      changed the therapeutic modalities in this condition, but it is hoped that this
      will be the next area of progress.

TI  - Contrast sensitivity in subgroups of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 467-77
AB  - It has been proposed that developmental dyslexia is associated with a deficit in 
      the magnocellular pathway of the visual system. Other research focuses upon the
      heterogeneous nature of developmental dyslexia, and evidence that subgroups of
      dyslexia may be identified based on selective deficits in specific component
      reading skills. This study tested the hypothesis that visual processing deficits 
      may be present in different subgroups of developmental dyslexia by comparing the 
      visual contrast sensitivity of three subgroups of dyslexic children
      (phonological, surface and mixed) and controls. The stimulus designed to measure 
      magnocellular visual function was a low spatial frequency Gaussian blob,
      flickered sinusoidally at a temporal frequency of 8.33 Hz. The control stimulus, 
      designed to measure parvocellular visual function, was a relatively high spatial 
      frequency Gaussian windowed grating (8 c/deg) slowly ramped on and off. There
      were no significant differences between the groups of dyslexic and control
      children in contrast sensitivity to either stimulus. The findings do not support 
      the existence of a magnocellular system deficit in dyslexia.

TI  - Crossmodal temporal processing acuity impairment aggravates with age in
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 151-4
AB  - Temporal processing has been found to be impaired in developmental dyslexia. We
      investigated how aging affects crossmodal temporal processing impairment with 39 
      dyslexic and 40 fluent 20-59-year-old readers. Cognitive temporal acuity was
      measured at millisecond levels in six tasks. They consisted of order judgments of
      two brief non-speech stimulus pulses, the stimuli being audiotactile,
      visuotactile and audiovisual, and of simultaneity/nonsimultaneity detection of
      the pulses in two parallel three-pulse trains. Temporal acuity declined with age 
      in both reading groups and its impairment was observed in developmental dyslexia.
      A new finding was that the crossmodal temporal impairment, directly relevant to
      reading, increased with age. The age-related exacerbation suggests a
      developmental neuronal deficit, possibly related to magnocells, which exists
      before dyslexia and is its ontogenetic cause.

      classification tasks.
PG  - 22-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded to investigate
      allocation of attention in adult developmental dyslexics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS:
      Twelve adult developmental dyslexics and 12 matched normal controls performed
      three visual choice reaction tasks. In the passive oddball condition, subjects
      watched two different simple visual stimuli presented with 87.5 and 12.5%
      probability. In the active oddball condition, participants responded to the
      low-probability target stimulus. In the active 50/50-condition, both stimuli were
      presented with 50% probability and a response was required to the target stimulus
      only. RESULTS: No group differences emerged for performance, P300 latency or
      laterality and for N200 amplitude, latency or laterality. An enhancement of P300 
      amplitude with a frontal distribution was found for NoGo (standard)-stimuli in
      both active conditions for the dyslexic sample. CONCLUSION: Results are discussed
      in the context of deviances in allocation of attentional resources in dyslexic
      readers.

TI  - Psychopathology in the postgenomic era.
PG  - 205-28
AB  - We are rapidly approaching the postgenomic era in which we will know all of the 3
      billion DNA bases in the human genome sequence and all of the variations in the
      genome sequence that are ultimately responsible for genetic influence on
      behavior. These ongoing advances and new techniques will make it easier to
      identify genes associated with psychopathology. Progress in identifying such
      genes has been slower than some experts expected, probably because many genes are
      involved for each phenotype, which means the effect of any one gene is small.
      Nonetheless, replicated linkages and associations are being found, for example,
      for dementia, reading disability, and hyperactivity. The future of genetic
      research lies in finding out how genes work (functional genomics). It is
      important for the future of psychology that pathways between genes and behavior
      be examined at the top-down psychological level of analysis (behavioral
      genomics), as well as at the bottom-up molecular biological level of cells or the
      neuroscience level of the brain. DNA will revolutionize psychological research
      and treatment during the coming decades.

TI  - The role of visuospatial attention in developmental dyslexia: evidence from a
      rehabilitation study.
PG  - 154-64
AB  - Shifting of visual attention induced by peripheral cues was studied in 24
      children with specific reading disorder (SRD) or dyslexia and was compared with
      that of 19 normal readers by means of a covert orienting paradigm. This paradigm 
      presents participants with valid, neutral and invalid spatial cues preceding the 
      presentation of a target stimulus. As compared to normal readers, in SRD children
      the inhibition effect (i.e. the difference between neutral and invalid cues) was 
      absent. The 24 SRD children were divided into two groups matched for age, IQ and 
      reading ability to study the efficacy of two different rehabilitation procedures.
      We assessed the effects on reading accuracy and speed over a 4-month treatment
      with visual hemisphere specific stimulation (VHSS; J. Learn Disabil. 25 (1992)
      102) vs. traditional speech training. The VHSS program trains participants to
      perform rapid endogenous attentional orienting by presenting briefly flashed
      words in the peripheral visual field. We found that children treated with VHSS
      showed significant changes in their attentional inhibition process, as indicated 
      by increased costs for 'reorienting' the attentional focus. As this treatment
      program also proved to be highly efficient in improving the children's reading
      abilities, the possible causal relationship between reading and inhibition
      mechanisms of visuospatial attention was discussed.

TI  - Speech and language therapy interventions for children with primary speech and
      language delay or disorder.
PG  - CD004110
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is thought that approximately 6% of children have speech and
      language difficulties of which the majority will not have any other significant
      developmental difficulties. Whilst most children's difficulties resolve, children
      whose difficulties persist into primary school may have long-term problems
      concerning literacy, socialisation, behaviour and school attainment. OBJECTIVES: 
      To examine the effectiveness of speech and language interventions for children
      with primary speech and language delay/disorder. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following
      databases were searched: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane
      Library, CENTRAL: 2002/3), CINAHL (1982 - July 2002), EMBASE (1980 - Sept Week 4 
      2002), ERIC (1965 - 2002), MEDLINE (1966 - Sept Week 3 2002), PsycINFO (1872 -
      2002/10 Week 2), The National Research Register (2002/3). In addition to this
      references were taken from reviews of the literature and reference lists from
      articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review considered randomised controlled trials 
      of speech and language therapy interventions for children or adolescents with
      primary speech and language delay/disorder. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles 
      and abstracts were identified and assessed for relevance, before the full text
      version was obtained of all potentially relevant articles. The data were
      categorised depending on the nature of the control group and considered in terms 
      of the effects of intervention on expressive and receptive phonology, syntax and 
      vocabulary. The outcomes used in the analysis were dependent on the focus of the 
      study with only the primary effects of therapy being considered in this review.
      MAIN RESULTS: The results of twenty-five studies were used in the meta-analysis. 
      The results suggest that speech and language therapy is effective for children
      with phonological (SMD=0.44, 95%CI: 0.01,0.86) or vocabulary difficulties
      (SMD=0.89, 95%CI: 0.21,1.56), but that there is less evidence that interventions 
      are effective for children with receptive difficulties (SMD=-0.04, 95%CI:
      -0.64,0.56). Mixed findings were found concerning the effectiveness of expressive
      syntax interventions (n=233; SMD=1.02, 95%CI: 0.04-2.01). No significant
      differences were shown between clinician administered intervention and
      intervention implemented by trained parents, and studies did not show a
      difference between the effects of group and individual interventions (SMD=0.01,
      95%CI: -0.26,1.17). The use of normal language peers in therapy was shown to have
      a positive effect on therapy outcome (SMD=2.29, 95%CI: 1.11,3.48). REVIEWER'S
      CONCLUSIONS: The review shows that overall there is a positive effect of speech
      and language therapy interventions for children with expressive phonological and 
      expressive vocabulary difficulties. The evidence for expressive syntax
      difficulties is more mixed, and there is a need for further research to
      investigate intervention for receptive language difficulties. There is a large
      degree of heterogeneity in the results, and the sources of this need to be
      investigated.

TI  - Clinical importance of parent ratings of everyday cognitive abilities in children
      with learning and attention problems.
PG  - 87-95
AB  - This study addressed two issues: first, whether parental reports contribute
      information over and above a standardized psychometric assessment, and second,
      whether parental reports of everyday cognitive functioning might be useful in
      distinguishing between children with reading disabilities (RD),
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and combined ADHD + RD.
      Parent-reported information on 159 children with learning or attention problems
      was obtained using a questionnaire called the Parent Ratings of Everyday
      Cognitive and Academic Abilities (PRECAA). Psychometric information used for
      comparison included the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-Revised, the
      Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-Short Form, the Vocabulary and
      Block Design subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd
      edition, and the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration. The PRECAA was
      found to be sensitive to group differences between children with RD and children 
      with ADHD and combined ADHD + RD. Its inclusion resulted in a significant
      increase in the number of children correctly classified compared to the use of
      psychometric measures alone. The PRECAA correctly classified more children (66%) 
      than did the standard psychometric measures (50%). In fact, a very high
      percentage of children with ADHD (81%) were correctly classified using the
      PRECAA. These findings suggest that the PRECAA may be a useful aid to clinicians 
      in the identification of children with learning and attention problems.

      association to their toddlers' language development.
PG  - 74-86
AB  - The play and language behavior of mothers with (n = 49) and without (n = 49)
      specific reading disabilities (RD) was investigated during play with their
      14-month-old children. The contribution of maternal behavior to the language
      development of their children was examined. The children's receptive and
      expressive language skills were assessed longitudinally at 14, 18, and 30 months,
      using the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories and the Reynell
      Developmental Language Scales. Children with and without familial risk for RD did
      not differ from each other in any play or language measures at these ages. No
      group differences were found for mothers' manifestations of nonsymbolic play and 
      language. However, the typically reading (TR) mothers produced significantly more
      symbolic play and language in play interactions with their child than did the
      mothers with RD. The correspondence between mother-child symbolic play and
      maternal play-related language was also higher for the TR group than it was for
      the RD group. The mothers' symbolic play did not show any relation to their
      children's language development, but their expressions of symbolic language did
      show a relationship. The mothers' child-directed symbolic language contributed
      significantly toward the comprehension skills of 14- and 18-month-olds in the RD 
      group. This association, however, was lower at 30 months, at which point it was
      reliably present for the first time in the TR group.

TI  - Do the effects of computer-assisted practice differ for children with reading
      disabilities with and without IQ-achievement discrepancy?
PG  - 34-47
AB  - This study was designed to assess whether the effects of computer-assisted
      practice on visual word recognition differed for children with reading
      disabilities (RD) with or without aptitude-achievement discrepancy. A sample of
      73 Spanish children with low reading performance was selected using the
      discrepancy method, based on a standard score comparison (i.e., the difference
      between IQ and achievement standard scores). The sample was classified into three
      groups: (1) a group of 14 children with dyslexia (age M = 103.85 months; SD =
      8.45) who received computer-based reading practice; (2) a group of 31
      "garden-variety" (GV) poor readers (age M = 107.06 months; SD = 6.75) who
      received the same type of instruction; and (3) a group of 28 children with low
      reading performance (age M = 103.33 months; SD = 9.04) who did not receive
      computer-assisted practice. Children were pre- and posttested in word
      recognition, reading comprehension, phonological awareness, and visual and
      phonological tasks. The results indicated that both computer-assisted
      intervention groups showed improved word recognition compared to the control
      group. Nevertheless, children with dyslexia had more difficulties than GV poor
      readers during computer-based word reading under conditions that required
      extensive phonological computation, because their performance was more affected
      by low-frequency words and long words. In conclusion, we did not find empirical
      evidence in favor of the IQ-achievement discrepancy definition of reading
      disability, because IQ did not differentially predict treatment outcomes.

TI  - The relationship between IQ and reading disabilities in English-speaking Canadian
      and Spanish children.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - This study was designed to examine the role of intelligence (IQ) in the
      definition of reading disabilities (RD) in languages with different orthographic 
      systems. A sample of 94 Spanish children and 157 English-speaking Canadian
      children with RD was classified into four groups on the basis of IQ scores from
      the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (< 80; 81-90; 91-109;
      110-140). We examined the reading and spelling skills of Canadian and Spanish
      children as a function of Full Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ scores.
      Significant differences between the languages were found when reading performance
      was analyzed as a function of Verbal IQ scores, in that there were some
      differences between the groups of Canadian children with RD but not between the
      groups of Spanish children. The Canadian children with Verbal IQ scores < 80
      demonstrated relatively lower performance in reading and spelling skills than the
      Canadian groups with higher IQ scores. There were differences in reading tasks as
      a function of Performance IQ in English but not in Spanish. The differences in
      the role of IQ as a function of orthographic systems may relate to the greater
      significance of visual-orthographic as opposed to phonological processing in
      English.

TI  - Change detection is impaired in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 95-105
AB  - The severe deficits in rapid automatized naming demonstrated by children with
      developmental dyslexia has usually been interpreted in terms of a deficit in
      speed of access to the lexicon rather than as a possible deficit in speed of
      visual object recognition. Yet fluent reading requires rapid visual recognition
      and semantic interpretation of new letters and words appearing in successive
      fixations of the eyes. Thus we wondered whether change detection performance was 
      related to reading ability. We investigated whether children with developmental
      dyslexia (DD) were less able to detect change in a simple display--gap--display
      paradigm than normal reading (NR) children of the same age and children with
      impaired reading and mentation (LD). In a first experimental phase, the DDs
      required a longer initial exposure of four letter items in order to detect change
      of a single letter at a level of 71% correct, compared with NRs performing at the
      same level. Thus the deficit in reading in DD is associated with a deficit in
      early processes associated with visual recognition. In a second experimental
      phase (using the individual target display exposures measured in the first
      phase), cues appeared during the 250 ms gap for a period of either 0 (no cue), 50
      or 200 ms immediately prior to the presentation of the second (comparison)
      display. Children of all groups showed dependence on the presence of the cue to
      help make a judgement of change (versus no change), with the NRs least affected. 
      When change was detected in the presence of a cue, the NRs were better able to
      identify the new letter than either of the other groups. However, only about 50% 
      of the correct detections were accompanied by a correct identification. Despite
      published reports of a mini-neglect for left visual field in dyslexic adults,
      none of our groups showed such an effect. However, a significant upper visual
      field (UpVF) advantage in change detection performance was found across groups,
      which we interpret in terms of the interactions of the ventral and dorsal
      streams.

TI  - The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model.
PG  - 196-204
AB  - This review discusses recent cognitive neuroscience investigations into the
      biological bases of developmental dyslexia, a common disorder impacting
      approximately 5 to 17 percent of the population. Our aim is to summarize central 
      findings from several lines of evidence that converge on pivotal aspects of the
      brain bases of developmental dyslexia. We highlight ways in which the approaches 
      and methodologies of developmental cognitive neuroscience that are addressed in
      this special issue-including neuroimaging, human genetics, refinement of
      cognitive and biological phenotypes, neural plasticity and computational
      model-can be employed in uncovering the biological bases of this disorder. Taking
      a developmental perspective on the biological bases of dyslexia, we propose a
      simple cascading model for the developmental progression of this disorder, in
      which individual differences in brain areas associated with phonological
      processing might influence the specialization of visual areas involved in the
      rapid processing of written words. We also discuss recent efforts to understand
      the impact of successful reading interventions in terms of changes within
      cortical circuits associated with reading ability.

TI  - Implicit learning deficit in children with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - Several neuropsychological deficits have been reported as characteristic of the
      cognitive profile of dyslexic children. Phonological and visual processing are
      often impaired as well as auditory processing, attention and information
      processing speed. We investigated whether implicit learning, is impaired in
      dyslexic children and adolescents. Tests of implicit and declarative learning
      were administered to 18 clinically defined dyslexics and 18 similar age controls.
      Dyslexics showed a reduced learning rate in the implicit but not in the
      declarative task, suggesting a specific deficit of implicit learning. Although
      alternative hypothesis cannot be ruled out, considering that implicit learning is
      a cognitive function primarily processed by the cerebellum and that recent
      neurological and physiological data suggest a cerebellar dysfunction in dyslexia,
      the present results suggest an impairment of cerebellar system in reading
      disabilities.

TI  - [Stormorken's syndrome].
PG  - 2853-6
AB  - In 1985, a new syndrome with the following characteristics was described:
      thrombopathia, thrombopenia, asplenia, miosis, headache, ichthyosis, dyslexia,
      muscle defect, and subsequently also hypocalcaemia. Skin and deep bleedings, leg 
      spasms, disturbed dark vision and dyslexia are main worries. This paper describes
      these patients with a review of the investigations performed. Causes of the
      bleeding tendency are complex disturbances of the platelet membrane causing
      insufficient stability of the haemostatic plug, the nature of which is
      unresolved, but involves membrane scrambling. The muscle defect consists in
      tubular aggregates and high blood values of creatine kinase. A connection with
      the hypocalcaemia is possible, because increasing the ionic Ca with calcitriol
      significantly improves muscle function. Miosis is resistant to mydriatics and
      causes decreased dark vision, possibly also influencing dyslexia. The asplenia
      has little influence on immunocompetence, and the patients have survived 300
      patient years without critical infections. The gene defect has not yet been
      unravelled.

TI  - Sex differences in rapid auditory processing deficits in ectopic BXSB/MpJ mice.
PG  - 2277-80
AB  - Prior research with rodent models, performed predominantly in males, has
      demonstrated a significant association between focal neocortical malformations
      (e.g. ectopias and microgyria) and rate-specific auditory processing deficits. In
      the current study and consistent with prior findings, we report that ectopic male
      BXSB/MpJ mice exhibit impairments in detecting a two-tone oddball stimulus at
      short but not long inter-stimulus interval durations when compared to non-ectopic
      male littermates. However, ectopic female littermates showed no rapid auditory
      processing deficit when compared to non-ectopic females on this same task.
      Current results add growing support to: (1) an association between focal cortical
      malformations and impaired auditory processing in males; and (2) the existence of
      sex differences in the behavioral consequences of focal cortical malformations.

TI  - Auditory processing efficiency deficits in children with developmental language
      impairments.
PG  - 2962-6
AB  - The "temporal processing hypothesis" suggests that individuals with specific
      language impairments (SLIs) and dyslexia have severe deficits in processing
      rapidly presented or brief sensory information, both within the auditory and
      visual domains. This hypothesis has been supported through evidence that
      language-impaired individuals have excess auditory backward masking. This paper
      presents an analysis of masking results from several studies in terms of a model 
      of temporal resolution. Results from this modeling suggest that the masking
      results can be better explained by an "auditory efficiency" hypothesis. If
      impaired or immature listeners have a normal temporal window, but require a
      higher signal-to-noise level (poor processing efficiency), this hypothesis
      predicts the observed small deficits in the simultaneous masking task, and the
      much larger deficits in backward and forward masking tasks amongst those
      listeners. The difference in performance on these masking tasks is predictable
      from the compressive nonlinearity of the basilar membrane. The model also
      correctly predicts that backward masking (i) is more prone to training effects,
      (ii) has greater inter- and intrasubject variability, and (iii) increases less
      with masker level than do other masking tasks. These findings provide a new
      perspective on the mechanisms underlying communication disorders and auditory
      masking.

TI  - Atypical brain activation of reading processes in children with developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 867-71
AB  - Brain activation differences of reading-related processes between dyslexic and
      normal reading children were localized with functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). The children performed tasks that varied in visuospatial, orthographic,
      phonologic, and semantic processing demands. Enhanced activation of the left
      extrastriate cortex was found during all tasks in the dyslexic group. During
      orthographic processing, dyslexic children predominantly showed activation in the
      right prefrontal cortex, as also occurred during the visuo-spatial task. Normal
      readers also showed activation in the left prefrontal cortex. Dyslexic readers
      showed less activation of both the temporal and the prefrontal cortex during
      phonologic processing. The results suggest that dyslexic readers fail to use
      brain areas that are normally specialized in language processing, but rather use 
      areas that underlie visuospatial processing.

TI  - Atypical trajectories of number development: a neuroconstructivist perspective.
PG  - 511-516
AB  - Despite the fact that number deficits are as prevalent as literacy deficits,
      research on basic numerical skills lags seriously behind the successful studies
      identifying low-level deficits in dyslexia. We review current debates on number, 
      discussing how the competing theories pertain to mathematical disabilities in
      normal children and numeracy deficits in genetic disorders. We stress the need to
      consider these issues within the framework of a developing system rather than
      from the neuropsychological perspective of focal damage. The earlier the
      exploration of atypical trajectories in very basic numerical skills, the better
      we will be able to chart their developmental impact on subsequent, higher-level
      arithmetic abilities.

TI  - Development of early motor skills and language in children at risk for familial
      dyslexia.
PG  - 761-9
AB  - Differences in motor development and the relationship between motor and language 
      development were studied in 88 children with familial risk for dyslexia (43
      females, 45 males; at-risk group) and 88 children without familial risk for
      dyslexia (35 females, 53 females; control group; n=176) during the first two
      years of life. A structured parental questionnaire was used to assess motor
      development. Expressive language skills were assessed at the age of 18 months
      with the Reynell Developmental Language Scales and at 18 and 24 months with the
      MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories. At group level, the motor
      development of children in both the at-risk and control groups was similar.
      However, motor development showed a different pattern in these groups. Cluster
      analyses revealed three clusters in the control group: 'fast motor development', 
      'slow fine motor development', and 'slow gross motor development'. In the at-risk
      group, only two clusters were found: 'slow motor development' and 'fast motor
      development'. A significant difference (p=0.03) was found between the clusters in
      the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories. Children with familial risk 
      for dyslexia and slow motor development had a smaller vocabulary and produced
      shorter sentences than the all other children. Associations between motor and
      language difficulties are discussed.

TI  - Oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder: a review of the past 10
      years, part II.
PG  - 1275-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review empirical findings on oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)
      and conduct disorder (CD). METHOD: Selected summaries of the literature over the 
      past decade are presented. RESULTS: Research on ODD and CD during the past decade
      has addressed the complexity involved in identifying the primary risk factors and
      developmental pathways to disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). In some domains,
      research is entering an entirely new phase because of the availability of new
      technologies. In others, larger data sets and more complicated methodological and
      statistical techniques are testing increasingly complex models. Yet questions
      remain regarding the most useful subtyping systems, the identification of the
      most significant risk factors, and the relationships between risk factors from
      multiple domains. CONCLUSIONS: Convincing evidence of causal linkages remains
      elusive. Research has questioned the notion that CD is intractable, especially
      when multiple domains of risk and impairment are the targets of intervention. It 
      is apparent that there is not one single causative factor; thus it is not likely 
      that one single modality will suffice to treat CD. Future steps will involve the 
      restructuring of diagnostic criteria to capture adequate subtypes and indicators,
      clarification of the neurological underpinnings of the disorder, and refinement
      in the models available to explain the varied pathways to DBD.

TI  - [Reliability, trainability and stability of auditory discrimination performance
      in 2 computer-assisted assessment and training methods].
PG  - 261-70
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study focuses on the possibilities and effects of
      training dyslexic children in tone and phoneme discrimination tasks. METHODS: A
      computer program was developed to train dyslexic children to discriminate between
      tone and speech stimuli. The correlation between auditory discrimination and
      reading and orthography performance was then tested in a preliminary study of n =
      63 children. In a prospective study 44 children were assigned to one of three
      paralyzed groups: tone training, phoneme training or a control group. Upon
      completion of the initial diagnostics for all groups, the two training groups
      received four weeks of discrimination training, after which all three groups were
      immediately re-tested for the first time. Parallel thereto all children underwent
      specific training in reading and orthography at their school. Six months later
      all were re-tested a second time. RESULTS: Both test methods showed a high
      reliability (rn = .94; .95). Significant correlations between auditory
      discrimination and reading and orthography performance were confirmed. Auditory
      discrimination was significantly trainable. Specific training effects, as well as
      independent developmental effects were found. While the training effects of
      phoneme discrimination were stable over six months, those of tone discrimination 
      were not. CONCLUSION: The central auditory discrimination between tone and
      phoneme stimuli can be trained successfully in dyslexic children and might also
      affect their reading and orthography performance.

TI  - A genomewide screen for autism-spectrum disorders: evidence for a major
      susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q25-27.
PG  - 777-90
AB  - To identify genetic loci for autism-spectrum disorders, we have performed a
      two-stage genomewide scan in 38 Finnish families. The detailed clinical
      examination of all family members revealed infantile autism, but also Asperger
      syndrome (AS) and developmental dysphasia, in the same set of families. The most 
      significant evidence for linkage was found on chromosome 3q25-27, with a maximum 
      two-point LOD score of 4.31 (Z(max )(dom)) for D3S3037, using infantile autism
      and AS as an affection status. Six markers flanking over a 5-cM region on 3q gave
      Z(max dom) >3, and a maximum parametric multipoint LOD score (MLS) of 4.81 was
      obtained in the vicinity of D3S3715 and D3S3037. Association, linkage
      disequilibrium, and haplotype analyses provided some evidence for shared ancestor
      alleles on this chromosomal region among affected individuals, especially in the 
      regional subisolate. Additional potential susceptibility loci with two-point LOD 
      scores >2 were observed on chromosomes 1q21-22 and 7q. The region on 1q21-22
      overlaps with the previously reported candidate region for infantile autism and
      schizophrenia, whereas the region on chromosome 7q provided evidence for linkage 
      58 cM distally from the previously described autism susceptibility locus (AUTS1).

TI  - The association of abnormal cerebellar function in children with developmental
      coordination disorder and reading difficulties.
PG  - 234-48
AB  - Children with developmental coordination disorder/dyspraxia (DCD) are at high
      risk of reading and writing delay. The difficulties with motor skills are
      heterogeneous and many children have features of poor cerebellar function,
      reflected in problems with posture, balance and fast accurate control of
      movement. This study confirmed a high level of parental reporting of reading and 
      writing delay in a clinical group of 23 children with DCD, defined on the basis
      of both clinical examination and standardized testing of motor function. Direct
      measurement of reading delay, identified still further children in the group.
      Those children with reading delay had associated findings typical of phonological
      awareness difficulties. The children also underwent a standardized test of
      neurological function and although they all had difficulties with cerebellar
      function, no distinctive pattern emerged for those whose presentation was
      complicated by delayed reading and writing. Both the children with DCD and 136
      typically developing children, completed the pilot parental questionnaire on
      gross motor skills. The three skills of catching a ball, jumping on a moving
      playground roundabout and handwriting, distinguished the children with DCD. This 
      study therefore confirms that children with DCD should be assessed for
      difficulties in phonological awareness. Additionally, children aged between 7 and
      12 years are on the whole, highly competent in a range of gross motor skills and 
      further study might determine whether a simple parental questionnaire might
      detect children who would benefit from further assessment. The study also
      suggests that all the children with DCD have cerebellar dysfunction and further
      work with a larger group might determine particular patterns associated with
      reading delay.

TI  - Comments on 'The dyslexia ecosystem': a reply to Nicolson.
PG  - 226-33
AB  - The central issue facing the dyslexia community, and the underlying theme of
      Nicolson's 'The Dyslexia Ecosystem' (Nicolson, 2002, Dyslexia, 8, 55-66), is how 
      we can best translate what we know about this particular developmental disorder
      into practice to give each child the greatest opportunity of acquiring the
      enabling skill of literacy. To achieve this, and notwithstanding Nicolson's
      caveat on this point, we have to consider how we can best move from our sphere of
      expertise to a greater sphere of influence, both as individuals and as a
      community of research practitioners. In our response, we first consider aspects
      of Nicolson's general analysis of 'The Dyslexia Ecosystem' and then examine some 
      of the specific objectives that have been proposed.

TI  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: comorbidity and medication use.
PG  - 461-9
AB  - Children evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have
      other disorders resembling ADHD leading to inappropriate stimulant medication
      use. This study was completed to identify relationships between referral
      complaints of ADHD, behavior problems or learning problems and age, gender, final
      diagnosis, and medication use. One hundred eighty-nine children ages 2 to 15
      years referred for evaluation of ADHD, behavior or learning problems were
      evaluated by an interdisciplinary team. Diagnoses of ADHD, specific learning
      disability (SLD), mental retardation (MR), developmental language disorders
      (LANG), and other behavior disorders (DIS) were established. Medication use pre- 
      and post-evaluation was reviewed. Forty-three percent of all subjects had a final
      diagnosis of ADHD. Forty percent referred specifically for presumed ADHD did not 
      have it. More children older than 5 years were diagnosed as having ADHD than
      those 5 years old or younger (p < 0.0001). More subjects 5 years old or younger
      were diagnosed as having LANG than those older than 5 years (p < 0.0001). Fewer
      subjects with a chief complaint of ADHD were diagnosed with MR than those with
      behavior or learning problems (p = 0.001). In subjects 5 years old or younger,
      35% were diagnosed with MR and 49% with other DIS. In children older than 5
      years, 41% were diagnosed with SLD. Ten percent of subjects without ADHD were
      using stimulants. Only 48% of subjects with confirmed ADHD took stimulants.
      Children presenting with behavior problems or those 5 years old or younger are at
      higher risk for MR, LANG, and DIS and less likely to have ADHD. Children
      presenting with learning problems or those older than 5 years are more likely to 
      have SLD or ADHD. Multiple diagnoses were common for all ages and presentations. 
      Ten percent of children without confirmed ADHD used stimulants before evaluation.

TI  - Separate influences of acoustic AM and FM sensitivity on the phonological
      decoding skills of impaired and normal readers.
PG  - 866-74
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is associated with deficits in the processing of basic
      auditory stimuli. Yet it is unclear how these sensory impairments might
      contribute to poor reading skills. This study better characterizes the
      relationship between phonological decoding skills, the lack of which is generally
      accepted to comprise the core deficit in reading disabilities, and auditory
      sensitivity to amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).
      Thirty-eight adult subjects, 17 of whom had a history of developmental dyslexia, 
      completed a battery of psychophysical measures of sensitivity to FM and AM at
      different modulation rates, along with a measure of pseudoword reading accuracy
      and standardized assessments of literacy and cognitive skills. The subjects with 
      a history of dyslexia were significantly less sensitive than controls to 2-Hz FM 
      and 20-Hz AM only. The absence of a significant group difference for 2-Hz AM
      shows that the dyslexics do not have a general deficit in detecting all slow
      modulations. Thresholds for detecting 2-Hz and 240-Hz FM and 20-Hz AM correlated 
      significantly with pseudoword reading accuracy. After accounting for various
      cognitive skills, however, multiple regression analyses showed that detection
      thresholds for both 2-Hz FM and 20-Hz AM were significant and independent
      predictors of pseudoword reading ability in the entire sample. Thresholds for
      2-Hz AM and 240-Hz FM did not explain significant additional variance in
      pseudoword reading skill. It is therefore possible that certain components of
      auditory processing of modulations are related to phonological decoding skills,
      whereas others are not.

TI  - Form and motion coherence processing in dyspraxia: evidence of a global spatial
      processing deficit.
PG  - 1399-402
AB  - Form and motion coherence was tested in children with dyspraxia and matched
      controls to assess their global spatial and global motion processing abilities.
      Thresholds for detecting form coherence patterns were significantly higher in the
      dyspraxic group than in the control group. No corresponding difference was found 
      on the motion coherence task. We tested eight children with dyspraxic disorder
      (mean age 8.2 years) and 50 verbal-mental-age matched controls (mean age 8.4
      years) to test for a neural basis to the perceptual abnormalities observed in
      dyspraxia. The results provide evidence that children with dyspraxia have a
      specific impairment in the global processing of spatial information. This finding
      contrasts with other developmental disorders such as Williams syndrome, autism
      and dyslexia where deficits have been found in global motion processing and not
      global form processing. We conclude that children with dyspraxia may have a
      specific occipitotemporal deficit and we argue that testing form and motion
      coherence thresholds might be a useful diagnostic tool for the often coexistent
      disorders of dyspraxia and dyslexia.

TI  - Amplitude envelope onsets and developmental dyslexia: A new hypothesis.
PG  - 10911-6
AB  - A core difficulty in developmental dyslexia is the accurate specification and
      neural representation of speech. We argue that a likely perceptual cause of this 
      difficulty is a deficit in the perceptual experience of rhythmic timing. Speech
      rhythm is one of the earliest cues used by infants to discriminate syllables and 
      is determined principally by the acoustic structure of amplitude modulation at
      relatively low rates in the signal. We show significant differences between
      dyslexic and normally reading children, and between young early readers and
      normal developers, in amplitude envelope onset detection. We further show that
      individual differences in sensitivity to the shape of amplitude modulation
      account for 25% of the variance in reading and spelling acquisition even after
      controlling for individual differences in age, nonverbal IQ, and vocabulary. A
      possible causal explanation dependent on perceptual-center detection and the
      onset-rime representation of syllables is discussed.

TI  - Disconnection of speech-relevant brain areas in persistent developmental
      stuttering.
PG  - 380-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The neuronal basis of persistent developmental stuttering is unknown.
      The disorder could be related to a reduced left hemisphere dominance, which
      functional neuroimaging data suggest might lead to right hemispheric motor and
      premotor overactivation. Alternatively, the core deficit underlying stuttering
      might be located in the speech-dominant left hemisphere. Furthermore,
      magnetoencephalography study results show profound timing disturbances between
      areas involved in language preparation and execution in the left hemisphere,
      suggesting that persistent developmental stuttering might be related to impaired 
      neuronal communication, possibly caused by a disruption of white matter fibre
      tracts. We aimed to establish whether disconnection between speech-related
      cortical areas was the structural basis of persistent developmental stuttering.
      METHODS: We analysed the speech of 15 people with persistent developmental
      stuttering and 15 closely matched controls for the percentage of syllables
      stuttered. We used diffusion tensor imaging to assess participants' brain tissue 
      structure, and used and two-sample t test to compare diffusion characteristics
      between groups. FINDINGS: Diffusion characteristics of the group with persistent 
      developmental stuttering and controls differed significantly immediately below
      the laryngeal and tongue representation in the left sensorimotor cortex (mean
      difference in fractional anisotropy 0.04 [95% CI 0.03-0.05]). INTERPRETATION: Our
      findings show that persistent developmental stuttering results from disturbed
      timing of activation in speech-relevant brain areas, and suggest that right
      hemisphere overactivation merely reflects a compensatory mechanism, analogous to 
      right hemisphere activation in aphasia.

AB  - The minicolumn is an anatomical and functional unit of the brain whose genesis
      accrues from germinal cell divisions in the ventricular zone of the brain.
      Disturbances in the morphometry of minicolumns have been demonstrated recently
      for both autism and Down's syndrome. We report minicolumnar abnormalities in the 
      brain of a dyslexic patient. The corresponding developmental disturbance (ie,
      large minicolumns) could account for the perceptual errors observed in dyslexia.

TI  - The cognitive profile and multiple-deficit hypothesis in Chinese developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 543-53
AB  - The present study was conducted to examine the cognitive profile and
      multiple-deficit hypothesis in Chinese developmental dyslexia. Thirty Chinese
      dyslexic children in Hong Kong were compared with 30 average readers of the same 
      chronological age (CA controls) and 30 average readers of the same reading level 
      (RL controls) in a number of rapid naming, visual, phonological, and orthographic
      tasks. Chinese dyslexic children performed significantly worse than the CA
      controls but similarly to the RL controls on most of the cognitive tasks. The
      rapid naming deficit was found to be the most dominant type of cognitive deficit 
      in Chinese dyslexic children. Over half of the dyslexic children exhibited
      deficits in 3 or more cognitive areas, and there was a significant association
      between the number of cognitive deficits and the degree of reading and spelling
      impairment. The present findings support the multiple-deficit hypothesis in
      Chinese developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Surface and phonological subtypes of adult developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 160-77
AB  - In order to assess the efficacy of phonological versus surface dyslexia subtyping
      within an adult dyslexic population, 45 adult dyslexics were assessed on the
      Castles and Coltheart (1993) irregular word and non-word reading tasks. Based on 
      the performance of a matched group of 28 non-dyslexics, between 62 and 75% of the
      dyslexics were divided into phonological and surface subtypes. Phonological
      dyslexics were those individuals who presented evidence of relatively poor or
      inefficient non-word reading, whereas the surface dyslexics were those who
      indicated relative difficulties with irregular word reading. The proportions of
      dyslexics within each subtype varied according to the use of accuracy-based or
      latency-based procedures, but were consistent with previous findings with
      children. Subsequent comparisons between the groups on measures of phonological
      processing, lexical access and word knowledge/recognition indicated few
      differences between the two subtypes and, in particular, no differences on
      measures of phonological ability. The lack of observed differences on such
      measures casts doubt on the efficacy of this procedure for explaining individual 
      differences amongst adult dyslexics and as a practical procedure for diagnosis
      and intervention.

      dyslexia: case report].
PG  - 328-32
AB  - We describe the work of the interdisciplinary staff of FCM/UNICAMP for the
      diagnosis of developmental dyslexia, evaluating a 9 years old boy from the second
      year of a first grade public school. The procedure consisted of four stages: 1)
      Interview with the mother (anamnesis); 2) neuropsychological evaluation; 3)
      specific evaluation for reading and writing skills; 4) complementary exams. The
      results revealed that the child presented normal intelligence, normal auditory
      and visual function but difficulties in reading specific test, in auditory
      short-term memory (specially in auditory sequences), and in phonological
      conscience, as well as slowness, lack of concentration, slight neurological signs
      and hypoperfusion of the mesial portion of the temporal lobe. These data suggest 
      that the child has developmental dyslexia of mixed type, requiring
      psychopedagogic follow-up.

TI  - Clinical implications of a link between fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 349-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the animal and human research literature on 
      the link between fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: We conducted a comprehensive literature
      review that addressed the history of, and current research on, fetal alcohol
      syndrome (FAS) and FASD, as well as that on ADHD in children. RESULTS: In animal 
      and human research, there is emerging clinical, neuropsychological, and
      neurochemical evidence of a link between FASD and ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence
      of the link between these 2 conditions has implications for clinical management. 
      The clinical quality of ADHD in children with FASD often differs from that of
      children without FASD. For children with FASD, ADHD is more likely to be the
      earlier-onset, inattention subtype, with comorbid developmental, psychiatric, and
      medical conditions. Children with FASD are commonly not mentally retarded but
      present complex learning disabilities, especially a mixed receptive-expressive
      language disorder with deficits in social cognition and communication
      (reminiscent of sensory aphasia and apraxia), working memory problems, and
      frequently, a mathematics disorder. Comorbid psychiatric conditions include
      anxiety, mood, conduct, or explosive disorders. As well, cardiac, renal, or
      skeletal problems are more likely to be present. Because these children have a
      disturbance in brain neurochemistry, or even brain structure (that is, in the
      corpus callosum), their response to standard psychostimulant medication can be
      quite unpredictable.

TI  - [Insights into brain function though magnetic source imaging: A review of
      research and clinical applications].
PG  - 871-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: The paper presents a brief outline of the rationale
      behind the use of non invasive functional imaging and of the features that any
      imaging technique should display in order to make a substantial contribution to
      the search of the brain mechanisms responsible for cognitive functions. One such 
      technique, magnetic source imaging (MSI), that meets these specifications, is
      described in more detail. Advantages of MSI include the capacity to provide
      direct measures of regional neurophysiological activity, a millisecond range
      temporal resolution, and the capacity to provide images of brain activity on an
      individual basis. We then describe applications of MSI to the study of brain
      mechanisms involved in various language functions such as oral comprehension and 
      reading. Among these applications, the accuracy of MSI protocols in determining
      hemispheric dominance for language functions and in identifying the precise
      location and extent language specific cortex (Wernicke s area) has been verified 
      through comparison with standard invasive techniques (Wada procedure and
      electrocortical stimulation mapping) in over 60 consecutive cases. In another
      series of studies we combined data from MSI and direct cortical stimulation to
      determine the role of temporoparietal areas in phonological analysis of spoken
      language and in phonological decoding of print. Finally, we have used MSI to gain
      unique insights into the brain mechanisms that support reading in developmental
      reading disability. CONCLUSION: Results from over 21 children diagnosed with this
      disorder suggest that impaired reading is associated with aberrant functional
      connections between temporal and temporoparietal areas of the left hemisphere
      that are normally engaged in reading.

TI  - Crowding effects on word identification in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 179-200
AB  - The effect of crowding on the identification of words was examined in normal
      readers and subjects with developmental dyslexia. In Experiment 1, a matching
      task was used. Words were presented either alone or embedded in other words.
      Vocal reaction times (RT) of dyslexics were slower and more sensitive to the
      presence of the surrounding stimuli than those of control subjects. Similar
      results were obtained in a control experiment using the same task for strings of 
      symbols (isolated or crowded) instead of words. These data indicate that
      differences in crowding in control and dyslexic subjects arise at a
      pre-linguistic level. In Experiment 2, vocal RTs to word reading were measured.
      Two conditions putatively reducing the effect of crowding were tested: increasing
      inter-letter spacing and blurring. A moderate increase of inter-letter spacing
      produced faster vocal RTs in dyslexics, while no effect was present in normal
      controls. Moderate blurring of stimuli did not change dyslexics' RTs, while
      normal readers became slower. Group and individual results are discussed to
      evaluate the extent to which crowding contributes to the genesis of developmental
      dyslexia.

TI  - Brain mechanisms in normal and dyslexic readers.
PG  - 178-83
AB  - Developmental dyslexics, individuals with an unexplained difficulty reading, have
      been shown to have deficits in phonological processing -- the awareness of the
      sound structure of words -- and, in some cases, a more fundamental deficit in
      rapid auditory processing. In addition, dyslexics show a disruption in white
      matter connectivity between posterior and frontal regions. These results give
      continued support for a neurobiological etiology of developmental dyslexia.
      However, more research will be required to determine the possible causal
      relationships between these neurobiological disruptions and dyslexia.

TI  - Deficits of motion transparency perception in adult developmental dyslexics with 
      normal unidirectional motion sensitivity.
PG  - 1195-203
AB  - We assessed motion integration ability in seven adult developmental dyslexics
      using unidirectional and bidirectional (transparent) random dot kinematograms
      (RDKs) that varied in the number of frames. All adult dyslexics performed as well
      as normally reading age-matched controls with unidirectional RDKs, regardless of 
      frame number. However, using orthogonal motion transparent stimuli, deficits were
      obvious in six dyslexics and depended on frame number. Whereas controls needed on
      average only 4.4 frames (144 ms) to identify both directions correctly on 75% of 
      presentations, dyslexics needed on average 14.6 frames (483 ms) to achieve this
      level of performance. Even though a unidirectional motion task failed to reveal
      processing abnormalities in adult dyslexics, the motion transparency task was
      effective at revealing significant perceptual dysfunction, suggesting that
      performance on this task is a better psychophysical indicator of visual motion
      deficits in dyslexia. This finding provides little support for the magnocellular 
      deficit hypothesis and, rather, points to abnormality within dorsal extrastriate 
      cortical areas that subserve the integration and segmentation of complex motion
      signals.

      modulations in university students with and without developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 520-6
AB  - To help resolve the issue of whether developmental dyslexia (DD) is related to
      central auditory processing deficits or to language-specific processing deficits,
      we had nine dyslectic and nine nondyslectic right-handed undergraduate students
      perform linguistic (Experiment 1: phoneme identification) and nonlinguistic
      (Experiment 2: formant rate change detection) tasks. In Experiment 1, subjects
      listened to synthetic vowels whose second formant (F2) was modulated sinusoidally
      with F1, F3, and F4 held constant. F2 modulation rate (4-18 Hz) was manipulated
      within and across stimuli. The groups did not differ in phoneme identification.
      Experiment 2 was run three times and showed that the control subjects'
      performance improved across runs whereas the dyslexics' deteriorated across runs 
      (p < .0001), suggesting practice and fatigue effects, respectively. Performance
      on the two experiments correlated significantly and negatively for the dyslexic
      subjects only. These results suggest that resource depletion or frontal lobe
      dysfunction may be implicated in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Coherence of hemispheric function in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - Left parieto-occipital EEG leads record a frequency spectrum in dyslexics that is
      consistently different from the spectrum obtained from normals. It is suggested
      that these effects represent significant differences in the functional
      organization of these areas. EEG coherence values indicate that normals have
      significantly greater sharing between hemispheres at symmetrical locations.
      Dyslexics demonstrate significantly greater sharing within hemisphere than do
      normals. The data supports developmental dyslexia being a functional hemispheric 
      disconnection syndrome.

TI  - The timing deficit hypothesis of dyslexia and its implications for Hebrew
      reading.
PG  - 394-8
AB  - Vast amounts of neuropsychological evidence have been collected in recent years
      in support of the hypothesis that developmental dyslexia is caused not only by
      phonological deficits, but also by timing deficits that affect all senses (e.g., 
      Tallal, Miller, & Fitch, 1995; Stein & Walsh, 1997). In parallel, recent
      developments in the study of Hebrew reading place heavy emphasis on root
      awareness in the mental lexicon and early root extraction in the process of word 
      identification (e.g., Frost, Forster, & Deutch, 1997). The present study creates 
      a link between the timing hypothesis and the special demands of Hebrew reading.
      The performance of dyslexics and normally reading children is compared on tasks
      requiring visual extraction of trigrams that approximates extracting roots out of
      Hebrew words. Partial findings show that dyslexics take longer and make more
      errors while performing trigram extractions on all levels examined, and that
      sequentiality in the task affects dyslexics and skilled readers in different
      ways.

TI  - Reading words and pseudowords: an eye movement study of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 617-26
AB  - The pattern of eye movements during reading was studied in 12 developmental
      dyslexics and in 10 age-matched controls. According to standard reading
      batteries, dyslexics showed marked reading slowness and prevalently used the
      sublexical procedure in reading. Eye movements were recorded while they read
      lists of short and long words or pseudowords. In normal readers, saccade
      amplitude increased with word length without a concomitant change in the number
      of saccades; in contrast, the number of saccades increased for long pseudowords. 
      In dyslexics, the eye movement pattern was different. The number of saccades
      depended on stimulus length for both words and pseudowords while saccade
      amplitude remained small and constant. The sequential scanning shown by dyslexics
      for both words and pseudowords appears consistent with the cognitive description 
      of the reading disorder which indicates the preferential use of the sublexical
      print-to-sound correspondence rules.

TI  - Temporal processing and phonological impairment in dyslexia: effect of phoneme
      lengthening on order judgment of two consonants.
PG  - 576-91
AB  - The evidence of supporting phonological deficit as a cause of developmental
      dyslexia has been accumulating rapidly over the past 2 decades, yet the exact
      mechanisms underlying this deficit remain controversial. Some authors assume that
      a temporal processing deficit is the source of the phonological disorder observed
      in dyslexic children. Others maintain that the phonological deficit in dyslexia
      is basically linguistic, not acoustic, in nature. Three experiments were
      conducted and tested the impact of the temporal alteration and the impact of
      complex syllabic structure on consonant order judgments. Thirteen phonological
      dyslexics (age 10-13) and 10 controls matched for chronologial age were compared 
      on a Temporal Order Judgment (TOJ) task using the succession of two consonants
      (/p/ /s/) within a cluster. In order to test the possible relevance of the
      temporal deficit hypothesis, the task also included two additional conditions
      where either the two stimuli were artificially slowed or two phonological
      structures were opposed (CCV and CVCV). As expected, the TOJ performance was
      significantly poorer in dyslexics than in controls. Moreover, in the "slowed
      speech" condition dyslexics' performance improved to reach the normal controls'
      level, whereas manipulating the phonological structure complexity provided no
      significant improvement. Finally dyslexics' performances, especially on the
      slowed condition, were found correlated with several tests of phonological
      processing. These results lend support to the general temporal deficit theory of 
      dyslexia.

TI  - Crossmodal temporal order and processing acuity in developmentally dyslexic young
      adults.
PG  - 340-54
AB  - We investigated crossmodal temporal performance in processing rapid sequential
      nonlinguistic events in developmentally dyslexic young adults (ages 20-36 years) 
      and an age- and IQ-matched control group in audiotactile, visuotactile, and
      audiovisual combinations. Two methods were used for estimating 84% correct
      temporal acuity thresholds: temporal order judgment (TOJ) and temporal processing
      acuity (TPA). TPA requires phase difference detection: the judgment of
      simultaneity/nonsimultaneity of brief stimuli in two parallel, spatially separate
      triplets. The dyslexic readers' average temporal performance was somewhat poorer 
      in all six comparisons; in audiovisual comparisons the group differences were not
      statistically significant, however. A principal component analysis indicated that
      temporal acuity and phonological awareness are related in dyslexic readers. The
      impairment of temporal input processing seems to be a general correlative feature
      of dyslexia in children and adults, but the overlap in performance between
      dyslexic and normal readers suggests that it is not a sufficient reason for
      developmental reading difficulties.

TI  - Eyeblink conditioning indicates cerebellar abnormality in dyslexia.
PG  - 42-50
AB  - There is increasing evidence that cerebellar deficit may be a causal factor in
      dyslexia. The cerebellum is considered to be the major structure involved in
      classical conditioning of the eyeblink response. In a direct test of cerebellar
      function in learning, 13 dyslexic participants (mean age 19.5 years) and 13
      control participants matched for age and IQ undertook an eyeblink conditioning
      experiment in which for 60 acquisition trials an 800-ms auditory tone
      (conditioned stimulus, CS) was presented. On 70% of the trials an 80-ms corneal
      airpuff (unconditioned stimulus, US) was presented 720 ms after the tone onset.
      The cerebellar deficit hypothesis, uniquely of the causal hypotheses for
      dyslexia, predicts that the dyslexic participants would show abnormal performance
      in the incidence and/or timing of the conditioned response (CR) of an eyeblink in
      response to the tone (and before the US). Three of the dyslexic group showed no
      conditioning at all. Furthermore, the dyslexic group showed significantly worse
      "tuning" of the CR timing, together with significantly reduced habituation of the
      orienting response (OR) to the CS. Individual analyses indicated that 85% of the 
      dyslexic group showed either no conditioning or abnormally poor CR tuning and/or 
      abnormally low OR habituation. It is concluded that the findings provide further 
      converging evidence of cerebellar abnormality in dyslexia and for the first time 
      demonstrate that there are fundamental abnormalities in the way that dyslexic
      people learn. Equally important, the eye blink conditioning paradigm provides a
      method of investigating further both homogeneity and heterogeneity in the
      learning deficits underlying dyslexia and other developmental disorders.

      features, and management.
PG  - 93-8
AB  - Arachnoid cysts are developmental anomalies that are most often diagnosed in
      childhood. They are often discovered as incidental findings found on imaging.
      Occasionally they may produce symptoms because of expansion or bleeding. There
      may be underlying maldevelopment of the cortex especially the temporal lobe.
      There is controversy regarding the role and the type of surgery indicated in its 
      treatment. Recent descriptions of aphasia and attention-deficit disorders
      associated with these cysts indicate that we do not fully understand this entity.
      There is also no acceptable explanation for the male preponderance and increased 
      incidence on the left side. The distribution, clinical features, treatment
      modalities, and some unusual syndromes associated with arachnoid cysts in
      children are discussed in this review.

TI  - Auditory frequency discrimination in adult developmental dyslexics.
PG  - 169-79
AB  - Developmental dyslexics reportedly discriminate auditory frequency poorly. A
      recent study found no such deficit. Unlike its predecessors, however, it employed
      multiple exposures per trial to the standard stimulus. To investigate whether
      this affects frequency discrimination in dyslexics, a traditional two-interval
      same-different paradigm (2I_1A_X) and a variant with six A-stimuli per trial
      (2I_6A_X) were used here. Frequency varied around 500 Hz; interstimulus interval 
      (ISI) ranged between 0 and 1,000 msec. Under 2I_1A_X, dyslexics always had larger
      just noticeable differences (JNDs) than did controls. Dyslexic and control JNDs
      were equal at shorter ISIs under 2I_6A_X, but dyslexics became worse than
      controls at longer ISIs. Signal detection analysis suggests that both sensory
      variance and trace variance are larger in dyslexics than in controls.

TI  - Dyslexia and familial high blood pressure: an observational pilot study.
PG  - 30-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental learning disability
      characterised by unexpectedly poor reading and unknown aetiology. One hypothesis 
      proposes excessive platelet activating factor, a potent vasodilator, as a
      contributor, implying that there should be a negative association between
      dyslexia and high blood pressure (HBP). Since both conditions have a partial
      genetic basis, this association may be apparent at the familial level. AIMS: To
      test this prediction in dyslexic and non-dyslexic children. METHODS: Individuals 
      and families with (HBP+) and without (HBP-) a family history of HBP were
      compared. RESULTS: Proportionately fewer dyslexics (49/112) than controls (11/12)
      were HBP+. Families with multiple, all dyslexic children were less likely to be
      HBP+ (7/16) than those with a non-dyslexic child (11/11). Within families, mean
      child scores on reading were higher in the HBP+ group (mean 44.3, SE 0.95) than
      in the HBP- group (mean 40.3, SE 0.87). CONCLUSION: HBP+ family history is
      associated with better performance on reading. The prediction of a negative
      association between dyslexic status and familial high blood pressure is therefore
      confirmed.

TI  - Deaf poor readers' pattern reversal visual evoked potentials suggest
      magnocellular system deficits: implications for diagnostic neuroimaging of
      dyslexia in deaf individuals.
PG  - 21-44
AB  - Deafness and developmental dyslexia in the same individual may jointly limit the 
      acquisition of reading skills for different underlying reasons. A diagnostic
      marker for dyslexia in deaf individuals must therefore detect the presence of a
      neurobiologically based dyslexia but be insensitive to the ordinary developmental
      influences of deafness on reading skill development. We propose that the
      functional status of the magnocellular visual system in deaf individuals is
      potentially such a marker. We present visual evoked potential (VEP) evidence that
      adult deaf poor readers as a group display magnocellular system deficits not
      observed in deaf good readers. We recorded pattern-reversal VEPs to high- and
      low-contrast checkerboard stimuli, which primarily activate the parvocellular and
      magnocellular pathways, respectively. Principal components analysis of these VEPs
      produced a time-ordered sequence of three early components that displayed
      interactions between reading skill and stimulus contrast across multiple scalp
      recording sites. Deaf poor readers displayed an abnormal absence of
      contrast-sensitive VEP responses at occipital sites during early visual
      processing (75 ms poststimulus), whereas deaf good readers showed the expected
      early contrast-sensitive occipital VEP responses. Over the subsequent 225 ms, the
      occipital VEP behavior of deaf poor readers closely approximated that of deaf
      good readers. The VEPs of deaf poor readers were apparently characterized by
      delayed responses to low-contrast stimuli compared with deaf good readers. Our
      results provide the first neurobiological evidence that developmental dyslexia
      exists within the deaf population and is associated with the same underlying
      magnocellular system deficit that has been observed in hearing dyslexics. Direct 
      neural imaging of the status of the magnocellular visual system in deaf
      individuals may eventually provide differential diagnosis of developmental
      dyslexia in the deaf population.

TI  - Brain responses to changes in speech sound durations differ between infants with 
      and without familial risk for dyslexia.
PG  - 407-22
AB  - A specific learning disability, developmental dyslexia, is a language-based
      disorder that is shown to be strongly familial. Therefore, infants born to
      families with a history of the disorder are at an elevated risk for the disorder.
      However, little is known of the potential early markers of dyslexia. Here we
      report differences between 6-month-old infants with and without high risk of
      familial dyslexia in brain electrical activation generated by changes in the
      temporal structure of speech sounds, a critical cueing feature in speech. We
      measured event-related brain responses to consonant duration changes embedded in 
      ata pseudowords applying an oddball paradigm, in which pseudoword tokens with
      varying /t/ duration were presented as frequent standard (80%) or as rare deviant
      stimuli (each 10%) with an interval of 610 msec between the stimuli. The infants 
      at risk differ from control infants in both their initial responsiveness to
      sounds per se and in their change-detection responses dependent on the stimulus
      context. These results show that infants at risk due to a familial background of 
      reading problems process auditory temporal cues of speech sounds differently from
      infants without such a risk even before they learn to speak.

TI  - Impaired processing of brief, rapidly presented auditory cues in infants with a
      family history of autoimmune disorder.
PG  - 351-72
AB  - Studies have shown that individuals with language disorders, such as
      developmental dyslexia and specific language impairment, exhibit impairments in
      the processing of brief, successive, or rapidly changing auditory information. It
      is also the case that a higher rate of autoimmune disorders have been identified 
      in those with language-based learning disorders and, conversely, that individuals
      with autoimmune disorders show a higher incidence of language-related disorders. 
      The rapid auditory processing (RAP) deficits described for older individuals with
      language impairments may also be used as a behavioral marker to identify infants 
      at higher risk for language delays. Thus, we were interested in examining RAP
      abilities in a subset of infants with a positive family history of autoimmune
      disorders. Eleven infants from our ongoing prospective longitudinal studies were 
      identified based on parental response to a question about the presence of a
      family history of autoimmune disease and compared to 11 matched controls. The RAP
      threshold of each infant was assessed at 6 and 9 months of age using a
      conditioned head-turn procedure (using tone pairs with brief interstimulus
      intervals) and an auditory-visual habituation-recognition memory task using
      computer-generated consonant-vowel syllables (/ba/ vs. /da/). A visual
      habituation-recognition memory task that did not require processing of brief
      temporal cues was also administered. Group differences emerged on the infant RAP 
      tasks, and on language outcome measures at 12 and 16 months of age. Infants from 
      families with a history of autoimmune disorder had significantly higher (i.e.,
      poorer) RAP thresholds and lower language scores than did control infants,
      whereas visual discrimination scores did not differ between family history
      infants and controls. Moreover, when brief auditory cues were necessary for the
      discrimination of /ba/ vs. /da/, infants with a family history of autoimmune
      disorder performed significantly more poorly than did controls. These findings
      lend support to the hypothesis that a similar mechanism, perhaps a neural-immune 
      interaction, may underlie the observed co-occurrence of autoimmune disorders and 
      learning impairments.

TI  - Planum temporale asymmetry and ear advantage in dichotic listening in
      Developmental Dyslexia and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
PG  - 22-36
AB  - The planum temporale is clearly involved in language processing, for it serves as
      the auditory association cortex. Research has consistently demonstrated that 60
      to 70% of the population has leftward asymmetry of the planum temporale. Research
      has also suggested that dyslexic individuals tend to have either rightward
      asymmetry or symmetrical plana. Moreover, many studies have found a relationship 
      between the presence of dyslexia and/or language impairment and deficits in the
      normal right ear advantage found in dichotic listening paradigms. In this
      context, this study examined the relationship between planum temporale asymmetry 
      and ear preference in dichotic listening performance in children with
      Developmental Dyslexia and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
      Subjects included 19 children with dyslexia (10 of whom had a comorbid diagnosis 
      of ADHD), 23 children with ADHD, and 12 diagnosed normal control children.
      Dichotic listening data were not collected for 8 of the 12 normal control
      children and for 3 of the 23 ADHD children. Results revealed no significant
      difference between ADHD and dyslexic subjects in regard to ear advantage on the
      free recall dichotic listening task. In addition, although the directed dichotic 
      listening tasks were not related to degree of planum asymmetry, as predicted,
      results indicated that subjects who consistently displayed an atypical left ear
      advantage tended to have larger right bank lengths than those who consistently
      displayed a typical right ear advantage. These findings support the notion that
      some individuals with dyslexia or language deficits tend to have a larger right
      planum temporale and that performance on dichotic listening tasks may reflect
      this relatively unusual pattern.

TI  - Independent genome-wide scans identify a chromosome 18 quantitative-trait locus
      influencing dyslexia.
PG  - 86-91
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is defined as a specific and significant impairment in
      reading ability that cannot be explained by deficits in intelligence, learning
      opportunity, motivation or sensory acuity. It is one of the most frequently
      diagnosed disorders in childhood, representing a major educational and social
      problem. It is well established that dyslexia is a significantly heritable trait 
      with a neurobiological basis. The etiological mechanisms remain elusive, however,
      despite being the focus of intensive multidisciplinary research. All attempts to 
      map quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) influencing dyslexia susceptibility have
      targeted specific chromosomal regions, so that inferences regarding genetic
      etiology have been made on the basis of very limited information. Here we present
      the first two complete QTL-based genome-wide scans for this trait, in large
      samples of families from the United Kingdom and United States. Using single-point
      analysis, linkage to marker D18S53 was independently identified as being one of
      the most significant results of the genome in each scan (P< or =0.0004 for single
      word-reading ability in each family sample). Multipoint analysis gave increased
      evidence of 18p11.2 linkage for single-word reading, yielding top empirical P
      values of 0.00001 (UK) and 0.0004 (US). Measures related to phonological and
      orthographic processing also showed linkage at this locus. We replicated linkage 
      to 18p11.2 in a third independent sample of families (from the UK), in which the 
      strongest evidence came from a phoneme-awareness measure (most significant P
      value=0.00004). A combined analysis of all UK families confirmed that this newly 
      discovered 18p QTL is probably a general risk factor for dyslexia, influencing
      several reading-related processes. This is the first report of QTL-based
      genome-wide scanning for a human cognitive trait.

TI  - Mixed lateralization of phonological assembly in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - Developmental phonological dyslexia has been characterized as a deficit in
      phonological assembly. At a neural level, it is possible that this deficit is
      represented by weak connectivity between anterior and posterior language systems 
      in the left hemisphere. This study used 3-Tesla functional magnetic resonance
      imaging to investigate phonological assembly in a developmental phonological
      dyslexic. The phonological dyslexic showed increased activation in the left
      hemisphere of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44/6) and increased activation in
      the right hemisphere of the parietal cortex (BA 7), occipital cortex (BA 18), and
      in the cerebellum, as phonological demands were systematically increased.
      Converging evidence suggests that the core dysfunction in phonological dyslexia
      resides in and around the angular gyrus of the left hemisphere. This study
      supports the compensatory role of posterior regions in the right hemisphere
      together with the left inferior frontal gyrus.

TI  - Evidence for magnocellular involvement in the identification of flanked letters.
PG  - 1881-90
AB  - Little is known about the role of the magno system in reading. One important
      hypothesis is that this system is involved in the allocation of attention. We
      reasoned that the presentation of a single letter automatically draws attention
      to this letter, whereas in the case of a flanked letter, an additional process of
      attention allocation is required for identification to occur. In three
      letter-naming experiments with 24 subjects each, normally reading adults were
      presented with flanked (e.g. xax) and with single (e.g. a) letters at three
      possible (para)foveal locations. The letters appeared in magno-disadvantageous
      colour contrast or in parvo-disadvantageous weak luminance contrast with the
      background. A control experiment verified that colour contrast had generated less
      magnocellular activity than had luminance contrast. Colour-contrast presentation 
      led to a significantly lower naming performance for flanked letters than did
      luminance-contrast presentation, despite the fact that the two contrasts did not 
      elicit differences in naming performance when the letters were presented in
      isolation. This latter finding rules out the possibility that colour contrast had
      generated not only less magno- but also less parvocellular activity than had
      luminance contrast. Thus, it can be concluded that the magno system is involved
      in the identification of flanked letters. This conclusion supports the hypothesis
      that the magno system is important to the allocation of attention. Further, it
      may provide an explanation for the frequent finding that people with
      developmental dyslexia have impairments in their magnocellular system.

TI  - A callosal transfer deficit in children with developmental language disorder.
PG  - 1541-6
AB  - Twenty-two control children (aged 6-12 years) and forty-three children with
      developmental language disorder (DLD) (aged 7-12 years) received a test of
      callosal transfer of tactile information. Among the children with dysphasia, 30
      had a diagnosis of receptive dysphasia and 13 of expressive dysphasia. Both
      control children and children with DLD made a significantly larger number of
      errors in the crossed localization condition (implying callosal transfer of
      tactile information) versus the uncrossed localization condition. In the crossed 
      localization condition, children with DLD made a significantly larger number of
      errors than controls, while no differences were found in the two groups of
      children with DLD. These data suggest that the corpus callosum may be involved in
      the pathogenesis of DLD.

TI  - Cerebellar morphology in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1285-92
AB  - Recent evidence has suggested cerebellar anomalies in developmental dyslexia.
      Therefore, we investigated cerebellar morphology in subjects with documented
      reading disabilities. We obtained T1-weighted magnetic resonance images in the
      coronal and sagittal planes from 11 males with prior histories of developmental
      dyslexia, and nine similarly-aged male controls. Proton magnetic resonance
      spectra (TE=136ms, TR=2.4s) were obtained bilaterally in the cerebellum.
      Phonological decoding skill was measured using non-word reading. Handedness was
      assessed using both the Annett questionnaire of hand preference and Annett's peg 
      moving task. Cerebellar symmetry was observed in the dyslexics but there was
      significant asymmetry (right grey matter>left grey matter) in controls. The
      interpretation of these results depended whether a motor- or questionnaire-based 
      method was used to determine handedness. The degree of cerebellar symmetry was
      correlated with the severity of dyslexics' phonological decoding deficit. Those
      with more symmetric cerebella made more errors on a nonsense word reading measure
      of phonological decoding ability. Left cerebellar metabolite ratios were shown to
      correlate significantly with the degree of cerebellar asymmetry (P<0.05) in
      controls. This relationship was absent in developmental dyslexics. Cerebellar
      morphology reflects the higher degree of symmetry found previously in the
      temporal and parietal cortex of dyslexics. The relationship of cerebellar
      asymmetry to phonological decoding ability and handedness, together with our
      previous finding of altered metabolite ratios in the cerebellum of dyslexics,
      lead us to suggest that there are alterations in the neurological organisation of
      the cerebellum which relate to phonological decoding skills, in addition to motor
      skills and handedness.

TI  - Less developed corpus callosum in dyslexic subjects--a structural MRI study.
PG  - 1035-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on previous studies and due to the characteristics of dyslexia 
      as an auditory phonological decoding disorder, we predicted that the shape of the
      posterior corpus callosum (CC) would differ between dyslexic and control
      subjects. METHOD: Twenty right-handed boys with developmental dyslexia were
      selected from a carefully screened general population sample (mean age 11 years) 
      and compared to a matched control group. The CC contour was manually traced on
      the aligned midsagittal MR slice and total callosal area and its subregions were 
      compared between the groups. A statistical shape analysis and subsequent CC
      classification was performed using a recently developed shape model method.
      RESULTS: The shape analysis revealed shorter CC shape in the dyslexic group,
      localised in the posterior midbody/isthmus region. This region contains
      interhemispheric fibers from primary and secondary auditory cortices. A shape
      length difference larger than a fixed threshold in the posterior midbody region
      could correctly discriminate between control and dyslexic subject in 78% of the
      cases, where a dyslexic CC was shorter in this region than a control CC. However,
      there were no significant group differences with respect to overall CC area or
      subregions. CONCLUSION: A clear shape difference in the posterior midbody of the 
      CC was found between dyslexic and control subjects. This fits with recent other
      studies that have reported a strong growth factor in this CC region during the
      late childhood years, coinciding with literacy acquisition. Our results show that
      the dyslexic group has not undergone the same growth pattern as the normal
      reading group.

PG  - 483-98
AB  - VLBW infants are at risk of lesions including intraventricular haemorrhage and
      periventricular leucomalacia. Those with normal IQ still present with reading
      difficulties. Oculomotor performance was assessed on 14 VLBWs (IQ > 85) and 15
      full-term age-matched controls. Anti-saccade errors were significantly higher for
      the VLBWs (78%) compared to full terms (62%) (P = 0.02). Smooth pursuit latency
      was longer for the VLBWs compared to the full terms. Greater anti-saccade errors 
      may be indicative of a lesion affecting the frontal cortex or developmental
      delay. Oculomotor deficits in VLBW children may be associated with the higher
      incidence of reading difficulties that have been reported.

TI  - A family with a grand-maternally derived interstitial duplication of proximal
      15q.
PG  - 421-30
AB  - About 1% of individuals with autism or types of pervasive developmental disorder 
      have a duplication of the 15q11-q13 region. These abnormalities can be detected
      by routine G-banded chromosome study, showing an extra marker chromosome, or
      demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, revealing an 
      interstitial duplication. We report here the molecular, cytogenetic, clinical and
      neuropsychiatric evaluations of a family in whom 3 of 4 siblings inherited an
      interstitial duplication of 15q11-q13. This duplication was inherited from their 
      mother who also had a maternally derived duplication. Affected family members had
      apraxia of speech, phonological awareness deficits, developmental language
      disorder, dyslexia, as well as limb apraxia but did not have any dysmorphic
      clinical features. The observations in this family suggest that the phenotypic
      manifestations of proximal 15q duplications may also involve language-based
      learning disabilities.

TI  - Parent and teacher report of pragmatic aspects of communication: use of the
      children's communication checklist in a clinical setting.
PG  - 809-18
AB  - The Children's Communication Checklist (CCC) was developed to provide an
      objective assessment of pragmatic aspects of children's communication
      difficulties. We aimed to (1) see whether the checklist provided valid and
      reliable information when completed by parents, and (2) consider its usefulness
      in a clinical context. Checklists were completed by parents and a professional
      who knew the child well for all 5 to 17-year-old referrals to a tertiary
      developmental paediatrics centre over a 31-month period. Children who were not
      yet speaking in sentences were excluded. From a sample of 151 children (81% male;
      mean age 8.7 years) with pervasive or specific developmental disorders, valid
      checklists were completed by 119 parents and 93 professionals. Reliability, as
      measured by internal consistency, was 0.7 or higher for most scales. Correlations
      between ratings for parents and professionals were in the range of 0.30 to 0.58
      for individual pragmatic scales, with a correlation of 0.46 (n=82) for the
      pragmatic composite. For both parents and professionals, the pragmatic composite 
      was lowest for children with a diagnosis of autism; intermediate for those with a
      diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise
      specified or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and highest for
      those with a diagnosis of specific learning disability. The strongest relation
      between the pragmatic composite and diagnosis was seen when ratings from parents 
      and professionals were combined. Differences between diagnostic groups were not
      explicable in terms of age or verbal IQ.

TI  - Neurobiological studies of reading and reading disability.
PG  - 479-92
AB  - Evidence from neuroimaging studies, including our own, suggest that skilled word 
      identification in reading is related to the functional integrity of two
      consolidated left hemisphere (LH) posterior systems: a dorsal (temporo-parietal) 
      circuit and a ventral (occipito-temporal) circuit. This posterior system appears 
      to be functionally disrupted in developmental dyslexia. Relative to nonimpaired
      readers, reading-disabled individuals demonstrate heightened reliance on both
      inferior frontal and right hemisphere posterior regions, presumably in
      compensation for the LH posterior difficulties. We propose a neurobiological
      account suggesting that for normally developing readers, the dorsal circuit
      predominates at first, and in conjunction with premotor systems, is associated
      with analytic processing necessary for learning to integrate orthographic with
      phonological and lexical semantic features of printed words. The ventral circuit 
      constitutes a fast, late-developing, word form system, which underlies fluency in
      word recognition. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, (1) the
      participant will learn about a model of lexical processing involving specific
      cortical regions. (2) The participant will learn about evidence which supports
      the theory that two dorsal LH systems may be disrupted in developmental dyslexia.
      (3) The participant will learn that individuals with reading impairment may rely 
      on other regions of the brain to compensate for the disruption of posterior
      function.

TI  - The term comorbidity is of questionable value in reference to developmental
      disorders: data and theory.
PG  - 555-65
AB  - Over the last decade, there has been an enormous increase in the number of
      studies evaluating the overlap of developmental syndromes or disorders in both
      children and adults. This overlap of symptoms is often referred to as
      comorbidity, a term we criticize in this article because of its unsubstantiated
      presumption of independent etiologies. The premise of this article is that
      discrete categories do not exist in real life, and that it is misleading to refer
      to overlapping categories or symptoms as "comorbidities." We illustrate our point
      by presenting data from 179 school-age children evaluated with rigorous research 
      criteria for seven disorders: reading disability (RD),
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental coordination
      disorder (DCD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD),
      depression, and anxiety. Fully 50% of this sample met the criteria for at least
      two diagnoses. The children with ADHD were at higher risk of having at least a
      second disorder compared to the children with RD. Overall, the high rates of
      overlap of these behavioral, emotional, and educational deficits in this broadly 
      ascertained sample support the idea that the concept of comorbidity is
      inadequate. We discuss the concept of atypical brain development as an
      explanatory idea to interpret the high rate of overlap of developmental
      disorders.

TI  - Genotype-environment correlations for language-related abilities: implications
      for typical and atypical learners.
PG  - 492-502
AB  - Recent behavioral genetic research has shown that genetic propensities are
      associated with individual differences in experiences, and thus, what may appear 
      to be environmental effects can reflect genetic influence. This study examines
      passive genotype-environment correlations (GECs) for language-related abilities
      by comparing environment-child language associations in adoptive and nonadoptive 
      families. The results provide evidence for the genetic mediation of the
      association between home environmental variables, such as the provision of toys
      and games, maternal involvement, and degree of intellectual/cultural orientation 
      with children's language-related abilities. Developmental changes in passive GECs
      are considered, and the implications for typical and atypical learners are
      discussed.

TI  - How psychological science informs the teaching of reading.
PG  - 31-74
AB  - This monograph discusses research, theory, and practice relevant to how children 
      learn to read English. After an initial overview of writing systems, the
      discussion summarizes research from developmental psychology on children's
      language competency when they enter school and on the nature of early reading
      development. Subsequent sections review theories of learning to read, the
      characteristics of children who do not learn to read (i.e., who have
      developmental dyslexia), research from cognitive psychology and cognitive
      neuroscience on skilled reading, and connectionist models of learning to read.
      The implications of the research findings for learning to read and teaching
      reading are discussed. Next, the primary methods used to teach reading (phonics
      and whole language) are summarized. The final section reviews laboratory and
      classroom studies on teaching reading. From these different sources of evidence, 
      two inescapable conclusions emerge: (a) Mastering the alphabetic principle (that 
      written symbols are associated with phonemes) is essential to becoming proficient
      in the skill of reading, and (b) methods that teach this principle directly are
      more effective than those that do not (especially for children who are at risk in
      some way for having difficulty learning to read). Using whole-language activities
      to supplement phonics instruction does help make reading fun and meaningful for
      children, but ultimately, phonics instruction is critically important because it 
      helps beginning readers understand the alphabetic principle and learn new words. 
      Thus, elementary-school teachers who make the alphabetic principle explicit are
      most effective in helping their students become skilled, independent readers.

TI  - Outstanding questions about phonological processing in dyslexia.
PG  - 197-216
AB  - It is widely accepted that developmental dyslexia results from some sort of
      phonological deficit. Yet, it can be argued that phonological representations and
      their processing have been insufficiently tested in dyslexia research. Firstly,
      claims about how tasks tap into certain kinds of representations or processes are
      best appreciated in the light of an explicit information-processing model. Here, 
      a cognitive model of lexical access is described, incorporating speech
      perception, reading and object recognition. The model emphasizes that
      phonological forms of lexical items are distinct from non-lexical phonological
      representations. Secondly, phonology, as a linguistic discipline, teaches us that
      there is much more to it than phonemic categorization and awareness. The
      phonological level of representation also embodies phonotactic regularities,
      patterns of phoneme assimilation and alternation, as well as supra-segmental
      knowledge pertaining to syllable structure, stress, intonation and rhythm. All
      these aspects are in part language-dependent, and therefore must be learnt by
      children in order to become proficient native speakers and listeners. If
      phonological representations were affected in dyslexia, dyslexic children would
      presumably have difficulties acquiring these aspects of their language. This
      prediction is as yet untested. A possible research agenda is outlined, aiming to 
      provide a more comprehensive assessment of the phonological theory of dyslexia.

TI  - Psychiatric genetics: recent advances and clinical implications.
PG  - 253-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present an overview on current progress and future directions in
      psychiatric genetics. METHODS: The review of studies that have demonstrated a
      genetic contribution to a wide range of psychopathology using family, twin,
      adoption studies and exploration of the methods and limitations of molecular
      genetic studies. RESULTS: Single gene disorders has been the area that is most
      straightforward with striking advances in disorders such as Huntington Disease
      and early onset familial Alzheimer disease. Complex phenotypes such as
      schizophrenia and affective disorder have presented greater difficulties but late
      onset Alzheimer disease and dyslexia are examples where replicated molecular
      genetic findings suggest that gene identification is feasible even for
      multifactorial disorders. CONCLUSION: The combination of increasingly complete
      information on the genome together with accessibility to this on the internet
      provide the essential tools for the search for susceptibility genes. Another
      essential requirement in trying to identify genes of small effect is well
      characterized large scale collections of cases and this demands the interaction
      of epidemiological and clinical researchers. Advances in genomics will also allow
      tailoring of pharmaceuticals pointing at treatment response and side effects.
      Hopefully all this perspectives together, will improve our understanding of the
      neurobiological pathogenesis of diseases such as Schizophrenia, Depression and
      Bipolar disorder 'legitimizing' them in the public view.

TI  - A dominant gene for developmental dyslexia on chromosome 3.
PG  - 658-64
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a neurofunctional disorder characterised by an
      unexpected difficulty in learning to read and write despite adequate
      intelligence, motivation, and education. Previous studies have suggested mostly
      quantitative susceptibility loci for dyslexia on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, and 15, but
      no genes have been identified yet. We studied a large pedigree, ascertained from 
      140 families considered, segregating pronounced dyslexia in an autosomal dominant
      fashion. Affected status and the subtype of dyslexia were determined by
      neuropsychological tests. A genome scan with 320 markers showed a novel dominant 
      locus linked to dyslexia in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 3 with a
      multipoint lod score of 3.84. Nineteen out of 21 affected pedigree members shared
      this region identical by descent (corrected p<0.001). Previously implicated
      genomic regions showed no evidence for linkage. Sequencing of two positional
      candidate genes, 5HT1F and DRD3, did not support their role in dyslexia. The new 
      locus on chromosome 3 is associated with deficits in all three essential
      components involved in the reading process, namely phonological awareness, rapid 
      naming, and verbal short term memory.

TI  - [Assessment of the Dichotic Listening Test by Feldmann in children with
      developmental reading and spelling disorders].
PG  - 610-6
AB  - In Germany the dD by Feldmann is a frequently used test in child assessment.
      Unknown, however, is the validity of the dD in the assessment of children with
      specific developmental language disorders. The dD by Feldmann are pairs of
      three-syllable content words which are presented dichotically. In this controlled
      cross-sectional study 65 children took the dichotic listening test by Feldmann
      (dD). The experimental group comprised 34 children with developmental reading and
      spelling disorders. The control group comprised 31 children with normal reading
      and spelling development. Age and nonverbal IQ were matched in both groups. The
      mean age was 9.8 years (range 7 - 11 years). The dichotic listening performance
      of right and left ear was registered separately. Twenty word pairs were presented
      dichotically at a constant amplitude of 65 dB. Memorisation of word pairs was
      tested under free recall conditions. A score of 100 % can be attained, if all
      word pairs are repeated correctly. Results demonstrated that no child attained a 
      score of 100 %. As expected, the children with the developmental reading and
      spelling disorders attained significantly lower scores than the children in the
      control group (42.4 % versus 64 %). The reason for the lower results in the
      experimental group was left ear dichotic listening performance. There were no
      significant differences in right dichotic listening performance. Raw score
      overlaps occurred to some extent in both groups, but scores of 30 % or less were 
      only observed in the experimental group. Scores correlated significantly with
      age, but not with nonverbal IQ. However, dD performance significantly correlated 
      with several measures of phonological and syntactic language development as well 
      as with auditory working memory. Based on these results it is our opinion that
      performance scores of the dD by Feldmann should be interpreted cautiously until
      validation studies have been carried out.

TI  - Brain imaging in neurobehavioral disorders.
PG  - 278-87
AB  - Neuroimaging studies of neurobehavioral disorders are using new imaging
      modalities. In dyslexia, anatomic imaging studies demonstrate an abnormal
      symmetry of the planum temporale. Functional imaging supports the hypothesis that
      developmental dyslexia is frequently the result of deficits in phonologic
      processing and that normal reading requires a patent network organization of a
      number of anterior and posterior brain areas. In autism, anatomic imaging studies
      are conflicting. Functional imaging demonstrates temporal lobe abnormalities and 
      abnormal interaction between frontal and parietal brain areas. In
      attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, imaging studies suggest an abnormality 
      in the prefrontal and striatal regions. Neuroimaging studies are often
      contradictory, but trends, especially with functional imaging analysis, are
      evolving. Because neurobehavioral disorders seem to be a result of a dysfunction 
      in brain circuits, no one region will be abnormal in all patients studied.
      Further studies with well-defined patient populations and appropriate activation 
      paradigms will better elucidate the pathophysiology of these conditions.

TI  - Language representation in a patient with a dominant right hemisphere: fMRI
      evidence for an intrahemispheric reorganisation.
PG  - 2785-90
AB  - Studies have suggested that congenital left hemispheric (LH) frontal
      arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are associated with an early transfer of
      language to right hemisphere (RH) frontal regions. The question remains whether
      such anatomofunctional reorganisation is due to RH compensatory abilities or to a
      general principle of lateral shift. In this study, we used fMRI language
      paradigms to investigate the case of a patient presenting aphasic symptoms
      following an haemorrhage due to a right frontal AVM. Prior to surgery, fMRI
      showed that language processing was confined to the RH, suggesting that language 
      had not shifted during childhood from this congenitally dominant RH to the LH.
      After surgery, the patient presented severe aphasia that recovered to presurgical
      level within 70 days. At this time, fMRI showed that language tasks were still
      not associated with activations in the LH. These results suggest that the
      principles of early cerebral reorganisation after congenital lesions may differ
      in the RH and the LH. In addition, they support the idea that efficient
      restoration of language is achieved if a sufficiently large neuronal network is
      preserved around the lesion.

TI  - [Developmental dyslexia: contribution of modern neuropsychology].
PG  - 847-53
AB  - In France about 1 million children are thought to present learning disabilities
      for reading that in most cases correspond to developmental dyslexias. These are
      specific and constitutional deficits that prevent rapid and automatic reading
      abilities from developing, in spite of a normal intelligence and normal visual
      and auditory acuity. The most frequent form of dyslexia is called "phonological
      dyslexia" as it results from a deficit of perception and manipulation of phonemes
      (i.e. "phonological awareness"). Functional neuro-imaging has great potential for
      helping understand such functional deficits that are likely to be caused by
      microscopic abnormalities such as micro-polygyria localised in the perisylvian
      cortex. Tomographic methods have shown deficits of activation of these cortical
      areas. Electrophysiological methods revealed abnormalities of various events such
      as MMN or N400, and more recently, delayed latencies of earlier markers
      suggesting deficits of encoding short-lived features of speech signal.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: the cerebellar deficit hypothesis.
PG  - 508-11
AB  - Surprisingly, the problems faced by many dyslexic children are by no means
      confined to reading and spelling. There appears to be a general impairment in the
      ability to perform skills automatically, an ability thought to be dependent upon 
      the cerebellum. Specific behavioural and neuroimaging tests reviewed here
      indicate that dyslexia is indeed associated with cerebellar impairment in about
      80% of cases. We propose that disorders of cerebellar development can in fact
      cause the impairments in reading and writing characteristic of dyslexia, a view
      consistent with the recently appreciated role of the cerebellum in
      language-related skills. This proposal has implications for early remedial
      treatment.

TI  - Approaches to gene mapping in complex disorders and their application in child
      psychiatry and psychology.
PG  - 122-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twin studies demonstrate the importance of genes and environment in
      the aetiology of childhood psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Advances
      in molecular genetics enable the identification of genes involved in complex
      disorders and enable the study of molecular mechanisms and gene--environment
      interactions. AIMS: To review the role of molecular genetics studies in childhood
      behavioural and developmental traits. METHOD: Molecular approaches to complex
      disorders are reviewed, with examples from autism, reading disability and
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). RESULTS: The most robust finding
      in ADHD is the association of a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism in
      exon 3 of the DRD4 gene. Other replicated associations with ADHD are outlined in 
      the text. In autism, there is a replicated linkage finding on chromosome 7.
      Linkage studies in reading disability have confirmed a locus on chromosome 6 and 
      strongly suggest one on chromosome 15. CONCLUSIONS: In the next 5--0 years
      susceptibility genes for these disorders will be established. Describing their
      relationship to biological and behavioural function will be a far greater
      challenge.

TI  - Cross-modality temporal processing deficits in developmental phonological
      dyslexics.
PG  - 319-25
AB  - Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that poor readers may have abnormal lateral
      (LGN) and medial (MGN) geniculate nuclei responsible for temporal processing in
      visual and auditory domains respectively (Livingstone & Galaburda, 1993).
      Although behavioral evidence does support this neuroanatomical evidence in that
      poor readers have performed poorly on visual and auditory tasks thought to
      require the utilization of the LGN and MGN, respectively, appropriate examination
      of the coexistence of these behavioral abnormalities in the same population of
      poor readers has yet to take place. The present study examined correlations
      between visual and auditory temporal processing scores of all readers (collapsed 
      groups), good readers, and poor readers who were isolated into phonological and
      surface dyslexic subtypes. The same subjects and data from Cestnick and Coltheart
      (1999) and Cestnick and Jerger (2000) were used to run the analyses. Results
      demonstrated a multitude of correlations between these tasks for the phonological
      dyslexic group only. It is contended that cross-modality temporal processing
      deficits may exist in poor nonlexical (phonological dyslexics) as opposed to poor
      lexical (surface dyslexics) readers. It is conceivable that phonological
      dyslexics may also have deficiencies within the LGN and MGN, or perhaps within
      systems related to these nuclei. The precise cause of these processing patterns
      and correlations is still unknown.

TI  - From "logographic" to normal reading: the case of a deaf beginning reader.
PG  - 212-23
AB  - Visual word recognition of a profoundly deaf girl (AH) with developmental reading
      disorders was explored using an experimental technique that measures performance 
      as a function of eye fixation within a word. AH's fixation-dependent word
      recognition profile revealed that she was inferring the identity of words using a
      "logographic" reading strategy (i. e., using salient visual features). Following 
      this observation a special training program that enhances the understanding of
      grapheme-phoneme relations was applied. After few months of training, AH's
      reading skills improved, while her fixation-dependent performance changed to
      become like that of normal readers. We discuss the impact of our technique for
      the early diagnosis of reading impairments.

      disorder].
PG  - 167-77
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present article provides an overview of the main approaches in the
      current literature on the neurobiological correlates of developmental dyslexia.
      METHODS: Approximately 120 articles, published mainly within the past six years, 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: Three topics are of focal interest: first, the point of
      unusual asymmetries of the temporal plana and deviations of the corpus callosum; 
      second, the analysis of abnormal patterns of activation of the left hemispherical
      frontal and temporal lobes. In this context, a dysfunction of the angular gyrus
      is discussed. The third approach postulates that global deficits of subcortical
      systems concerning the temporal procession of acoustic and visual information
      play a major role in the cause of dyslexia. CONCLUSIONS: The first approach is
      not specific enough with regard to negative results, whereas the second and third
      seem particularly promising.

TI  - Impaired temporal contrast sensitivity in dyslexics is specific to
      retain-and-compare paradigms.
PG  - 1381-95
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a specific reading disability that affects 5-10% of the
      population. Recent studies have suggested that dyslexics may experience a deficit
      in the visual magnocellular pathway. The most extensively studied prediction
      deriving from this hypothesis is impaired contrast sensitivity to transient,
      low-luminance stimuli at low spatial frequencies. However, the findings are
      inconsistent across studies and even seemingly contradictory. In the present
      study, we administered several different paradigms for assessing temporal
      contrast sensitivity, and found both impaired and normal contrast sensitivity
      within the same group of dyslexic participants. Under sequential presentation, in
      a temporal forced choice paradigm, dyslexics showed impaired sensitivity to both 
      drifting and flickering gratings. However, under simultaneous presentation, with 
      a spatial forced choice paradigm, dyslexics' sensitivity did not differ from that
      of the controls. Within each paradigm, dyslexics' sensitivity was poorer at
      higher temporal frequencies, consistent with the magnocellular hypothesis. These 
      results suggest that a basic perceptual impairment in dyslexics may be their
      limited ability to retain-and-compare perceptual traces across brief intervals.

      disabilities?
PG  - 125-49
AB  - The double-deficit hypothesis (Wolf, M. and Bowers, P.G. (1999) The
      double-deficit hypothesis for the developmental dyslexias. Journal of Educational
      Psychology, 91, 415-438) proposes that deficits in phonological processing and
      rapid automatized naming (RAN) are separable sources of reading dysfunction.
      Further, the double-deficit hypothesis predicts that the presence of deficits in 
      both phonological processing and RAN have an additive negative influence on
      reading performance above and beyond that of a single deficit. The purpose of
      this study was to examine the additive nature of phonological awareness (PA)- and
      RAN-deficits on written language skill in children with reading disabilities
      (RD). Concurrent relationships between PA, RAN, and written language skills were 
      examined in 476 children with RD, ranging in age from 8 to 18 years of age.
      Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that PA and RAN skill have an additive 
      effect on a majority of the reading and spelling measures. When participants were
      classified into three deficit subtypes based on the double-deficit model (i.e.
      phonological-, rate-, and double-deficit), comparisons across the subtypes
      confirmed that individuals with double-deficits performed below the
      single-deficit groups on both subtyping variables (RAN and PA) and all measures
      of written language. When the double- and single-deficit groups were matched on
      the subtyping variable (i.e. double- and rate-deficit groups matched on RAN and
      double- and phonological-deficit groups matched on PA) differences between the
      double- and rate-deficit groups remained in non-word reading, whereas differences
      between the double- and phonological-deficit groups remained in timed word
      recognition and reading comprehension. These results support an additive model in
      which RAN-deficits primarily affect tasks that require speeded/fluent response,
      and PA-deficits primarily affect tasks that emphasize phonological processing
      skill. Results are also presented that illustrate several statistical problems
      associated with the formation of deficit groups by dichotomizing the RAN and PA
      variables.

TI  - Visual evoked potential abnormalities in dyslexic children.
PG  - 219-29
AB  - Developmental reading disability (dyslexia) has traditionally been attributed to 
      impaired linguistic skills. Recent psychophysical data suggest that dyslexia may 
      be related to a visual perceptual deficit. A few visual evoked potential (VEP)
      studies have addressed this hypothesis, but their results are far from
      consistent. We submitted 9 dyslexic subjects and 9 age- and sex-matched normal
      controls to checkerboard pattern reversal VEPs. The main experimental variables
      were: large (0.5 cycles per degree; cpd) and small (2 cpd) checks and two
      reversal frequencies (2.1 Hz and 8 Hz); mean luminance and contrast (60 cd/m2 and
      50%, respectively) were kept constant in all four conditions. Transient VEP (2.1 
      Hz) parameters did not differ between controls and dyslexics at 2 cpd. At 0.5
      cpd, N70 amplitude was significantly smaller and N70 latency significantly
      shorter in dyslexics. Amplitudes for the fundamental frequency (8 Hz), as well as
      for the second and third harmonics of the steady-state VEPs were smaller in
      dyslexics for both stimulus sizes. A discriminant analysis correctly classified
      each subject. Our data confirm the hypothesis of a perceptual deficit in dyslexic
      subjects. The abnormalities are related to spatial and temporal stimulus
      frequencies: they appear when large stimuli are presented, or when the
      stimulation frequency is high. These data support the hypothesis of selective
      magnocellular dysfunction in dyslexia.

TI  - Attention deficity/hyperactivity in SLI children increases risk of
      speech/language disorders in first-degree relatives: a preliminary report.
PG  - 339-54
AB  - Specific language impairment (SLI) or developmental dysphasia denotes the
      inability to acquire normal expression and/or comprehension of language in the
      absence of peripheral hearing impairment, neurological disorder, and mental
      retardation. The presence of attention deficit/hyperactivity in some SLI children
      has previously been documented. This family history study used 27 SLI families,
      identified through the parents from the Dysphasia Association, to examine the
      relationship between attention deficit/hyperactivity in SLI children and the risk
      to first-degree relatives. All SLI children were clinically diagnosed with
      speech/language disorder; medical records were searched for the presence of any
      of the exclusion criteria noted above. The 13 SLI children with medical record of
      attention deficit/hyperactivity had a significantly higher chance of having
      first-degree relatives with speech/language disorders than 14 SLI children
      without such record (15/27 and 4/46, respectively). This preliminary report
      suggests that additional study is warranted to investigate the relationship
      between speech/language disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity in families
      of SLI children. LEARNING OUTCOMES: As a result of this activity, the participant
      will be able to describe the SLI phenotype, its prevalence, and complexity and to
      recognize the relationship between comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity in
      SLI children and the risk of speech/language disorder in their relatives.

TI  - All developmental dyslexic subtypes display an elevated motion coherence
      threshold.
PG  - 510-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Psychophysical studies indicate that many dyslexics have a
      motion-processing deficit. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
      elevated motion coherence thresholds correlate with the specific dyslexic
      subtypes as defined by the Boder classification scheme. METHODS: Twenty-one
      dyslexics (seven dyseidetics, six dysphonetics, and eight dysphoneidetics) and 19
      age- and gender-matched controls participated in the study. The dyslexics were
      identified by an exclusionary approach and then subtyped with the Adult Dyslexia 
      Test or the Dyslexia Determination Test. Motion coherence thresholds were
      determined with random dot kinematograms composed of signal dots and noise dots. 
      Signal dots moved either left or right on each trial, whereas noise dots moved in
      random directions. The percentage of dots that comprised the signal was varied
      randomly on each trial (0 to 21% in 3% increments). Subjects guessed the
      direction of signal dot motion on each trial (two-alternative forced-choice
      task). A 75% correct threshold was determined with a Weibull equation fit to the 
      psychometric function. RESULTS: All three dyslexic subtypes had elevated motion
      coherence thresholds (t-test; dyseidetics p = 0.01, dysphonetics p = 0.039,
      dysphoneidetics p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Motion-coherence deficits are not
      correlated with a specific dyslexic subtype, but, rather, are common to all
      subtypes. However, some individuals in each of the dyslexic subtypes were found
      to have normal motion coherence thresholds, suggesting that other factors must be
      considered to predict the motion sensitivity deficits found in dyslexia.

TI  - Perceiving imitatible stimuli: consequences of isomorphism between input and
      output.
PG  - 543-53
AB  - For more than a century, psychologists have been intrigued by the idea that
      mental representations of perceived human actions are closely connected with
      mental representations of performing those same actions. In this article,
      connections between input and output representations are considered in terms of
      the potential for imitation. A broad range of evidence suggests that, for
      imitatible stimuli, input and output representations are isomorphic to one
      another, allowing mutual influence between perception and motoric planning that
      is rapid, effortless, and possibly obligatory. Thus, the cognitive consequences
      of imitatibility may underlie such diverse phenomena as phoneme perception;
      imitation in neonates; echoic memory; stimulus-response compatibility; conduction
      aphasia; maintenance rehearsal; and a variety of developmental and social
      activities such as language acquisition, social learning, empathy, and monitoring
      one's own behavior.

TI  - The "temporal processing deficit" hypothesis in dyslexia: new experimental
      evidence.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - The notion that developmental dyslexia may result from a general, nonspecific,
      defect in perceiving rapidly changing auditory signals is a current subject of
      debate (so-called "temporal processing deficit" hypothesis). Thirteen
      phonological dyslexics (age 10-13 years) and 10 controls matched for
      chronological and reading age were compared on a temporal order judgment (TOJ)
      task using the succession of two consonants (/p/-/s/) within a cluster. In order 
      to test the relevance of the temporal deficit hypothesis, the task also included 
      two additional conditions where either the two stimuli were artificially slowed
      or the interstimulus interval was expanded. As expected, the TOJ performance was 
      significantly poorer in dyslexics than in controls. Moreover, in the "slowed
      speech" condition dyslexics' performance improved to reach the normal controls'
      level, whereas no significant improvement occurred when increasing the
      interstimulus interval. Finally dyslexics' performances, especially on the slowed
      condition, were found correlated with several tests of phonological processing
      (phoneme deletion, rhyme judgment, and nonword spelling tasks). These results
      lend support to the general temporal deficit theory of dyslexia.

TI  - Treatment of Childhood Idiopathic Language Deterioration with Valproate.
PG  - 272-276
AB  - Childhood idiopathic language deterioration is a rare condition in which children
      lose previously gained language skills. In some children this language
      deterioration occurs in association with behavioral seizures or EEG epileptiform 
      activity. The effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs in this patient population is 
      not known. Here we retrospectively reviewed records of 57 children with childhood
      idiopathic language deterioration associated with seizures or epileptiform
      activity on their EEG who received valproate for the purpose of treating their
      language impairment. In 22 of the children improvement in language skills was
      observed. In two children language returned to normal while in the other 20 the
      improvement was modest. Children who responded to valproate had an earlier age of
      onset of the aphasia than children who were nonresponders. Seizure type, EEG
      findings, developmental status, and presence or absence of a frequency-modulated 
      auditory evoked potential were not related to response. This study demonstrates
      that valproate can be helpful in improving language function in some children
      with idiopathic language deterioration associated with seizures or epileptiform
      activity on the EEG.

TI  - Approach to learning disability.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - Learning disabilities (LD) is one of the important causes of poor academic
      performance in school going children. Learning disabilities are developmental
      disorders that usually manifest during the period of normal education. These
      disabilities create a significant gap between the true potential and day to day
      performance of an individual. Dyslexia, dysgraphia and dyscalculia denote the
      problem related to reading, writing and mathematics. Perinatal problems are
      certain neurological conditions, known to be associated with LD; however, genetic
      predisposition seems to be the most probable etiological factors. Evaluation of a
      child suspected to be having LD consists of medical examination, vision and
      hearing test analysis of school performance. The psycho-behaviour assessment and 
      education testing are essential in the process of diagnosis. The experienced
      persons in the field of LD should interpret the results of such tests. With
      Individualized Remedial Education Plan (IEP) most children learn to cope up with 
      disability and may get integrated in a regular steam.

TI  - Are dyslexics' visual deficits limited to measures of dorsal stream function?
PG  - 1527-30
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that the differences in performance between
      developmental dyslexics and controls on visual tasks are specific for the
      detection of dynamic stimuli. We found that dyslexics were less sensitive than
      controls to coherent motion in dynamic random dot displays. However, their
      sensitivity to control measures of static visual form coherence was not
      significantly different from that of controls. This dissociation of dyslexics'
      performance on measures that are suggested to tap the sensitivity of different
      extrastriate visual areas provides evidence for an impairment specific to the
      detection of dynamic properties of global stimuli, perhaps resulting from
      selective deficits in dorsal stream functions.

TI  - Early reading development in children at family risk for dyslexia.
PG  - 816-33
AB  - In a 3-year longitudinal study, middle- to upper-middle-class preschool children 
      at high family risk (HR group, N = 67) and low family risk (LR group, N = 57) for
      dyslexia (or reading disability, RD), were evaluated yearly from before
      kindergarten to the end of second grade. Both phonological processing and
      literacy skills were tested at each of four time points. Consistent with the
      well-known familiarity of RD, 34% of the HR group compared with 6% of the LR
      group became RD. Participants who became RD showed deficits in both implicit and 
      explicit phonological processing skills at all four time points, clearly
      indicating a broader phonological deficit than is often found at older ages. The 
      predictors of literacy skill did not vary by risk group. Both risk groups
      underwent a similar developmental shift from letter-name knowledge to phoneme
      awareness as the main predictor of later literacy skill. This shift, however,
      occurred 2 years later in the HR group. Familial risk was continuous rather than 
      discrete because HR children who did not become RD performed worse than LR non-RD
      children on some phonological and literacy measures. Finally, later RD could be
      predicted with moderate accuracy at age 5 years, with the strongest predictor
      being letter-name knowledge.

TI  - Genetic factors contributing to learning and language delays and disabilities.
PG  - 259-77, viii
AB  - Reading disability shows substantial genetic influence, and it is in this area of
      early-onset cognitive delays that genetic research has made the most progress.
      Reading disability also provides the first success story for identifying
      replicable quantitative trait locus linkage for behavioral disorders. Language
      and communication disorders also show substantial genetic influence, as does
      general cognitive ability (intelligence), which plays a role in most cognitive
      disabilities. The genetics of reading disability, communication disorders, and
      mental retardation are reviewed. Early-onset cognitive disabilities are prime
      targets for molecular genetic studies that will eventually identify specific
      genes that can predict risk, assist diagnosis and treatment, and provide discrete
      windows through which we can investigate the development of brain mechanisms that
      lie between genes and behavior.

TI  - The prevalence of reading and spelling difficulties among inmates of institutions
      for compulsory care of juvenile delinquents.
PG  - 62-76
AB  - Recent studies have focused on reading and writing disabilities among inmates in 
      prisons and at juvenile institutions. Some studies in Sweden have demonstrated
      that more than half of the delinquents have serious reading difficulties, and for
      immigrants the situation is even worse. However, these studies have focused on
      small groups. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to different types of
      reading and writing difficulties. The main purpose of this investigation was to
      estimate the prevalence of reading and writing disabilities in juvenile
      institutions. The study analyses gender differences and differences between
      immigrants and Swedish pupils. The study included 163 pupils from 22 institutions
      and used three tests of literacy skills: word identification, spelling and
      reading comprehension. More than 70% showed some problems in reading and
      spelling. However, only 11% had serious difficulties. Moreover, the results
      showed that comprehension ability among immigrant boys was lower than among
      Swedish boys, despite the same level of word reading skill. The high prevalence
      of reading and writing disabilities seems primarily to be related to social and
      cultural factors, home backgrounds, limited school attendance and poor
      self-esteem rather than to constitutional problems of a dyslexic nature. The
      implication of this conclusion may be important for the intervention process.

PG  - 384-99
AB  - Experiments previously reported in the literature suggest that people with
      dyslexia have a deficit in categorical perception. However, it is still unclear
      whether the deficit is specific to the perception of speech sounds or whether it 
      more generally affects auditory function. In order to investigate the
      relationship between categorical perception and dyslexia, as well as the nature
      of this categorization deficit, speech specific or not, the discrimination
      responses of children who have dyslexia and those of average readers to sinewave 
      analogues of speech sounds were compared. These analogues were presented in two
      different conditions, either as nonspeech whistles or as speech sounds. Results
      showed that children with dyslexia are less categorical than average readers in
      the speech condition, mainly because they are better at discriminating acoustic
      differences between stimuli belonging to the same category. In the nonspeech
      condition, discrimination was also better for children with dyslexia, but
      differences in categorical perception were less clear-cut. Further, the location 
      of the categorical boundary on the stimulus continuum differed between speech and
      nonspeech conditions. As a whole, this study shows that categorical deficit in
      children with dyslexia results primarily from an increased perceptibility of
      within-category differences and that it has a speech-specific component. These
      findings may have profound implications for learning and re-education.

TI  - Auditory temporal processing deficit in dyslexia is associated with enhanced
      sensitivity in the visual modality.
PG  - 507-10
AB  - Developmental dyslexia has been associated with a deficit in temporal processing,
      but it is controversial whether the postulated deficit is pansensory or limited
      to the auditory modality. We present psychophysical assessment data of auditory
      and visual temporal processing abilities in children with dyslexia. While none of
      the dyslexic children displayed temporal processing abnormalities in the visual
      sensory modality, dyslexics with poor auditory temporal scores reached high-level
      visual performance. Our results do not confirm the hypothesis of a general
      temporal processing deficit for dyslexia but suggest that limitations in auditory
      temporal processing might be compensated for by a well-functioning visual sensory
      modality.

TI  - Does dyslexia develop from learning the alphabet in the wrong hemisphere? A
      cognitive neuroscience analysis.
PG  - 282-316
AB  - A new perspective is described which views developmental dyslexia as the outcome 
      of learning to write the alphabet in the nondominant (right) hemisphere. The
      letter-level and whole-word subtypes of dyslexia are seen as differing responses 
      adopted to cope with this predicament. Striking similarities between dyslexics
      and callosotomy patients in the allocation of covert attention to lateralized
      stimuli provide direction for integrating a diversity of dyslexic research within
      this framework. This synthesis, together with information from pure alexia, brain
      activation, and reading research, lends insight into the neural circuitry of the 
      compensatory strategies adopted by the two dyslexic subtypes.

TI  - Exploring the cognitive phenotype of autism: weak "central coherence" in parents 
      and siblings of children with autism: II. Real-life skills and preferences.
PG  - 309-16
AB  - Information on everyday life activities and preferences in both social and
      nonsocial domains was obtained from parents and children who had taken part in an
      experimental study of central coherence. Comparisons were made between parents
      who had a son with autism, parents with a dyslexic son, and families without a
      history of developmental disorder, as well as the male siblings in these
      families. Data on everyday preferences and abilities were elicited by means of an
      experimental questionnaire. Significant group differences in social and nonsocial
      preferences were found, suggesting that some parents showed similarities with
      their son with autism, in preference for nonsocial activities and ability in
      detail-focused processing. A similar experimental questionnaire, completed by
      parents on behalf of their sons, discriminated between autism group probands and 
      controls, but did not differentiate sibling groups. The relevance of the
      nonsocial items to central coherence is discussed in the light of the findings in
      Part I: autism parents who reported more autism-related nonsocial (but not
      social) preferences, tended to show a piecemeal processing style on the
      experimental tasks.

TI  - Boys with reading disabilities and/or ADHD: distinctions in early childhood.
PG  - 98-106
AB  - We examined distinctions in the early childhood characteristics of boys with
      reading disabilities (RD) and/or attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD). A four-group mixed design consisting of boys identified at age 11 with
      reading disabilities only (RD only; n = 46), reading disabilities and ADHD
      (RD/ADHD; n = 16), ADHD only (n = 20), and a comparison group (n = 281) was
      utilized. Differences on receptive and expressive language and temperament for
      ages 3 and 5 were investigated. Analyses indicated that the boys from the RD-only
      group performed worse on measures of receptive and expressive language. The
      results also indicated that boys from the RD/ADHD groups consistently performed
      worse on measures of receptive language and exhibited more behaviors indicative
      of an undercontrolled temperament. In summary, we suggest that reading
      disabilities and ADHD represent moderately unique disorders that frequently
      co-occur and are characterized by distinct developmental pathways.

TI  - Could platelet activating factor play a role in developmental dyslexia?
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Post-mortem studies by Galaburda and colleagues on the brains of developmental
      dyslexics found characteristic neuronal abnormalities: ectopias, microgyria, and 
      fewer large-soma cells in sensory thalamus. An association between dyslexia and
      immune dysfunction has also been proposed. We describe a mechanism which may
      explain these observations. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a
      pro-inflammatory lipid implicated in neurological disorders. We propose that PAF 
      may also be involved in dyslexia.

TI  - Disrupted neural responses to phonological and orthographic processing in
      dyslexic children: an fMRI study.
PG  - 299-307
AB  - Developmental dyslexia, characterized by difficulty in reading, has been
      associated with phonological and orthographic processing deficits. fMRI was
      performed on dyslexic and normal-reading children (8-12 years old) during
      phonological and orthographic tasks of rhyming and matching visually presented
      letter pairs. During letter rhyming, both normal and dyslexic reading children
      had activity in left frontal brain regions, whereas only normal-reading children 
      had activity in left temporo-parietal cortex. During letter matching,
      normal-reading children showed activity throughout extrastriate cortex,
      especially in occipito-parietal regions, whereas dyslexic children had little
      activity in extrastriate cortex during this task. These results indicate dyslexia
      may be characterized in childhood by disruptions in the neural bases of both
      phonological and orthographic processes important for reading.

TI  - Callosal transfer in different subtypes of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - Sixteen controls (age 6-13) and 20 native Italian children with developmental
      dyslexia (age 7-15) received a test of callosal transfer of tactile information. 
      Among the dyslexic children, 7 had a diagnosis of L-type, 7 of P-type and 6 of
      M-type dyslexia according to Bakker's classification. Both control children and
      children with dyslexia made a significantly larger number of errors in the
      crossed localization condition (implying callosal transfer of tactile
      information) vs. the uncrossed condition. In the same condition, children with
      dyslexia made a significantly larger number of errors than controls. In the
      crossed localization condition L-types and M-types made a significantly larger
      number of errors than P-types and controls, while there was no significant
      difference in performance between P-types and controls. These findings are
      discussed in terms of defective callosal transfer or deficient somatosensory
      representation in children with L- and M-dyslexia.

TI  - Language and brain: what is up? What is coming up?
PG  - 49-73
AB  - The classical aphasiological model of brain/language relationships is nowadays
      complemented by independent results from functional neuroimaging studies using
      techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography, functional Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging, or Event-Related Electro-Encephalography and Magneto-Encephalography
      mapping. Although brain mapping of language is still hampered by many
      methodological pitfalls, these methods now appear reliable and provide a renewed 
      description of the temporal spatial dynamics of neural ensembles subserving
      language functions. Moreover, neuroimaging techniques should also shed a new
      light on remaining difficult issues such as neural and functional plasticity in
      developmental or post-lesional contexts.

TI  - Linkage studies suggest a possible locus for developmental dyslexia on chromosome
      1p.
PG  - 120-9
AB  - Eight extended dyslexic families with at least four affected individuals were
      genotyped with twelve genetic markers spanning the Rh (rhesus factor) locus.
      Eleven of these markers were located on the short arm and the other was on the
      long arm of chromosome 1. Five theoretically derived phenotypes were used in the 
      linkage analyses: 1) phonemic awareness; 2) phonological decoding; 3) rapid
      automatized naming; 4) single word reading; and 5) vocabulary. In addition, a
      lifetime diagnosis of dyslexia was used as a phenotype. Both parametric and
      non-parametric genetic analyses were completed. The results supported the
      importance of a putative locus on 1p. In addition, two-locus analyses assuming
      the interaction between a 1p locus and a 6p locus, previously shown to be of
      interest for dyslexia, were conducted. As a result, the nonparametric linkage
      (NPL) scores for rapid automatized naming and phonological decoding were
      significantly increased. In particular, the NPL scores for rapid automatized
      naming exceeded 5.0 for certain markers. These results provide strong evidence
      for separate but jointly acting contributions of the 1p and 6p loci to the
      reading impairments associated with rapid naming and suggestive evidence for a
      similar mechanism involving phonological decoding.

AB  - Comparisons of the developmental pathways of the first 5 years of life for
      children with (N = 107) and without (N = 93) familial risk for dyslexia observed 
      in the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal study of Dyslexia are reviewed. The earliest
      differences between groups were found at the ages of a few days and at 6 months
      in brain event-related potential responses to speech sounds and in head-turn
      responses (at 6 months), conditioned to reflect categorical perception of speech 
      stimuli. The development of vocalization and motor behavior, based on parental
      report of the time of reaching significant milestones, or the growth of
      vocabulary (using the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories) failed to 
      reveal differences before age 2. Similarly, no group differences were found in
      cognitive and language development assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development and the Reynell Developmental Language Scales before age 2.5. The
      earliest language measure that showed lower scores among the at-risk group was
      maximum sentence length at age 2. Early gross motor development had higher
      correlation to later language skills among the at-risk group rather than the
      control children. The most consistent predictor of differential development
      between groups was the onset of talking. Children who were identified as late
      talkers at age 2 were still delayed at the age 3.5 in most features of
      language-related skills-but only if they belonged to the group at familial risk
      for dyslexia. Several phonological and naming measures known to correlate with
      reading from preschool age differentiated the groups consistently from age 3.5.
      Our findings imply that a marked proportion of children at familial risk for
      dyslexia follow atypical neurodevelopmental paths. The signs listed previously
      comprise a pool of candidates for early predictors and precursors of dyslexia,
      which await validation.

TI  - The magnocellular theory of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 12-36
AB  - Low literacy is termed 'developmental dyslexia' when reading is significantly
      behind that expected from the intelligence quotient (IQ) in the presence of other
      symptoms--incoordination, left-right confusions, poor sequencing--that
      characterize it as a neurological syndrome. 5-10% of children, particularly boys,
      are found to be dyslexic. Reading requires the acquisition of good orthographic
      skills for recognising the visual form of words which allows one to access their 
      meaning directly. It also requires the development of good phonological skills
      for sounding out unfamiliar words using knowledge of letter sound conversion
      rules. In the dyslexic brain, temporoparietal language areas on the two sides are
      symmetrical without the normal left-sided advantage. Also brain 'warts'
      (ectopias) are found, particularly clustered round the left temporoparietal
      language areas. The visual magnocellular system is responsible for timing visual 
      events when reading. It therefore signals any visual motion that occurs if
      unintended movements lead to images moving off the fovea ('retinal slip'). These 
      signals are then used to bring the eyes back on target. Thus, sensitivity to
      visual motion seems to help determine how well orthographic skill can develop in 
      both good and bad readers. In dyslexics, the development of the visual
      magnocellular system is impaired: development of the magnocellular layers of the 
      dyslexic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is abnormal; their motion sensitivity
      is reduced; many dyslexics show unsteady binocular fixation; hence poor visual
      localization, particularly on the left side (left neglect). Dyslexics' binocular 
      instability and visual perceptual instability, therefore, can cause the letters
      they are trying to read to appear to move around and cross over each other.
      Hence, blanking one eye (monocular occlusion) can improve reading. Thus, good
      magnocellular function is essential for high motion sensitivity and stable
      binocular fixation, hence proper development of orthographic skills. Many
      dyslexics also have auditory/phonological problems. Distinguishing letter sounds 
      depends on picking up the changes in sound frequency and amplitude that
      characterize them. Thus, high frequency (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM)
      sensitivity helps the development of good phonological skill, and low sensitivity
      impedes the acquisition of these skills. Thus dyslexics' sensitivity to FM and AM
      is significantly lower than that of good readers and this explains their problems
      with phonology. The cerebellum is the head ganglion of magnocellular systems; it 
      contributes to binocular fixation and to inner speech for sounding out words, and
      it is clearly defective in dyslexics. Thus, there is evidence that most reading
      problems have a fundamental sensorimotor cause. But why do magnocellular systems 
      fail to develop properly? There is a clear genetic basis for impaired development
      of magnocells throughout the brain. The best understood linkage is to the region 
      of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class 1 on the short arm of
      chromosome 6 which helps to control the production of antibodies. The development
      of magnocells may be impaired by autoantibodies affecting the developing brain.
      Magnocells also need high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids to preserve the 
      membrane flexibility that permits the rapid conformational changes of channel
      proteins which underlie their transient sensitivity. But the genes that underlie 
      magnocellular weakness would not be so common unless there were compensating
      advantages to dyslexia. In developmental dyslexics there may be heightened
      development of parvocellular systems that underlie their holistic, artistic,
      'seeing the whole picture' and entrepreneurial talents.

TI  - Arithmetic skills in kindergarten children with developmental language disorders.
PG  - 71-7
AB  - Although arithmetic is not a language-based skill, a specific learning disability
      in arithmetic--dyscalculia--is commonly seen in children with developmental
      language disorders (DLD). The object of this study was to assess whether
      kindergarten children with DLD have impaired arithmetic skills and, if so, to
      correlate the pattern of dysfunction with language syndromes. Forty-two children 
      with DLD attending mainstream kindergartens, and their matched controls,
      underwent an arithmetic battery, neurological examination, intelligence quotient 
      (IQ) test (WPPSI/WISC-R) and language assessment (CELF-R).* Attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was diagnosed by psychological assessment and
      behaviour questionnaires. Results showed that children with DLD were similar to
      controls on performance IQ (104.2+/-12.1 and 109.4+/-12.7 respectively, p = NS), 
      but inferior on both the CELF-R expressive (74.8+/-9.3 vs 95.2+/-15.1, p < 0.01) 
      and receptive (77.5+/-10.0 vs 87.8+/-12.3, p < 0.01) language scores. Their
      performance on the arithmetic battery was also significantly poorer: 61.2+/-17.7 
      vs 77.4+/-13.7, p < 0.01. Low scores in reasoning principles and arithmetic
      operations were associated with both receptive and expressive language
      impairment, while poor performance on counting principles was primarily
      associated with expressive deficits. Mild motor signs and ADHD were more frequent
      in children with DLD (p < 0.01 and < 0.05, respectively). We concluded that the
      arithmetic impairment in children with DLD is pervasive, affecting a broad
      spectrum of skills. Whereas impairment of most arithmetic skills is associated
      with global language disturbances, counting correlates primarily with expressive 
      language deficits. Anticipatory guidance by physicians will better prepare
      parents and educators for the multiple challenges facing children with DLD.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: an update on genes, brains, and environments.
PG  - 91-125
AB  - The science of reading and developmental dyslexia has experienced spectacular
      advances during the last few years. Five aspects of this research are discussed
      in the article. (1) The holistic phenomenon of reading is complex. Many
      lower-level psychological processes (e.g., phonemic awareness, phonological
      decoding, ability to process stimuli rapidly and automatize this process, memory,
      ability to recognize words) contribute to a single act of reading.
      Conceptualizing the complex process of reading through its partly overlapping but
      partly independent components--which contribute to, but do not fully explain, the
      holistic process of reading--provides an excellent model for understanding
      complex hierarchies of higher mental functions. Those who master reading skills
      successfully and those who have difficulties doing so differ in a wide range of
      reading-related processes. The central deficit experienced by poor readers
      appears to be related to phonological processing (a complex hierarchy of
      functions related to processing phonemes), whereas characteristics of
      automatization processes seem to moderate the reading outcome for people whose
      phonological skills are weak. (2) There are new data addressing models of
      dyslexia in languages other than English. The most fascinating finding is that
      the model implicating phonological deficit as central to dyslexia, and the lack
      of ability to automatize as leading to troubled reading, appears to be universal,
      regardless of the specific language. However, there is an interaction effect
      between the characteristics of a particular language and the developmental model 
      of dyslexia. In phonologically more difficult languages (e.g., English), the most
      pronounced weakness appears to occur in phonological processing, whereas in
      phonologically easier languages (e.g., German), the crucial role in the
      manifestation of dyslexia is played by the lack of the skills needed to achieve
      automatization. (3) There is abundant evidence that reading (i.e., any single act
      of reading as well as reading as a holistic process) is "cooked" by the brain.
      Although no unified brain map of reading has been developed, some specific areas 
      of the brain have been implicated in different reading-related cognitive
      processes by different laboratories and on different samples. (4) Indisputable
      evidence has been accumulated suggesting the involvement of the genome in
      developmental dyslexia. As of now, specific regions of the genome have been
      identified as being intimately involved with a number of different
      reading-related processes. Today the field of developmental dyslexia is the only 
      area of genetic studies of human abilities and disabilities in which linkages to 
      the genome have been robustly replicated in independent laboratories. (5)
      Finally, evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia might be only one of the
      manifestations of a deep, underlying, anatomical syndrome. The comorbidity of
      developmental dyslexia with both internalizing and externalizing behavioral
      disturbances, as well as with other learning disabilities, underscores the need
      for wide-ranging cognitive and behavioral approaches in the remediation programs 
      offered to dyslexic children.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia is a familial learning disability.
PG  - 59-65
AB  - Whereas current evidence attests to a genetic component in the etiology of
      dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), little is known
      about the role of genetics in developmental dyscalculia (DC). The objective of
      this study was to determine the familial aggregation of DC. Siblings and parents 
      of children with DC were assessed for arithmetic, reading and attention
      disorders. The criteria for DC were an IQ higher than 85, poor performance in
      arithmetic, and a significant discrepancy between arithmetic achievement and IQ. 
      The study group was composed of 39 children with DC, 21 mothers, 22 fathers, 90
      siblings, and 16 second-degree relatives. We found that 66% of mothers, 40% of
      fathers, 53% of siblings, and 44% of second-degree relatives had DC. The
      intraclass correlation between the sib pairs was .27. A 95% confidential interval
      (CI) for the prevalence of DC among siblings of DC probands (see Note 1) ranged
      from 40% to 64%, indicating a familial prevalence almost tenfold higher than
      expected for the general population. IQ and attention problems were not risk
      factors for DC. We conclude that DC, like other learning disabilities, has a
      significant familial aggregation, suggesting a role for genetics in the evolution
      of this disorder.

TI  - The eye movements of pure alexic patients during reading and nonreading tasks.
PG  - 983-1002
AB  - We compared the eye-movements of two patients who read letter-by-letter (LBL)
      following a left occipital lobe lesion with those of normal control subjects and 
      of hemianopic patients in two tasks: a nonreading visual search task and a text
      reading task. Whereas the LBL readers exhibited similar eye-movement patterns to 
      those of the other two groups on the nonreading task, their eye movements
      differed significantly during reading, as reflected in the disproportionate
      increase in the number and duration of fixations per word and in the regressive
      saccades per word. Importantly, relative to the two control groups,
      letter-by-letter readers also made more fixations per word as word length
      increased, especially as word frequency and word imageability decreased. Two
      critical results emerged from these experiments: First, the alteration in the
      oculomotor behavior of the LBL readers during reading is similar to that seen in 
      normal readers under difficult reading conditions, as well as in beginning
      readers and in those with developmental dyslexia, and appears to reflect
      difficulties in processing the visual stimulus. Second, the interaction of length
      with frequency and with imageability in determining the eye movement pattern is
      consistent with an interactive activation model of normal word recognition in
      which weakened activation of orthographic input can nevertheless engage
      high-level lexical factors.

      target appeared inside a circle acting as focusing cue and in 30% of the cases it
      appeared outside, allowing us to study the distribution of attentional resources 
      outside the selected area. Normally reading children showed a normal symmetric
      distribution of attention. Indeed, RTs were directly proportional to the
      eccentricity of the target, and no visual field effect was observable. In
      contrast, children with SRD showed an anomalous and asymmetric distribution. The 
      effect of the target eccentricity influenced RTs only when the stimulus was
      projected in the left visual field, whereas no effect was observable when the
      stimulus was projected in the right visual field. Findings allowed us to discuss 
      the relation between this anomalous spatial distribution of visual attentional
      resources and dyslexia. To interpret the visual perceptual difficulties of
      children with SRD the hypothesis was made of a selective disorder of spatial
      attention (left inattention and right over-distractibility) related to a right
      parietal cortex dysfunction.

TI  - Behaviour problems in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 251-6
AB  - The association between behaviour problems and dyslexia was assessed in a
      population sample of 10- to 12-year-old children. Twenty-five dyslexic children
      and a matched control group were recruited through a screening in primary schools
      in the city of Bergen, Norway. For the assessment of behaviour problems the Child
      Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Self Report (TRF), and Youth Self Report (YSR)
      were filled out by parents, teachers, and children, respectively. Information on 
      health and developmental factors were obtained from parents on a separate
      questionnaire designed for the study. The dyslexic group had significantly more
      behaviour problems than the control group according to both the CBCL and the TRF.
      On the YSR there was no significant difference between the groups. Dyslexic
      children had higher CBCL and TRF scores on the Total Behaviour Problem scale, the
      Internalizing and Externalizing subdomains, and the Attention problem subscale.
      The groups differed in social background, prenatal risk factors, birth weight,
      preschool language problems, and IQ, but these variables showed no relationship
      to the level of behaviour problems in the present sample. We conclude that
      pre-adolescent dyslexic children show a wide range of behaviour problems that
      cannot be attributed to social or developmental background variables.

TI  - Disruption of the neural response to rapid acoustic stimuli in dyslexia: evidence
      from functional MRI.
PG  - 13907-12
AB  - The biological basis for developmental dyslexia remains unknown. Research has
      suggested that a fundamental deficit in dyslexia is the inability to process
      sensory input that enters the nervous system rapidly and that deficits in
      processing rapid acoustic information are associated with impaired reading.
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify the brain basis
      of rapid acoustic processing in normal readers and to discover the status of that
      response in dyslexic readers. Normal readers showed left prefrontal activity in
      response to rapidly changing, relative to slowly changing, nonlinguistic acoustic
      stimuli. Dyslexic readers showed no differential left frontal response. Two
      dyslexic readers participated in a remediation program and showed increased
      activity in left prefrontal cortex after training. These fMRI results identify
      left prefrontal regions as normally being sensitive to rapid relative to slow
      acoustic stimulation, insensitive to the difference between such stimuli in
      dyslexic readers, and plastic enough in adulthood to develop such differential
      sensitivity after intensive training.

TI  - The neurological basis of developmental dyslexia: an overview and working
      hypothesis.
PG  - 2373-99
AB  - Five to ten per cent of school-age children fail to learn to read in spite of
      normal intelligence, adequate environment and educational opportunities. Thus
      defined, developmental dyslexia (hereafter referred to as dyslexia) is usually
      considered of constitutional origin, but its actual mechanisms are still
      mysterious and currently remain the subject of intense research endeavour in
      various neuroscientific areas and along several theoretical frameworks. This
      article reviews evidence accumulated to date that favours a dysfunction of neural
      systems known to participate in the normal acquisition and achievement of reading
      and other related cognitive functions. Historically, the first arguments for a
      neurological basis of dyslexia came from neuropathological studies of brains from
      dyslexic individuals. These early studies, although open to criticism, for the
      first time drew attention towards a possible abnormality in specific stages of
      prenatal maturation of the cerebral cortex and suggested a role of atypical
      development of brain asymmetries. This has prompted a large amount of subsequent 
      work using in vivo imaging methods in the same vein. These latter studies,
      however, have yielded less clear-cut results than expected, but have globally
      confirmed some subtle differences in brain anatomy whose exact significance is
      still under investigation. Neuropsychological studies have provided considerable 
      evidence that the main mechanism leading to these children's learning
      difficulties is phonological in nature, namely a basic defect in segmenting and
      manipulating the phoneme constituents of speech. A case has also been made for
      impairment in brain visual mechanisms of reading as a possible contributing
      factor. This approach has led to an important conceptual advance with the
      suggestion of a specific involvement of one subsystem of vision pathways (the
      so-called magnosystem hypothesis). Both phonological and visual hypotheses have
      received valuable contribution from modern functional imaging techniques. Results
      of recent PET and functional MRI studies are reported here in some detail.
      Finally, one attractive interpretation of available evidence points to dyslexia
      as a multi-system deficit possibly based on a fundamental incapacity of the brain
      in performing tasks requiring processing of brief stimuli in rapid temporal
      succession. It is proposed that this so-called 'temporal processing impairment'
      theory of dyslexia could also account for at least some of the perceptual, motor 
      and cognitive symptoms very often associated with the learning disorder, a
      coincidence that has remained unexplained so far.

TI  - Use of temporal envelope cues by children with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1367-79
AB  - This study evaluates the ability to process auditory temporal-envelope cues in a 
      group of 6 children with dyslexia (mean age: 10;10 years;months). To address this
      issue, we measured (a) temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs), that is,
      the detection thresholds of sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM) applied to a
      white noise carrier, as a function of modulation frequency, fm (fm was 4, 16, 64,
      256, and 1,024 Hz) and (b) identification performance for vowel-consonant-vowel
      (VCV) stimuli over 5 sessions. VCV stimuli were either unprocessed or digitally
      processed to remove the original spectral information, resulting in a
      time-varying speech envelope amplitude modulating a noise carrier. The same tests
      were conducted in 6 normal control children (mean age: 11;6 years;months) and 6
      normal control adults (mean age: 24;8 years;months). SAM thresholds were similar 
      in normal children and adults. For both normal groups, TMTFs were low pass in
      shape and showed low between-listener variability. TMTFs measured in children
      with dyslexia showed higher between-listener variability: TMTFs were band pass in
      2 children, flat in 1 child, and low pass in the 3 others. Overall, SAM
      thresholds were higher in children with dyslexia than in normal children at fm = 
      4 and 1,024 Hz. Unprocessed-speech identification performance was nearly perfect 
      in normal children and adults, and impaired in children with dyslexia.
      "Speech-envelope noise" identification performance was poorer in normal children 
      and children with dyslexia than in normal adults. Performance improved across
      sessions in normal children and adults, but remained constant in children with
      dyslexia. Compared to normal children, children with dyslexia showed poorer
      reception of voicing, manner, and place of articulation for unprocessed speech
      and poorer reception of voicing for "speech-envelope noise." Taken together,
      these results support the hypothesis that some children with dyslexia may show
      abnormal auditory temporal-envelope processing. Such a deficit, in turn, may
      explain the difficulties of children with dyslexia with speech perception.

TI  - Selective deficits of vibrotactile sensitivity in dyslexic readers.
PG  - 13-6
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a disability of literacy skill that has also been
      associated with sensory processing deficits, primarily for the detection of
      dynamic auditory and visual stimuli. Here we examined whether analogous deficits 
      extend into the domain of somatosensory perception. Detection thresholds for each
      of three frequencies of vibration were obtained for 11 readers with a prior
      history of dyslexia and 14 similarly aged adult controls. The poor readers were
      significantly less sensitive to vibration at 3 Hz (P<0. 01) but not at either 30 
      or 100 Hz. Detection of each of these three vibration rates is mediated primarily
      by a separate somatosensory fiber tract; deficits selective to 3 Hz therefore
      suggest an impairment within the slow-adapting I (SAI) fiber system beginning
      with Merkel-cell mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin. Such evidence is
      compatible with the hypothesis of a generalized, multisensory deficit of temporal
      processing functions in dyslexia.

TI  - New-onset tic disorder following acute hemorrhage of an arteriovenous
      malformation.
PG  - 769-71
AB  - The etiology of tic disorder includes idiopathic, postencephalitic, head injury, 
      carbon monoxide poisoning, stroke, and developmental syndromes. We report a case 
      of new-onset complex motor and vocal tics that began after hemorrhage of an
      arteriovenous malformation located in the left frontal lobe. We have found no
      reported cases of new-onset tics related to arteriovenous malformations or
      hemorrhage into the frontal lobes. The patient is a 16-year-old
      right-hand-dominant boy who presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
      Evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging, revealed a left frontal
      arteriovenous malformation, confirmed by angiogram. Following resection, there
      was an intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the left frontal lobe with intraventricular
      hemorrhage, noted most prominently in the left lateral and IIIrd ventricles, and 
      a subdural hematoma caudal to the craniotomy. The postoperative course was
      complicated by hemiparesis and global aphasia. During recovery, the patient
      developed what was thought to be a complex partial seizure evidenced by head
      turning to the right with vocalization and left upper extremity clonic jerks.
      These were brief and occurred multiple times per day. A trial of carbamazepine
      was given with no improvement. It was noted that the spells occurred more
      frequently under stress, as when the patient was frustrated with communication.
      The diagnosis was changed to complex motor tics and the therapy changed to
      clonidine. The tics subsequently improved by 80%, although they were still
      present. We believe the development of complex motor tics due to frontal
      hemorrhage represents a unique etiology and could complicate postsurgical
      recovery in similar cases.

TI  - Rate of information segregation in developmentally dyslexic children.
PG  - 66-81
AB  - Slowed processing of sequential perceptual information is related to
      developmental dyslexia. We investigated this unimodally and crossmodally in
      developmentally dyslexic children and controls ages 8-12 years. The participants 
      judged whether two spatially separate trains of brief stimuli, presented at
      various stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) in one or two senses, were synchronous 
      or not. The stimulus trains consisted of light flashes in vision, clicks in
      audition, and indentations of the skin in the tactile sense. The dyslexic readers
      required longer SOAs than controls for successful performance in all six
      comparisons. The crossmodal spatiotemporal resolution of the groups differed more
      than unimodal performance. The dyslexic readers' segregation performance was also
      less differentiated than that of the controls. Our results show that not only
      sensory but also polysensory nonverbal information processing is temporally
      impaired in dyslexic children.

TI  - The use of orthographic and phonological strategies for the decoding of words in 
      children with developmental dyslexia and average readers.
PG  - 231-47
AB  - Children with developmental dyslexia are known to have problems with phonological
      awareness and, in particular, with phonological decoding. This study was aimed at
      determining the relationship between orthographic and phonological decoding
      strategies used by a group of children with developmental dyslexia and two groups
      of children who were average readers (matched on reading age and chronological
      age, respectively). The three groups of children, 12 in each, were presented with
      single words, either visually or orally. The children were asked to pronounce
      these words using either an orthographic (spelling) strategy following mental
      deletion of one letter, or a phonological (sounding) strategy following mental
      deletion of one sound. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the reading age
      control group were more accurate when using phonological strategies than when
      using orthographic strategies, whereas the chronological age control group
      generally showed superior orthographic and phonological processing abilities
      compared with both the developmental dyslexia and reading age control groups.
      Compared with both chronological and reading age control groups, children in the 
      developmental dyslexia group had more difficulty when using a phonological
      strategy, particularly when words were presented auditorily. However, compared
      with their performance on phonological tasks, the developmental dyslexia group
      performed at a level commensurate with their age when carrying out the
      orthographic tasks.

TI  - Auditory temporal processing and lexical/nonlexical reading in developmental
      dyslexics.
PG  - 501-13
AB  - Relationships between lexical/nonlexical reading and auditory temporal processing
      were examined. Poor nonlexical readers (poor nonword readers, phonologic
      dyslexics) had difficulty across tone tasks irrespective of speed of presentation
      or mode of recall. Poor lexical readers (poor irregular word readers, surface
      dyslexics) had difficulty recalling tones in a sequence only when they were
      presented rapidly. Covariate analysis supported these findings, revealing that
      nonlexical (nonword) reading performance is associated with general auditory
      performance, but lexical (irregular word) reading is particularly associated with
      auditory sequencing. These findings suggest that phonologic and surface dyslexics
      perform differently on nonspeech auditory tasks. Because the two different types 
      of poor readers did not differ significantly on tests of memory and learning but 
      did differ on auditory tasks, we suggest that their performance on the auditory
      tasks may reflect auditory processing abnormalities as opposed to more general
      learning or memory difficulties. In addition to these observed qualitative
      differences between groups on the tone tasks, collapsing groups (all readers)
      revealed significant correlations between nonword reading and the Same-Different 
      tone tasks in particular, whereas irregular word reading was not associated with 
      any tone tasks; there also appears to be a quantitative relationship between
      nonlexical reading and Same-Different tone task performance as better or worse
      nonword reading predicts better or worse performance on the Same-Different tone
      tasks. In particular, it is conceivable that an auditory temporal processing
      deficit might contribute to poor nonword reading.

TI  - Two translocations of chromosome 15q associated with dyslexia.
PG  - 771-5
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is characterised by difficulties in learning to read. As
      reading is a complex cognitive process, multiple genes are expected to contribute
      to the pathogenesis of dyslexia. The genetics of dyslexia has been a target of
      molecular studies during recent years, but so far no genes have been identified. 
      However, a locus for dyslexia on chromosome 15q21 (DYX1) has been established in 
      previous linkage studies. We have identified two families with balanced
      translocations involving the 15q21-q22 region. In one family, the translocation
      segregates with specific dyslexia in three family members. In the other family,
      the translocation is associated with dyslexia in one family member. We have
      performed fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies to refine the
      position of the putative dyslexia locus further. Our results indicate that both
      translocation breakpoints on 15q map within an interval of approximately 6-8 Mb
      between markers D15S143 and D15S1029, further supporting the presence of a locus 
      for specific dyslexia on 15q21.

TI  - Enterocolitis in children with developmental disorders.
PG  - 2285-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intestinal pathology, i.e., ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia
      (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental
      disorders. This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological
      characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected
      children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and 
      compares them with pediatric controls. METHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were
      performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male).
      Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five),
      disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one). Severity of ileal LNH was graded 
      (0-3) in both affected children and 37 developmentally normal controls (median
      age 11 yr, range 2-13 yr) who were investigated for possible inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Tissue sections were reviewed by three pathologists and scored on 
      a standard proforma. Data were compared with ileocolonic biopsies from 22
      histologically normal children (controls) and 20 children with ulcerative colitis
      (UC), scored in an identical manner. Gut pathogens were sought routinely.
      RESULTS: Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of
      35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%)
      affected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically,
      reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies
      from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD
      controls (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected
      children but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%)
      affected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) 
      with UC. Scores of frequency and severity of inflammation were significantly
      greater in both affected children and those with UC, compared with controls (p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A new variant of inflammatory bowel disease is present in
      this group of children with developmental disorders.

TI  - Spatial cognition in children. II. Visuospatial and constructional skills in
      developmental reading disability.
PG  - 368-72
AB  - Cognitive models for developmental dyslexia are nowadays centered on the
      hypothesis of a specific deficit within the phonologic module of the language
      system. To ascertain whether defects of spatial cognition are associated with
      developmental reading disability, we investigated a sample of 43 school children 
      (aged 8-9 years) found to be reading impaired during a wide screening survey for 
      developmental dyslexia in the province of Naples, Italy. After one year all
      children were tested again and only 9/43 still presented reading impairment,
      while the remaining had achieved a variable range of spontaneous recovery. A
      detailed analysis was performed on all children to characterize their cognitive
      performances using on one hand classical conventional tests for constructional
      praxis, visuospatial cognition, and visuospatial memory and on the other a
      specific neuropsychological battery for constructional disorders. The results of 
      our study demonstrated that children with long-lasting reading impairment
      exhibited normal performances on spatial cognition tasks. Moreover, one single
      child was found with relevant visuospatial deficits pointing to the possible
      existence of a visuospatial subtype for developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Dyslexia: a developmental language disorder.
PG  - 355-80
AB  - The acquisition of literacy in an alphabetic script such as English makes heavy
      demands on linguistic skills. The relation between spoken and written language
      however, is far from straightforward. This article reviews the research that
      suggests that phonological processing skills are crucial in the translation of
      symbols to sounds, and the development of rapid and automatic decoding skills. It
      examines research that indicates that children whose phonological processing
      skills are compromised in some way, are at-risk of experiencing difficulties in
      the acquisition of literacy; it supports the suggestion that dyslexia can be
      viewed as lying on the continuum of developmental language disorders. It goes on 
      to relate theory to practice and discusses the responsibilities of health care
      professionals in relation to the early identification of dyslexia, and makes
      suggestions regarding intervention. In particular, it looks at the
      responsibilities of speech and language therapy services in the care and
      management of children with dyslexia.

TI  - Impaired processing of complex auditory stimuli in rats with induced
      cerebrocortical microgyria: An animal model of developmental language
      disabilities.
PG  - 828-39
AB  - Individuals with developmental language disabilities, including developmental
      dyslexia and specific language impairment (SLI), exhibit impairments in
      processing rapidly presented auditory stimuli. It has been hypothesized that
      these deficits are associated with concurrent deficits in speech perception and, 
      in turn, impaired language development. Additionally, postmortem analyses of
      human dyslexic brains have revealed the presence of focal neocortical
      malformations such as cerebrocortical microgyria. In an initial study bridging
      these research domains, we found that male rats with induced microgyria were
      impaired in discriminating rapidly presented auditory stimuli. In order to
      further assess this anatomical- behavioral association, we designed two
      experiments using auditory-reflex modification. These studies were intended to
      assess whether auditory processing deficits in microgyric male rats would be seen
      in threshold detection of a silent gap in white noise, and in oddball detection
      of a two-tone stimulus of variable duration. Results showed no differences
      between sham and microgyric subjects on gap detection, but did show that
      microgyric subjects were impaired in the discrimination of two-tone stimuli
      presented in an oddball paradigm. This impairment was evident for stimuli with
      total duration of 64 msec or less, while both groups were able to discriminate
      stimuli with duration of 89 msec or greater. The current results further support 
      the relationship between malformations of the cerebral cortex and deficits in
      rapid auditory processing. They also suggest that the parameters characterizing
      rapid auditory processing deficits for a specific task may be influenced by
      stimulus features and/or cognitive demand of that particular task.

TI  - Abnormal functional activation during a simple word repetition task: A PET study 
      of adult dyslexics.
PG  - 753-62
AB  - Eight dyslexic subjects, impaired on a range of tasks requiring phonological
      processing, were matched for age and general ability with six control subjects.
      Participants were scanned using positron emission tomography (PET) during three
      conditions: repeating real words, repeating pseudowords, and rest. In both
      groups, speech repetition relative to rest elicited widespread bilateral
      activation in areas associated with auditory processing of speech; there were no 
      significant differences between words and pseudowords. However, irrespective of
      word type, the dyslexic group showed less activation than the control group in
      the right superior temporal and right post-central gyri and also in the left
      cerebellum. Notably, the right anterior superior temporal cortex (Brodmann's area
      22 [BA 22]) was less activated in each of the eight dyslexic subjects, compared
      to each of the six control subjects. This deficit appears to be specific to
      auditory repetition as it was not detected in a previous study of reading which
      used the same sets of stimuli (Brunswick, N., McCrory, E., Price, C., Frith,
      C.D., & Frith, U. [1999]. Explicit and implicit processing of words and
      pseudowords by adult developmental dyslexics: A search for Wernicke's Wortschatz?
      Brain, 122, 1901-1917). This implies that the observed neural manifestation of
      developmental dyslexia is task-specific (i.e., functional rather than
      structural). Other studies of normal subjects indicate that attending to the
      phonetic structure of speech leads to a decrease in right-hemisphere processing. 
      Lower right hemisphere activation in the dyslexic group may therefore indicate
      less processing of non-phonetic aspects of speech, allowing greater salience to
      be accorded to phonological aspects of attended speech.

      disabled readers face and the steps necessary to help these children achieve
      independent reading skills. A framework of phonologically based remediation was
      used as a foundation upon which a set of flexible and effective word
      identification strategies were scaffolded in an integrated developmental
      sequence. The program uses a combination of direct instruction and dialogue-based
      metacognitive training, with the pedagogical emphasis shifting from an initial
      direct instruction, remedial focus to increasingly metacognitive-strategy-based
      methods. A continuum of intervention over 70 hours provides both (a) remediation 
      of the basic phonological awareness and letter-sound-learning deficits of
      disabled readers and (b) specific training of five word identification strategies
      that offer different approaches to the decoding of unfamiliar words and exposure 
      to different levels of subsyllabic segmentation. Explicit instruction in the
      application and monitoring of multiple word identification strategies and their
      application to text-reading activities continues throughout the PHAST Program.
      PHAST training provides the disabled reader with the opportunity to become a
      flexible reader who approaches new words in or out of context with multiple
      strategies and has the ability to evaluate the success of their application. The 
      PHAST Program was developed following the controlled evaluation of its components
      in laboratory classroom settings and recent positive results from their
      sequential combination. PHAST represents a new integrated approach to programming
      in this area using instructional components that have already demonstrated their 
      efficacy with children with severe reading disabilities.

PG  - 113-33
AB  - Two systems for classification of morphology of the perisylvian cortical area
      have been suggested, that of Steinmetz et al. (1990) and that of Witelson and
      Kigar (1992). This study examines whether the variations in placement of these
      convolutions in the language cortex are related to diagnosis of dyslexia in a
      clinic-referred sample of 55 children ages 8 to 12 years. Additionally, the
      systems are compared to determine their relationship to neurolinguistic
      performance. In this study, the Steinmetz et al. (1990) system captured
      morphological distinctions which were relevant to performance on neurolinguistic 
      measures, while Witelson and Kigar's (1992) system did not. Under neither system 
      was morphology associated with diagnosis of dyslexia.

TI  - Cerebral mechanisms involved in word reading in dyslexic children: a magnetic
      source imaging approach.
PG  - 809-16
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to describe spatiotemporal brain
      activation profiles during word reading using magnetic source imaging (MSI). Ten 
      right-handed dyslexic children with severe phonological decoding problems and
      eight age-matched non-impaired readers were tested in two recognition tasks, one 
      involving spoken and the other printed words. Dyslexic children's activation
      profiles during the printed word recognition task consistently featured
      activation of the left basal temporal cortices followed by activation of the
      right temporoparietal areas (including the angular gyrus). Non-impaired readers
      showed predominant activation of left basal followed by left temporoparietal
      activation. In addition, we were able to rule out the hypothesis that
      hypoactivation of left temporoparietal areas in dyslexics was due to a more
      general cerebral dysfunction in these areas. Rather, it seems likely that reading
      difficulties in developmental dyslexia are associated with an aberrant pattern of
      functional connectivity between brain areas normally involved in reading, namely 
      ventral visual association cortex and temporoparietal areas in the left
      hemisphere. The interindividual consistency of activation profiles characteristic
      of children with dyslexia underlines the potential utility of this technique for 
      examining neurophysiological changes in response to specific educational
      intervention approaches.

PG  - 188-201
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of a specific developmental disorder of reading,
      writing and arithmetic can be made based upon individually applied standardized
      methods for testing scholastic achievement and IQ. To make the choice of suitable
      methods easier for the administrator of the test, a critical survey of
      German-language methods for assessing skills in reading, writing and arithmetic
      is presented. METHODS: Test intention and psychometric properties for scholastic 
      achievement are summarized. The methods are assessed with regard to their utility
      in the diagnosis of congenital alexia and dyscalculia. Supplementary suggestions 
      for clinical assessment are given. RESULTS: In summary, beyond the primary school
      area there is a lack of current standardized methods that meet the current
      standards of quality. Particularly the assessment of arithmetic skills above
      those of the 4th grade level require resorting to methods of dubious curricular
      validity. Coverage is once again better for the upper elementary and middle
      school levels. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for new constructions, respectively a
      need to update published scholastic achievement tests.

TI  - Morphological alteration of temporal lobe gray matter in dyslexia: an MRI study.
PG  - 637-44
AB  - Functional imaging studies of developmental dyslexia have reported reduced
      task-related neural activity in the temporal and inferior parietal cortices. To
      examine the possible contribution of subtle anatomic deviations to these
      reductions, volumes were measured for the major lobes of the brain, the
      subcortical nuclei, cerebellum, and lateral ventricles on magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans from 16 right-handed dyslexic men, ages 18 to 40, and 14
      matched controls, most of whom had previously undergone PET imaging. A specific
      decrease in tissue volume was localized to the temporal lobes and was
      particularly prominent on the left (p < .01). An analysis of tissue composition
      revealed that this reduction was primarily attributable to decreased gray matter 
      within the left temporal lobe (p < .002). Further segmentation of the temporal
      lobe showed that this reduction was not confined to the superior temporal gyrus, 
      the primary location of primary auditory cortex. Reductions of temporal lobe gray
      matter may reflect a regional decrease in neuronal number or neuropil, which in
      turn may result in reading impairment.

TI  - Retrieval, automaticity, vocabulary elaboration, orthography (RAVE-O): a
      comprehensive, fluency-based reading intervention program.
PG  - 375-86
AB  - The most important implication of the double-deficit hypothesis (Wolf & Bowers,
      in this issue) concerns a new emphasis on fluency and automaticity in
      intervention for children with developmental reading disabilities. The RAVE-O
      (Retrieval, Automaticity, Vocabulary Elaboration, Orthography) program is an
      experimental, fluency-based approach to reading intervention that is designed to 
      accompany a phonological analysis program. In an effort to address multiple
      possible sources of dysfluency in readers with disabilities, the program involves
      comprehensive emphases both on fluency in word attack, word identification, and
      comprehension and on automaticity in underlying componential processes (e.g.,
      phonological, orthographic, semantic, and lexical retrieval skills). The goals,
      theoretical principles, and applied activities of the RAVE-O curriculum are
      described with particular stress on facilitating the development of rapid
      orthographic pattern recognition and on changing children's attitudes toward
      language.

TI  - Remediating the core deficits of developmental reading disability: a
      double-deficit perspective.
PG  - 334-58
AB  - The double-deficit hypothesis (Wolf, 1997; Wolf & Bowers, 1999, this issue)
      contends that deficits in phonological awareness and deficits in visual naming
      speed represent two independent causal impediments to reading acquisition for
      children with developmental reading disabilities (RD). One hundred and sixty-six 
      children with severe RD from 7 to 13 years of age were classified into three
      deficit subgroups according to a double-deficit framework. A total of 140
      children with RD, 84% of the sample, were classified; 54% demonstrated a double
      deficit (DD), 22% a phonological deficit only (PHON), and 24% a visual-naming
      speed deficit only (VNS). Diagnostic test profiles highlighted the joint
      contributions of the two core deficits in depressing written language
      acquisition. The children in the DD group were more globally impaired than those 
      in the other subgroups, and the VNS group children were the highest achieving and
      most selectively impaired readers. Following 35 hours of word identification
      training, sizable gains and significant generalization of training effects were
      achieved by all subgroups. A metacognitive phonics program resulted in greater
      generalized effects across the domain of real English words, and a phonological
      training program produced superior outcomes within the phonological processing
      domain. The greatest non-word reading gains were achieved by children with only
      phonological deficits.

TI  - Visual function, fatty acids and dyslexia.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - There is mounting evidence that developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental
      disorder which involves abnormalities of fatty acid metabolism, particularly with
      respect to certain long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs).
      Psychophysical evidence also strongly suggests that dyslexics may have visual
      deficits as well as phonological problems. Specifically, these visual deficits
      appear to be related to the magnocellular pathway, which is specialized for
      processing fast, rapidly-changing information about the visual scene. It remains 
      unclear how these two aspects of dyslexia - fatty acid processing and visual
      magnocellular function - could be related. We propose some hypotheses -
      necessarily speculative, given the paucity of biochemical research in this field 
      to date - which address this question.

TI  - Dyslexia in adults is associated with clinical signs of fatty acid deficiency.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a complex syndrome whose exact cause remains unknown.
      It has been suggested that a problem with fatty acid metabolism may play a role, 
      particularly in relation to the visual symptoms exhibited by many dyslexics. We
      explored this possibility using two self-report questionnaires, designed on the
      basis of clinical experience, to assess (1) clinical signs of fatty acid
      deficiency; and (2) symptoms associated with dyslexia in known dyslexic and
      non-dyslexic subjects. Dyslexic signs and symptoms included the
      auditory-linguistic and spoken language difficulties traditionally associated
      with the disorder, as well as visual problems (both with reading and more
      generally) and motor problems. Fatty acid deficiency signs were significantly
      elevated in dyslexic subjects relative to controls, particularly within males
      (P<0.001). In addition, the severity of these clinical signs of fatty acid
      deficiency was strongly correlated with the severity of dyslexic signs and
      symptoms not only in the visual domain, but also with respect to auditory,
      linguistic and motor problems. The pattern of relationships differed somewhat
      between dyslexic and control groups, and sex differences were also observed. Our 
      findings support the hypothesis that fatty acid metabolism may be abnormal in
      developmental dyslexia, and indicate the need for further studies using more
      objective measures.

TI  - Fatty acid deficiency signs predict the severity of reading and related
      difficulties in dyslexic children.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - It has been proposed that developmental dyslexia may be associated with relative 
      deficiencies in certain highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). In children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, minor physical signs of fatty acid
      deficiency have been shown to correlate with blood biochemical measures of HUFA
      deficiency. These clinical signs of fatty acid deficiency were therefore examined
      in 97 dyslexic children in relation to reading and related skills, and possible
      sex differences were explored. Children with high fatty acid deficiency ratings
      showed poorer reading (P<0.02) and lower general ability (P<0.04) than children
      with few such clinical signs. Within males (n=72) these relationships were
      stronger, and fatty acid deficiency signs were also associated with poorer
      spelling and auditory working memory (P<0.05, P<0.005 respectively). Within
      females (n=25) no associations were significant. These results support the
      hypothesis that fatty acid deficiency may contribute to the severity of dyslexic 
      problems, although sex differences merit further investigation.

TI  - Fatty acid metabolism in neurodevelopmental disorder: a new perspective on
      associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia,
      dyspraxia and the autistic spectrum.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - There is increasing evidence that abnormalities of fatty acid and membrane
      phospholipid metabolism play a part in a wide range of neurodevelopmental and
      psychiatric disorders. This proposal is discussed here in relation to
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, developmental
      coordination disorder (dyspraxia) and the autistic spectrum. These are among the 
      most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood, with significant
      implications for society as well as for those directly affected. However,
      controversy still surrounds both the identification and management of these
      conditions, and while their aetiology is recognized as being complex and
      multifactorial, little progress has yet been made in elucidating predisposing
      factors at the biological level. An overview is provided here of the contents of 
      this Special Issue, which contains a selection of reports from a unique
      multidisciplinary workshop involving both researchers and clinicians. Its purpose
      was to explore the possibility that ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia and autism fall
      within a phospholipid spectrum of disorders. This proposal could explain the high
      degree of co-morbidity between these conditions, their aggregation within
      families and relation to other psychiatric disorders, and a range of associated
      features that are already well known at a clinical level. The existing evidence
      for fatty acid abnormalities in these disorders is summarized, and new approaches
      are outlined that have the potential to improve both the identification and the
      management of these and related neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.

TI  - Learning disabilities: diagnostic considerations from an educational perspective.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - This article reviews the current definitions of specific learning disability
      (LD). It describes the multiple causes among the specific learning disability
      (SLD) population, citing cognitive, neuroanatomical, cellular, and genetic
      research trends. Emphasis is placed on assessment components and processes,
      including typically used academic, cognitive, and neuropsychological measures and
      newly introduced dynamic or domain-based approaches. Researchers and
      practitioners now acknowledge that SLD represents a life-long condition,
      manifesting differently at each developmental stage. The impact of LD on adult
      adjustment and independence is described as the newest challenge in the field of 
      LD research.

TI  - Atypical cognitive disorders in a man with developmental surface dyslexia.
PG  - 358-61
AB  - The neuropsychological profile of a man with a developmental surface dyslexia is 
      presented here. This case study is of interest because J.C. exhibited a pattern
      of cognitive disorders rarely documented in previous data. Results showed that
      JC's difficulties in reading comprehension were closely related to complex memory
      disorders and were also associated with cognitive slowness. The present
      observations do not support the visual memory failure hypothesis. The data rather
      suggest that the core difficulty primarily lies with the nonautomatization of
      grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules, which in turn dramatically contributed to 
      lexicon weaknesses. The hypothesis of a timing mechanism in reading disorders is 
      discussed.

TI  - Asynchronous language acquisition in developmental dysphasia.
PG  - 352-7
AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted to document and compare evolution of children 
      with linguistic acquisition impairment. To determine whether development of the
      analytic mechanisms underlying linguistic processing occured in similar fashion, 
      two children with mixed developmental dysphasia were assessed from 4 to 5:6 years
      of age with psycholinguistic tests at 6-months interval. Spontaneous speech and
      language production (consonant repertory in initial word position, MLU, and
      lexical diversity) were investigated in a standardized symbolic play context. The
      phonologic and lexico-morphologic evolution analyses revealed a marked
      improvement in motor control of phonology and in the application of
      morphosyntaxic rules in child 1, whereas child 2 was still impaired in phonology 
      and morphosyntax. The singular developmental changes in spontaneous speech
      results indicate dynamic relationships between various language production facets
      and variability in the kind of deficit and lexical automation presented by these 
      children. These contrasts in the evolution of language production profiles
      between child 1 and child 2 also underline the importance of longitudinal studies
      in the analysis of the atypical linguistic processing paths used by children with
      developmental dysphasia.

TI  - Phonological awareness in French-speaking children at risk for reading
      disabilities.
PG  - 124-30
AB  - We report the phonological awareness abilities of preliterate French-speaking
      children. The performance of a group of children identified At Risk (n = 26) for 
      reading disabilities was compared to that of normally developing age-matched
      controls (n = 22) on a range of standardised and experimental tests. Results
      showed the At Risk children to have a selective impairment in expressive relative
      to receptive language, whereas Controls performed at equivalent levels on both
      measures. Although the children At Risk performed at a significantly lower level 
      than Controls on all but one of the metaphonological tests, their pattern of
      performance was similar to that of Controls, suggesting a developmental delay.
      Interestingly, both groups showed a superiority of awareness for syllables over
      phonemes, reflecting the phonological structure of the French language.

TI  - On subtypes of developmental dyslexia: evidence from processing time and accuracy
      scores.
PG  - 87-104
AB  - Phonological dyslexics (Ph-DYS) are characterized by a phonological deficit,
      while surface dyslexics (S-DYS) are characterized by an orthographic deficit.
      Four issues were addressed in this study. First, we determined the proportion of 
      Ph-DYS and S-DYS in a population of French dyslexics by applying Castles and
      Coltheart's (1993) regression method to two previously unused diagnostic
      measures: pseudo-word and irregular-word processing time. Thirty-one dyslexics
      were matched to 19 average readers of the same age (10 years, CA controls) and to
      19 younger children of the same reading level (8 years, RL controls). Compared to
      CA controls, there were more Ph-DYS than S-DYS. Compared to RL controls, there
      were still a high number of Ph-DYS; however, the S-DYS profile almost
      disappeared. Next, we examined the reliability of these subtypes across different
      measures of phonological and orthographic skills. Compared to RL controls, both
      groups of dyslexics were found to be impaired only in phonological skills, either
      in processing time (Ph-DYS) or in accuracy (S-DYS). Then we assessed the moment
      at which the two dissociated profiles emerged in the course of cognitive
      development. In order to do so, we examined earlier longitudinal data, collected 
      when the children were 7 and 8 years old, and found that only the S-DYS's
      orthographic deficit increased with development. Last, we looked at whether the
      Ph-DYS and S-DYS profiles were associated with other specific cognitive deficits.
      Specific deficits in phonemic awareness and in phonological short-term memory
      were found for both Ph-DYS and S-DYS. These data suggest that developmental
      dyslexia could be largely accounted for by an underlying phonological impairment.

      early occipital damage.
PG  - 365-76
AB  - This study reports the case of EBON, a fifteen-year-old right-handed female
      Swedish student, who suffered an early medial/dorsal occipital brain lesion and
      showed a clearly defined pattern of developmental surface dyslexia. EBON and 17
      controls were examined with within and cross-modality (visual and auditory) word 
      stem completion tasks together with tasks requiring free-recall and recognition
      for visually and auditory presented words. Compared to age-matched controls, EBON
      was found to show a significant deficit of visual priming following visual
      presentation, and a deficit approaching significance following auditory
      presentation. Explicit memory and visual and spatial abilities were not
      significantly different from controls. Therefore, EBON represents the first
      childhood case establishing the role of occipital regions in visual priming, as
      well as illustrating a profile of surface reading difficulty as a developmental
      consequence of this locus of lesion.

      from humans and animal models.
PG  - 511-33
AB  - Vulnerable periods during the development of the nervous system are sensitive to 
      environmental insults because they are dependent on the temporal and regional
      emergence of critical developmental processes (i.e., proliferation, migration,
      differentiation, synaptogenesis, myelination, and apoptosis). Evidence from
      numerous sources demonstrates that neural development extends from the embryonic 
      period through adolescence. In general, the sequence of events is comparable
      among species, although the time scales are considerably different. Developmental
      exposure of animals or humans to numerous agents (e.g., X-ray irradiation,
      methylazoxymethanol, ethanol, lead, methyl mercury, or chlorpyrifos) demonstrates
      that interference with one or more of these developmental processes can lead to
      developmental neurotoxicity. Different behavioral domains (e.g., sensory, motor, 
      and various cognitive functions) are subserved by different brain areas. Although
      there are important differences between the rodent and human brain, analogous
      structures can be identified. Moreover, the ontogeny of specific behaviors can be
      used to draw inferences regarding the maturation of specific brain structures or 
      neural circuits in rodents and primates, including humans. Furthermore, various
      clinical disorders in humans (e.g., schizophrenia, dyslexia, epilepsy, and
      autism) may also be the result of interference with normal ontogeny of
      developmental processes in the nervous system. Of critical concern is the
      possibility that developmental exposure to neurotoxicants may result in an
      acceleration of age-related decline in function. This concern is compounded by
      the fact that developmental neurotoxicity that results in small effects can have 
      a profound societal impact when amortized across the entire population and across
      the life span of humans.

TI  - The spatial distribution of visual attention in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 531-8
AB  - The present study investigated the spatial distribution of visual attention in
      dyslexic and normally reading children. The performances of the two groups were
      investigated using two different paradigms. In experiment 1 we analyzed the
      distribution of processing resources both inside and outside the focus of visual 
      attention by simply recording reaction times to the detection of a white dot
      target projected at different eccentricities from the fovea. The distribution of 
      attentional resources differed significantly between the two groups of children. 
      The eccentricity of the stimulus was significant only for normally reading
      children - who showed a normal gradient - as it influenced their detection speed,
      whereas it had no effect on dyslexic children, who exhibited a diffused
      distribution of visual processing resources inside the visual field. In
      experiment 2 we studied the distributed (unfocused) mode of attention in a visual
      search task by measuring reaction times to a target stimulus inside a large
      configuration with a variable number of distractors. Results show that as
      compared to normal children dyslexics are better able to distribute their
      attentional resources diffusely. Our conclusion is that reading disability may be
      characterized by a diffused distribution of visual processing resources. These
      data might be interpreted in the framework of studies on magnocellular deficits
      in dyslexia, whereby the anomalous distribution of visual attention might explain
      how transient pathway functioning influences the reading process.

PG  - 251-65
AB  - L asymmetry in beta activity in the dyslexic group, again in both tasks. Theta
      activity did discriminate between the two tasks in the dyslexic group. In the
      phonological task, task-related frontal theta in the dyslexic group was
      significantly different from the control group, with the former showing an
      increase in amplitude and the latter a decrease. In the visual task, there was no
      significant difference between the dyslexic and the control group, with both
      showing a task-related decrease in amplitude. The inter-task variations in EEG
      response in the dyslexic group paralleling variations in task performance are
      interpreted in terms of the varying engagement of a frontally-based attentional
      system. Inter-task consistencies of EEG response despite variations in
      performance are interpreted in terms of the continued application of a specific
      cognitive strategy.

TI  - Stability of gaze control in dyslexia.
PG  - 119-22
AB  - The neurobiological basis of saccade control has at least three components:
      fixation, reflexes, voluntary control. It was found in earlier studies that the
      voluntary component of saccade is specifically impaired in dyslexics as compared 
      with controls of the same age. In this study, we searched for evidence of
      fixation instability by analyzing the eye movements of 99 control subjects and
      262 dyslexics (age 7-17 years) performing an overlap prosaccade and a gap
      antisaccade task. The percentage of intrusive saccades was counted for each
      subject during a period of the trial where stationary fixation was required. Both
      groups showed improvements of fixation stability with age, but the dyslexic group
      exhibited developmental deficits. It is discussed whether these deficits could be
      interpreted as consequences of deficits in the magnocellular pathway.

TI  - Nontraumatic brain hemorrhage in children: etiology and presentation.
PG  - 284-9
AB  - The clinical and radiographic findings of 68 children and adolescents with
      nontraumatic intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage were analyzed retrospectively.
      There were 43 boys and 25 girls, and the average age was 7.1 years (range, 3
      months to 18 years). The most common presenting symptom was a combination of
      headache or vomiting (40 cases, or 58.8%). Hemiparesis was the major presenting
      sign in 11 (16.2%) of the children, seizures occurred in 25 (36.8%) patients, and
      6 (8.8%) children were irritable. Only 2 (2.9%) children were comatose at
      presentation. One or more risk factors for hemorrhage were found in 61 (89.7%) of
      68 children. A third (23 cases, or 33.8%) had an arteriovenous malformation or
      fistula; altogether 29 (42.6%) children had some type of congenital vascular
      anomaly. Hematologic or coagulation disorders were present in 22 (32.4%)
      patients, and 9 (13.2%) patients had brain tumors. Hemorrhage could not be
      attributed to systemic hypertension in any child. The likelihood of establishing 
      the cause of bleeding was greater when evaluation included cerebral angiography
      (97.3% versus 80.4% without angiography). Half (34 cases, or 50.0%) of the
      patients regained normal neurologic function. Six (8.8%) patients died, either
      directly or partly as a consequence of the hemorrhage. The remaining patients had
      various neurologic sequelae, including 17 (25.0%) with hemiparesis, 5 (7.4%) with
      aphasia, 7 (10.3%) with epileptic seizures, and 3 (4.4%) with hydrocephalus. More
      detailed follow-up studies are needed to obtain more information about the
      frequency of cognitive sequelae.

TI  - Treatment of specific developmental reading disorders, derived from single- and
      dual-route models.
PG  - 278-85
AB  - A group of 21 participants with specific reading disorders was treated with a
      method derived from dual-route models and another group of 23 with a method
      derived from single-route models of reading. Both treatments were compared with
      four control treatments. The reading performance of each participant was compared
      with that of his or her chronological-age controls on the following variables:
      speed and accuracy of reading passage, isolated words and nonwords, and accuracy 
      in homophone recognition. The treatment deriving from dual-route models produced 
      significant improvements in the homophone recognition, compared to all other
      treatments. The treatment deriving from single-route models produced significant 
      improvements, compared to all other treatments, in speed of word reading.
      Furthermore, these two treatments produced significant improvement with respect
      to all other treatments but one, in speed of nonword reading. These findings
      support the hypothesis that treatments derived from specific models of reading
      development are superior to other treatments. However the benefits obtained on
      the reading of isolated stimuli (words, homophones) did not significantly improve
      the reading of a passage. This fact suggests that treatments should include
      exercises involving passages or sentences.

TI  - Frontal processing and auditory perception.
PG  - 919-22
AB  - Disordered processing of the pattern in sound over time has been observed in a
      number of clinical disorders, including developmental dyslexia. This study
      addresses the brain mechanisms required for the perception of such a pattern. We 
      report the systematic evaluation of temporal perception in a patient with a
      single intact right auditory cortex and a large right frontal lobe lesion. A
      striking dissociated deficit was demonstrated in the perception of temporal
      pattern at the level of tens or hundreds of milliseconds. This proves that,
      contrary to common belief, mechanisms in the pathway up to and including the
      primary auditory cortex are not sufficient for the normal perception of temporal 
      pattern. This work suggests a need for frontal processing for the normal
      perception of auditory pattern.

PG  - 133-51
AB  - This paper attempts to integrate recent research findings in phonological
      development, reading development and dyslexia into a coherent theoretical
      framework that can provide a developmental account of reading and reading
      difficulties across languages. It is proposed that the factors governing
      phonological development across languages are similar, but that important
      differences in the speed and level of phonological development are found
      following the acquisition of alphabetic literacy. The causal framework offered is
      at the level of a cognitive model, which may prove useful in organizing future
      cross-linguistic developmental work.

TI  - Right body side performance decrement in congenitally dyslexic children and left 
      body side performance decrement in congenitally hyperactive children.
PG  - 89-100
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Simple and complex visuomotor performance of the right and left sides 
      of the body was investigated in 37 children with left hemisphere lesions, 35
      children with right hemisphere lesions, 53 developmentally dyslexic children, 29 
      developmentally hyperactive children, and 35 "normal" children who had endured a 
      very mild head injury with no sequelae. BACKGROUND: Lateralized soft signs, EEG
      topography, metabolic brain imaging, and neuropsychological test profiles suggest
      a predominance of left hemisphere dysfunction in dyslexia and right hemisphere
      dysfunction in hyperactivity. METHOD: Nine measures of lateralized performance
      were drawn from the Purdue pegboard, Letter cancellation, Rey complex figure,
      Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) Mazes, and WISC Picture
      completion tests. RESULTS: The children with left hemisphere lesions manifested
      significantly weaker performance on test components involving the right body
      side, relative to the normal controls, on the Purdue pegboard, Rey complex figure
      (delayed recall condition), and WISC Picture completion tests, and the dyslexic
      children on the former two. The children with right hemisphere lesions manifested
      significantly weaker performance on test components involving the left body side,
      relative to the normal controls, on the WISC Mazes test, as did the hyperactive
      children. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that (1) contralateral performance decrement
      results from a unilateral cortical lesion in children, and (2) developmental
      dyslexia may comprise a slight predominance of left hemisphere dysfunction and
      developmental hyperactivity of right hemisphere dysfunction.

PG  - 693-6
AB  - Underlying impairments in rapid auditory processing may contribute to disrupted
      phonological processing, which in turn characterizes developmental language
      impairment (LI). Identification of a neurobiological feature of LI that is
      associated with auditory deficits would further support this model. Accordingly, 
      we found that adult male rats with induced cortical malformations were impaired
      in rapid auditory processing. Since 40-60% of BXSB mice exhibit spontaneous focal
      cerebrocortical ectopias (as seen in dyslexics brains), we assessed auditory gap 
      detection in adult male BXSB mice. Ectopic mice were significantly worse than
      non-ectopics in detecting a 5 ms silent gap, but were not significantly impaired 
      at longer gap durations (10-100 ms). Our results confirm that focal cortical
      malformations are associated with impairments in rapid auditory processing.

TI  - Temporal processing deficits in remediation-resistant reading-impaired children.
PG  - 83-97
AB  - There is considerable interest in whether a deficit in temporal processing
      underlies specific learning and language disabilities in school-aged children.
      This view is particularly controversial in the area of developmental reading
      problems. The temporal-processing hypothesis was tested in a sample of normal
      children, 9-11 years of age, and in a sample of age-matched children with reading
      impairments, by assessing temporal-order discrimination. Five different binary
      temporal-order tasks were evaluated in the auditory and visual sensory
      modalities. Other basic discrimination abilities for single auditory stimuli were
      also assessed, including just noticeable differences (JNDs) for frequency and
      intensity and a simple threshold detection task. In these tasks, the temporal
      dimension was the duration of the individual stimuli (20 and 200 ms). All data
      were obtained using forced- choice psychophysical methods, either in a
      single-track adaptive format or using psychometric functions. The results from
      these experiments showed that children with reading impairments had deficits in
      temporal-order discrimination, but these effects were not modality specific.
      These same children also had significantly elevated frequency and intensity JNDs 
      and their performance on these tasks were not dependent on stimulus duration. No 
      group differences were observed on the threshold detection task, and the derived 
      measurements of temporal integration (i.e. the threshold difference between the
      20- and 200-ms stimuli) were considered normal, averaging 11.7 dB. As a whole,
      discrimination deficits observed in the reading-impaired group only occurred with
      suprathreshold stimuli. The deficits were neither modality specific nor temporal 
      (duration) specific.

TI  - Neuropsychological intervention in dyslexia: two studies on British pupils.
PG  - 137-48
AB  - The theoretical context of this research is developmental neuropsychology--in
      particular, the educational implications for the classification of and
      intervention in specific developmental dyslexia (SDD). Controlled and validated
      research can help identify optimal teaching methods for groups and individuals.
      Within this framework, neuropsychological theory can be explored as a medium for 
      improving intervention for pupils with SDD. Neuropsychological stimulation cannot
      change the macro aspects of the brain but can change its "finetuning" and its
      response to written text. Within the psycho-neurological approaches, Bakker
      (1979, 1990, 1998) developed both a diagnostic procedure and empirically
      investigated intervention procedures. The theory rests on the Balance Model of
      learning to read, in which differential hemisphere involvement is implicated in
      beginning and advanced reading. Intervention can take place via
      hemisphere-specific stimulation using visual or tactile stimulation or
      hemisphere-alluding stimulation using modified text. Two investigations are
      presented, one experimental and another clinical. The results support the
      validity of dyslexia subtyping and the effectiveness of the treatment methods.

TI  - Neocortical ectopias are associated with attenuated neurophysiological responses 
      to rapidly changing auditory stimuli.
PG  - 575-9
AB  - Developmental dyslexia has been separately associated with the presence of
      ectopic collections of neurons in layer I of neocortex (ectopias) and with
      alterations in processing rapidly changing stimuli. We have used BXSB/MpJ-Yaa
      mice, some of which have neocortical ectopias, to directly test the hypothesis
      that ectopias may alter auditory processing. Auditory event related potentials
      (AERPs) were elicited by pairs of 10.5 kHz tones separated by silence, 0.99 kHz, 
      or 5.6 kHz tones of variable duration. Half of the mice tested had 1-3 ectopias
      in frontal or parietal cortex, and half had no ectopias. Mice with ectopias
      showed a reduced response to the second 10.5 kHz stimuli only when it was
      preceded by short duration 5.6 kHz tones. These results indicate that BXSB mice
      are an excellent model for determining how focal neocortical anomalies alter
      sensory processing.

TI  - Visual-spatial attention in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 109-23
AB  - Orienting and focusing of visual attention are two processes strictly involved in
      reading. They were studied in a group of dyslexic children and normal readers.
      Shifting of attention by both peripheral and central visual cues was studied by
      means of the covert orienting paradigm. Focusing, consisting in the ability to
      control the size of the attentional focus, was investigated using simple reaction
      times in central vision. Results showed that dyslexics had a specific disability 
      in the shifting of attention caused by a peripheral cue at short SOAs, and were
      also able to maintain attention focused for short periods of time only,
      presumably not long enough for efficient visual processing. Our results support
      the suggestion that visual selective attention deficits in disabled readers may
      be due to a specific difficulty in orienting and focusing.

TI  - Precursors of literacy delay among children at genetic risk of dyslexia.
PG  - 203-13
AB  - This paper reports the literacy skills of 63 children selected as being at
      genetic risk of dyslexia compared with 34 children from families reporting no
      history of reading impairment. Fifty-seven per cent of the at-risk group were
      delayed in literacy development at 6 years compared with only 12% of controls.
      The "unimpaired" at-risk group were not statistically different from controls on 
      most cognitive and language measures at 45 months, whereas the literacy-delayed
      group showed significantly slower speech and language development, although they 
      did not differ from controls in nonverbal ability. Letter knowledge at 45 months 
      was the strongest predictor of literacy level at 6 years. In addition, early
      speech and language skills predicted individual differences in literacy outcome
      and genetic risk accounted for unique variance over and above these other
      factors. The results are discussed in terms of an interactive developmental model
      in which semantic and phonological skills support early reading acquisition.

TI  - [Max Isserlin--founder of child psychiatry in Munich].
PG  - 59-62
AB  - The early days of child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy at the
      beginning of the 20th century were governed by the schools of thought of that era
      and by personalities, who as physicians and researchers, recognized that
      disorders of mental development constituted a separate field. Among them was Max 
      Isserlin, who established the first hospital for child psychiatry in Munich, the 
      Heckscher Clinic, in 1929. Isserlin's landmark discoveries in psychiatry, above
      all those pertaining to aphasias, are still of topical interest today. He
      concentrated particularly upon speech development disorders, as well as upon what
      we today would refer to as described developmental disorders. From 1933 on
      Isserlin's personal fate was marked by persecution and displacement. The purpose 
      of this brief biographical sketch is to commemorate his work and to make visible 
      his place in modern thought.

TI  - Dark adaptation, motor skills, docosahexaenoic acid, and dyslexia.
PG  - 323S-6S
AB  - Dyslexia is a widespread condition characterized by difficulty with learning and 
      movement skills. It is frequently comorbid with dyspraxia (developmental
      coordination disorder), the chief characteristic of which is impaired movement
      skills, indicating that there may be some common biological basis to the
      conditions. Visual and central processing deficits have been found. The
      long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) are important components of
      retinal and brain membranes. In the preliminary studies reported here, dark
      adaptation was shown to be impaired in 10 dyslexic young adults when compared
      with a similar control group (P < 0.05, repeated-measures analysis of variance); 
      dark adaptation improved in 5 dyslexia patients after supplementation with a
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich fish oil for 1 mo (P < 0.05, paired t test on
      final rod threshold); and movement skills in a group of 15 dyspraxic children
      improved after 4 mo of supplementation with a mixture of high-DHA fish oil,
      evening primrose oil, and thyme oil (P < 0.007 for manual dexterity, P < 0.02 for
      ball skills, and P < 0.03 for static and dynamic balance; paired t tests). The
      studies were small and had designs that did not allow firm conclusions to be
      made. However, when considered with other evidence from another closely related
      condition, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which reduced ability to
      elongate and desaturate the essential fatty acids linoleic acid and
      alpha-linolenic acid to arachidonic acid and DHA, respectively, has been
      proposed, the studies suggest that more research, including double-blind,
      placebo-controlled studies, would be useful to clarify the benefits of LCPUFAs in
      dyslexia and other closely related conditions.

TI  - Exploring reading-spelling connection as locus of dyslexia in Chinese.
PG  - 239-59
LID - 10.1007/s11881-000-0024-4 [doi]
AB  - This paper advances the argument that in learning to read/spell Chinese
      characters and words, it is important for learners to understand the role of the 
      component parts. These constituents consist of phonetic and semantic radicals, or
      bujians, made up of clusters of strokes in their proper sequence. Beginning
      readers/spellers need to be sensitive to the positional hierarchy and internal
      structure of these constituent parts. Those Chinese children diagnosed with
      developmental dyslexia tend to have more difficulties in spelling Chinese
      characters and in writing to dictation than in reading. A lexical decision study 
      with two groups of tertiary students differing in their Chinese language ability 
      was carried out to test their efficiency in processing real and pseudo characters
      as a function of printed frequency of the characters, and the consistency of
      their component semantic radicals. There is some evidence that even for adult
      readers differing in their Chinese language ability, lexicality, frequency of
      characters and the consistency of the semantic radicals affect accurate and rapid
      character identification. Suggestions for research and teaching approaches are
      made to enhance the analysis and synthesis of the phonetic and semantic radicals 
      to promote efficient reading and spelling in Chinese.

PG  - 1-30

AB  - Until recently, many thought developmental dyslexia was a behavioral disorder
      that primarily affected reading. In fact, it is a partly heritable condition, the
      clinical manifestations of which are extremely complex including deficits in
      reading, working memory, sensorimotor coordination, and early sensory processing.
      Even though extensive research has characterized these behavioral abnormalities
      carefully, the biological mechanisms of the clinical manifestations still are
      poorly understood. Recent research into both the nature of the structural and
      functional abnormalities in developmental dyslexia and the functional
      neuroanatomy of reading have rapidly advanced our understanding of the
      localization of the processes responsible for the signs and symptoms of dyslexia.
      This paper reviews recent evidence supporting a biological basis for
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Monocular occlusion can improve binocular control and reading in dyslexics.
PG  - 164-70
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental condition which causes 5-10% of
      children to have unexpected difficulty learning to read. Many dyslexics have
      impaired development of the magnocellular component of the visual system, which
      is important for timing visual events and controlling eye movements. Poor control
      of eye movement may lead to unstable binocular fixation, and hence unsteady
      vision; this could explain why many dyslexics report that letters appear to move 
      around, causing visual confusion. Previous research has suggested that such
      binocular confusion can be permanently alleviated by temporarily occluding one
      eye. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess the binocular control
      and reading progress of dyslexic children with initially unstable binocular
      control after the left eye was patched. One hundred and forty-three dyslexics
      were studied. They were selected from children aged 7-11 years referred to a
      learning disabilities clinic if they were dyslexic and had unstable binocular
      control. They were randomly assigned to wear yellow spectacles with or without
      the left lens occluded, and were followed for 9 months. Significantly more of the
      children who were given occlusion gained stable binocular fixation in the first 3
      months (59%) compared with children given the unoccluded glasses (36%). This
      advantage was independent of IQ or initial reading ability. Furthermore, at all
      the 3-month follow-ups, children were more likely to have gained stable binocular
      control if they had been wearing the occluded glasses. Gaining stable binocular
      control significantly improved reading. The children who did so with the help of 
      occlusion improved their reading by 9.4 months in the first 3 months, compared
      with 3.9 months in those who were not patched and did not gain stable fixation.
      Over the whole 9 months, children who received occlusion and gained stable
      fixation nearly doubled their rate of progress in reading compared with those who
      remained unstable. At all the follow-ups the reading of those given occlusion was
      significantly better than that of those not occluded. Thus monocular occlusion
      helped children with unstable binocular control to gain good binocular fixation. 
      If they gained stability, they made significantly faster reading progress. The
      progress made by the children who gained stable fixation was much greater than
      that achieved with other remedial techniques.

TI  - Neuropsychological long-term outcome of rolandic EEG traits.
PG  - S63-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term outcome of rolandic epilepsy (RE) is associated with a
      diversity of neuropsychological deficits in childhood, although RE is
      historically considered as a benign epileptic disorder. Dyslexia and other
      developmental disorders are associated with rolandic EEG traits. Aim: To
      investigate if there is an association between the manifestation of a specific
      EEG trait of RE and dyslexia. If the EEG traits are causing dyslexia, the
      cognitive deficits are supposed to be normalised after the EEG trait have
      resolved. METHOD: Thirty adolescents and young adults, who had previously
      received a diagnosis of dyslexia by standard criteria, were included. Fifteen
      probands (mean age = 15.9) with dyslexia and rolandic EEG traits were compared
      with 15 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age = 16.0) with normal EEG. RESULTS:
      There were no statistical differences between the groups according to
      intelligence (Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Arithmetical IQ) or spelling ability.
      However, there was a significant difference between the groups in reading ability
      of non-related words with the group without RE performing better than the group
      with RE (p < 0.01). Attentional shifts in dichotic listening with forced or
      directed attention are generally found in 50-60% in normative samples. However,
      the present date suggest an impaired attentional shift in dichotic listening test
      for both groups. Only one third was able to modulate their ear-preference. There 
      were no group differences. CONCLUSION: In general, both dyslectic groups did not 
      show significant neuropsychological deficits as compared to standard controls.
      However, there were more reading errors and a tendency to attention impairments
      in the group with rolandic EEG trait as compared to the dyslectic group with
      normal EEG. Possible pathogenic factors are discussed.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia: prevalence and prognosis.
PG  - II58-64
AB  - The prevalence of developmental dyscalculia (DC) in the school population ranges 
      from 3-6 %, a frequency similar to that of developmental dyslexia and ADHD. These
      studies fulfilled the criteria for an adequate prevalence study, i.e., were
      population based, using standardized measures to evaluate arithmetic function.
      Although the variation in prevalence is within a narrow range, the differences
      are probably due to which definition of dyscalculia was used, the age the
      diagnosis was made and the instrument chosen to test for DC. The relative
      predominance of girls with DC may reflect a greater vulnerability to
      environmental influences alone or in addition to a biological predisposition. DC 
      is not only encountered as a specific learning disability but also in diverse
      neurological disorders, examples of which include ADHD, developmental language
      disorder, epilepsy, treated phenylketonuria and Fragile X syndrome. Although the 
      long-term prognosis of DC is as yet unknown, current data indicate that DC is a
      stable learning disability persisting, at least for the short term, in about half
      of affected children. The long-term consequences of DC and its impact on
      education, employment and psychological well-being have yet to be determined.

TI  - Mathematics and the brain: uncharted territory?
PG  - II2-10
AB  - The prevalence of disorders of arithmetic skills in children of circa 6 % calls
      for intensive consideration of the subject by health care providers and
      researchers. The necessity of interdisciplinary cooperation is evident. The
      current classifications by the ICD-10 (Specific disorder of arithmetic skills)
      and DSM-IV (Mathematics disorder) represent different viewpoints. A developmental
      dyscalculia is exclusively diagnosed according to clinical presentation.
      Arithmetic and its disorders are brain functions, determined and influenced by
      the (cerebral) human development. With modem neuroimaging techniques, a
      connectionistic model of distinct arithmetic functions has been specified. The
      results of single case descriptions of arithmetic disorders correspond well in
      that context with the concept of parallel cortico-subcortical and
      subcortico-cortical neuronal circuits. In comparison with dyslexia, there is
      intense need for research in the field of arithmetic disorders. Only through
      analysis and understanding of the complex cerebral connections in arithmetic can 
      improved diagnostic as well as multidimensionally therapeutic approaches to
      arithmetic disorders be achieved, possibly opening new ways of academic and
      social integration of the affected individuals.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: atypical cortical asymmetries and functional
      significance.
PG  - 35-46
AB  - Using brain magnetic resonance imaging, we measured in 16 young developmental
      dyslexic adults and 14 age-matched controls cortical asymmetries of posterior
      language-related areas, including Planum temporale and parietal operculum
      cortical ribbon, and of the inferior frontal region related in the left
      hemisphere to speech processing. In addition, we assessed the sulcal morphology
      of the inferior frontal gyrus in both groups according to a qualitative method.
      The dyslexic subjects also performed specific tasks exploring different aspects
      of phonological and lexical-semantic processes. Results showed that: (1) contrary
      to most results reported in the literature, there is a lack of any morphological 
      difference relative to Planum temporale asymmetry between the two groups; (2)
      there are significant differences between dyslexic and control subjects relative 
      to frontal areas; (3) concerning the parietal region, there is a more
      asymmetrical pattern towards the left side in dyslexic subjects than in controls;
      and (4) relations in dyslexic subjects between parietal asymmetry coefficient and
      the level of performance in a phonological task have a particular reliance on
      verbal short-term memory, frontal asymmetry and performance in a non-word reading
      task. Considering these results it is suggested that phonological segmentation
      skills may relate to frontal lobe morphology, while phonological memory-based
      impairment in people with dyslexia may rather relate to parietal lobe morphology.

TI  - Landau-Kleffner syndrome with onset at 18 months and an initial diagnosis of
      pervasive developmental disorder.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - We report one of the youngest and most intensively studied cases of
      Landau-Kleffner syndrome, with a follow-up of 5 years. The boy developed normally
      until the age of 18 months when he had two attacks, possibly epileptic.
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal. Over the next 5 months he lost his six to 
      ten words, did not engage with other children and became mute. When he was 34
      months old a child-psychiatrist suggested a diagnosis of pervasive developmental 
      disorder or developmental dysphasia. An EEG 3 months later showed abnormalities
      typical of Landau-Kleffner syndrome. His non-verbal abilities were normal as well
      as his neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A
      trial of clobazam and vigabatrin was unsuccessful. When he was 4 years and 9
      months old he was treated with corticosteroids and within 3 months his vocabulary
      increased from the standard for 1 1/2 years of age to that for 2 1/2 years of
      age. His language abilities continued to improve slowly until a stagnation period
      at the age of 6 years and 9 months. A second course of corticosteroids improved
      his comprehension and vocabulary to an almost normal level, and his EEG
      normalized. A total of 11 EEGs were obtained; all included sleep, but continuous 
      spike and wave during slow sleep was never documented. This report illustrates
      that Landau-Kleffner syndrome should be considered as an alternative diagnosis in
      children diagnosed with developmental dysphasia. An EEG including sleep should be
      considered, and in the presence of abnormalities a trial of anti-epileptic drugs 
      or corticosteroids should be undertaken.

PG  - 233-7
AB  - Using a new method based upon the measurement of four angles, we analyzed the
      corpus callosum of 23 adult male dyslexics and 25 age-matched controls on MRI
      sagittal scans. Two out of the four angles measured showed significant
      differences between the groups that are consistent with previous findings
      concerning the size of the corpus callosum in dyslexics. In particular, posterior
      regions are concerned, displaying a lowered corpus callosum in dyslexics. These
      findings are discussed in relation to cortical parietal asymmetries and possible 
      hormonal events, referring to the testosterone hypothesis, that could occur in
      utero or in the perinatal period in the dyslexic population.

PG  - 27-31
AB  - Here are present the data concerning the intellectual, language and frontal
      performances of 24 children who had undergone surgery because of cerebellar
      hemispheric or vermis tumors and one girl with viral cerebellitis. The children
      with right cerebellar tumors presented auditory sequential memory and language
      processing disturbances; those with left cerebellar tumors showed deficits in
      spatial tests and visual sequential memory. The girl with cerebellitis showed a
      complex neuropsychological picture with impairment in processing language and in 
      general sequential functions. Lesions of the vermis lead to two pictures: 1) a
      postsurgical mutism that could be subdivided into speech disorders (even to the
      extent of anarthria) and true language disturbances similar to frontal aphasia;
      and 2) behavioral disturbances ranging from irritability to a truly autistic
      response. These data seem to support the recently attributed role of the
      cerebellum as a modulator of the superior mental and social functions.

      personality organization. While dyslexia usually begins to manifest most clearly 
      in early latency when the challenge of learning to read is at its height, often
      the dyslexic child's ego development and functioning has already been adversely
      affected. The literature from neuropsychology suggests that dyslexia is a subtle 
      language-processing disorder that affects emotional, cognitive, and social
      development. The neuroanatomical literature also suggests a significant
      correlation between the neurodevelopmental basis for dyslexia, the caregiving
      environment, and psychological development. These two bodies of literature and
      analytic observations of a dyslexic patient suggest that the dyslexic individual 
      may have a neurological deficit that increases vulnerability to overstimulation. 
      The author hypothesizes that emotional and cognitive states result and reappear
      within the analytic encounter. This complicates clinical assessment and technical
      decisions. The author presents an analytic case and examines (1) the impact of
      deficit on the development of conflict; (2) the impact of the overwhelmed ego on 
      the mastery of developmental tasks; and (3) the impact of dyslexia on dysgnosia, 
      transference, and analytic process and technique.

AB  - In this, the 11th Annual Research Review, I have been pleased to work with an
      outstanding group of contributors. As in past issues of the Annual Research
      Review the aim is to provide our readers with reviews that update both current
      knowledge and research findings. Authors are asked to be selective, rather than
      comprehensive, in their coverage as they identify the issues that they feel are
      particularly important for future research. I am grateful not only to the authors
      but to the numerous referees who provided critiques of each paper. In the first
      paper in this issue David Skuse provides an update on the relevance of
      behavioural neuroscience to child psychopathology. This paper provides a
      thoughtful review of the findings of the past decade and outlines possible
      directions for future research developments; it appears that we are poised for a 
      major explosion of knowledge in this area. In the second paper Robin Chapman
      provides a very useful review of recent research on language development. This
      paper provides an update of Dorothy Bishop's earlier review of the topic and
      illustrates the considerable progress made since the time of that review. In the 
      third paper Eilish Gilvarry summarises recent research on substance abuse in
      young people. This review covers recent changes in trends and patterns of
      substance abuse, aspects of risk and comorbidity, and treatment. Brown and
      colleagues then review recent work on children and adolescents with HIV and AIDS;
      this global health problem presents unique issues relative both to research and
      intervention. Danya Glaser then provides an overview of recent work on child
      abuse and neglect and the brain; the attempt to bring the various perspectives of
      neuroscience together on this topic is particularly timely and appropriate.
      Finally, Sparrow and Davis provide an overview of recent advances in the
      assessment of intelligence. This paper provides a helpful summary of current
      perspectives on the assessment of intelligence; the review of instruments will be
      of particular interest to our readers. For the 12th edition of the Annual
      Research Review we anticipate coverage of the following topics:
      intersubjectivity, reading disability, longitudinal approaches to developmental
      data, mental retardation, conduct disorder, and psychopharmacology.

AB  - In this study, a reading-level-match design was used to test the hypothesis that 
      children with reading disability (RD) are characterized by poor phonological
      skills, and that a developmental lag, as opposed to a specific deficit, will be
      found in transparent orthographies. Spanish has a transparent orthography and
      thus children with RD should not show severe difficulties in the use of the
      phonological route, as in the English language. A sample of 118 participants was 
      selected and organized into three different groups: 40 with RD, 38 normal readers
      matched in age with the former, and 40 younger normal readers at the same reading
      level as those with RD. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects
      of lexicality, word frequency, word length, and positional frequency of syllables
      on lexical decision making and word-naming performance. While the participants
      were performing the naming task, we recorded what they read to subsequently
      analyze the form as well as the frequency of naming errors. The present study
      provides evidence for a deficit in phonological processing in a transparent
      orthography, particularly in nonword reading, because there were differences
      between the reading-level-matched groups.

TI  - Functional neuroimaging studies of reading and reading disability (developmental 
      dyslexia).
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Converging evidence from a number of neuroimaging studies, including our own,
      suggest that fluent word identification in reading is related to the functional
      integrity of two consolidated left hemisphere (LH) posterior systems: a dorsal
      (temporo-parietal) circuit and a ventral (occipito-temporal) circuit. This
      posterior system is functionally disrupted in developmental dyslexia. Reading
      disabled readers, relative to nonimpaired readers, demonstrate heightened
      reliance on both inferior frontal and right hemisphere posterior regions,
      presumably in compensation for the LH posterior difficulties. We propose a
      neurobiological account suggesting that for normally developing readers the
      dorsal circuit predominates at first, and is associated with analytic processing 
      necessary for learning to integrate orthographic features with phonological and
      lexical-semantic features of printed words. The ventral circuit constitutes a
      fast, late-developing, word identification system which underlies fluent word
      recognition in skilled readers.

TI  - Visual motion sensitivity in dyslexia: evidence for temporal and energy
      integration deficits.
PG  - 935-43
AB  - In addition to poor literacy skills, developmental dyslexia has been associated
      with multisensory deficits for dynamic stimulus detection. In vision these
      deficits have been suggested to result from impaired sensitivity of cells within 
      the retino-cortical magnocellular pathway and extrastriate areas in the dorsal
      stream to which they project. One consequence of such selectively reduced
      sensitivity is a difficulty in extracting motion coherence from dynamic noise, a 
      deficit associated with both developmental dyslexia and persons with
      extrastriate, dorsal stream lesions. However the precise nature of the
      mechanism(s) underlying these perceptual deficits in dyslexia remain unknown. In 
      this study, we obtained motion detection thresholds for 10 dyslexic and 10
      control adults while varying the spatial and temporal parameters of the random
      dot kinematogram (RDK) stimuli. In Experiment 1 stimulus duration was manipulated
      to test whether dyslexics are specifically impaired for detecting short duration,
      rather than longer stimuli. Dot density was varied in Experiment 2 to examine
      whether dyslexics' reduced motion sensitivity was affected by the amount of
      motion energy present in the RDKs. Dyslexics were consistently less sensitive to 
      coherent motion than controls in both experiments. Increasing stimulus duration
      did not improve dyslexics' performance, whereas increasing dot density did. Thus 
      increasing motion energy assisted the dyslexics, suggesting that their motion
      detectors have a lower signal to noise ratio, perhaps due to spatial
      undersampling.

TI  - Converging evidence for the role of occipital regions in orthographic processing:
      a case of developmental surface dyslexia.
PG  - 351-62
AB  - Recently, there have been several reports focusing on the neural basis for word
      recognition. Two different views have emerged: one emphasizing the role of the
      left angular gyrus in recognizing printed words, and the second view suggesting
      that visual word processing activates the left extrastriate cortex. This paper
      describes the case of EBON, a 14-year-old girl with an extensive early (most
      likely congenital) brain lesion in the left occipital lobe. She demonstrates a
      clear pattern of developmental surface dyslexia in that she is more successful at
      reading and spelling regular words than irregular words and makes frequent
      regularization errors. Thus, EBON is the first case reported with the potential
      to establish converging evidence for the role of extrastriate regions in the left
      hemisphere in the acquisition of orthographic representations.

TI  - The angular gyrus in developmental dyslexia: task-specific differences in
      functional connectivity within posterior cortex.
PG  - 51-6
AB  - Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies of developmental dyslexia reveals
      dysfunction at posterior brain regions centered in and around the angular gyrus
      in the left hemisphere. We examined functional connectivity (covariance) between 
      the angular gyrus and related occipital and temporal lobe sites, across a series 
      of print tasks that systematically varied demands on phonological assembly.
      Results indicate that for dyslexic readers a disruption in functional
      connectivity in the language-dominant left hemisphere is confined to those tasks 
      that make explicit demands on assembly. In contrast, on print tasks that do not
      require phonological assembly, functional connectivity is strong for both
      dyslexic and nonimpaired readers. The findings support the view that
      neurobiological anomalies in developmental dyslexia are largely confined to the
      phonological-processing domain. In addition, the findings suggest that
      right-hemisphere posterior regions serve a compensatory role in mediating
      phonological performance in dyslexic readers.

TI  - An open, nonrandomized clinical comparative study evaluating the effect of
      epilepsy on learning.
PG  - 795-800
AB  - Children with epilepsy, as a group, have a greater risk for developing learning
      problems as comorbid disorders. It is unknown which factors contribute to the
      development of such learning problems; therefore, our current knowledge does not 
      allow the prediction of educational delay in an individual child with epilepsy.
      This study aimed at excluding as many factors as possible that could interfere
      with the analysis of the impact of epilepsy on learning. From patients referred
      to us in 1997 (N = 123), children were included with mild global learning
      impairment, defined as educational delay between 6 months and 1 year and no other
      apparent reason for learning impairment except for epilepsy (ie, excluding
      children with dyslexia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or mental
      handicap). A total of 44 patients fulfilled this criterion: 31 also had epilepsy 
      (experimental group); the remaining 13 patients with similar mild learning
      impairment but without epilepsy were used as controls. In the experimental group 
      two subgroups were distinguished on the basis of onset of learning impairment: in
      group A (n = 17) the learning problems are not unexpected as they were preceded
      by mild developmental delay; in group B (n = 14) the problems are unexpected and 
      had a sudden onset. The two experimental groups differed from the control group
      on a number of variables, such as gender and the incidence of perinatal
      complications. More differences have been found between the two experimental
      groups: group B is selected from a larger group: all children with mild global
      learning impairment with sudden onset. In this group considerably more children
      with epilepsy have been found compared to the children with developmental delay; 
      moreover the epilepsy is more often characterized in these children as
      "unexpected," that is, there was no previous established diagnosis of epilepsy,
      the symptoms were mostly unclear and behavioral in make-up (attentional lapses,
      etc); the electroencephalogram plays a much greater role in the diagnosis in this
      group, especially in demonstrating seizures; finally, the children in this group 
      more frequently have neuropsychologic impairment. Children with epilepsy can have
      mild global learning difficulties, especially in the period after the onset of
      seizures. This group can be divided in a group with "trait-dependent learning
      difficulties," that is learning difficulties based on developmental delay, and a 
      group with "state-dependent learning difficulties." The focus in our study was on
      this latter group, consisting of children with sudden and unexpected decline of
      results in school. The crucial finding in this group is the relatively frequent
      demonstration of difficult-to-detect seizures, demonstrating that an uncontrolled
      epilepsy can cause a decline in school results even when the seizures are of
      short duration and have subtle symptoms.

TI  - [Intracranial arachnoidal cysts--localization, gender and sidedness].
PG  - 4162-4
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate whether data on location and
      distribution of intracranial cysts in a large patient population may explain why 
      and how such cysts are formed. We investigated 123 patients with 129 intracranial
      cysts, consecutively admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery in Bergen
      1988-97. Data were analyzed with regard to intracranial location and gender
      distribution. Cysts were much more commonly located in the temporal fossae than
      one would expect if the distribution were random; 68.1% of patients had temporal 
      cysts. We suggest a theory that may explain how mal-development of the
      leptomeninges may contribute to the formation of cysts, and why such cysts are
      more common in the temporal fossae. Temporal cysts were significantly more
      frequent in males than in females (3.9:1), while cysts of other locations did not
      show preponderance for a specific gender. New in this study is the interesting
      connection between gender distribution and sidedness: the significant
      predominance of left-sided temporal cysts was found only in males. In patients
      with a unilateral temporal cyst, the left/right ratio was 2.0:1 (males 44 left
      and 20 right, females eight left and six right). We discuss whether the
      preponderance of left-sided temporal cysts in males can be explained by a gender 
      specific developmental failure, as previously suggested for dyslexia.

TI  - Genomic mapping of chromosomal region 2p15-p21 (D2S378-D2S391): integration of
      Genemap'98 within a framework of yeast and bacterial artificial chromosomes.
PG  - 21-33
AB  - The region of chromosome 2 encompassed by the polymorphic markers D2S378
      (centromeric) and D2S391 (telomeric) spans an approximately 10-cM distance in
      cytogenetic bands 2p15-p21. This area is frequently involved in cytogenetic
      alterations in human cancers. It also harbors the genes for several genetic
      disorders, including Type I hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC),
      familial male precocious puberty (FMPP), Carney complex (CNC), Doyne's honeycomb 
      retinal dystrophy (DHRD), and one form of familial dyslexia (DYX-3). Only a
      handful of known genes have been mapped to 2p16. These include MSH2, which is
      responsible for HNPCC, FSHR, the gene responsible for FMPP, EFEMP-1, the gene
      mutated in DHRD, GTBP, a DNA repair gene, and SPTBN1, nonerythryocytic
      beta-spectrin. The genes for CNC and DYX-3 remain unknown, due to lack of a
      contig of this region and its underrepresentation in the existing maps. This
      report presents a yeast- and bacterial-artificial chromosome (YAC and BAC,
      respectively) resource for the construction of a sequence-ready map of 2p15-p21
      between the markers D2S378 and D2S391 at the centromeric and telomeric ends,
      respectively. The recently published Genemap'98 lists 146 expressed sequence tags
      (ESTs) in this region; we have used our YAC-BAC map to place each of these ESTs
      within a framework of 40 known and 3 newly cloned polymorphic markers and 37 new 
      sequence-tagged sites. This map provides an integration of genetic, radiation
      hybrid, and physical mapping information for the region corresponding to
      cytogenetic bands 2p15-p21 and is expected to facilitate the identification of
      disease genes from the area.

TI  - fMRI during word processing in dyslexic and normal reading children.
PG  - 3459-65
AB  - The present study addresses phonological processing in children with
      developmental dyslexia. Following the hypothesis of a core deficit of assembled
      phonology in dyslexia a set of hierarchically structured tasks was applied that
      specifically control for different kinds of phonological coding (assembled versus
      addressed phonological strategies). Seventeen developmental dyslexics and 17
      normal reading children were scanned during four different tasks: (1) passive
      viewing of letter strings (control condition), (2) passive reading of non-words, 
      (3) passive reading of legal words, and (4) a task requiring phonological
      transformation. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using statistical 
      parametric mapping (SPM96). Comparison of patterns of activation in dyslexic and 
      normal reading children revealed significant differences in Broca's area and the 
      left inferior temporal region for both, non-word reading and the phonological
      transformation task. The present data provide new evidence for alteration of the 
      phonological system in dyslexic children, and in particular, the system that
      mediates assembled phonological coding.

TI  - A functional lesion in developmental dyslexia: left angular gyral blood flow
      predicts severity.
PG  - 187-204
AB  - Functional imaging studies have shown reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
      in temporal and inferior parietal regions in dyslexia. To relate such
      abnormalities to the severity of dyslexia, correlations between reading skill and
      rCBF during a series of reading tasks and visual fixation were mapped for 17
      right-handed dyslexic men, ages 18-40, and 14 matched controls. These
      correlations uniquely identified the left angular gyrus as the most probable site
      of a functional lesion in dyslexia: Here, higher rCBF was associated with better 
      reading skill in controls (p <.01), but with worse reading skill in dyslexia (p
      <.01). This suggests that greater reliance on this region normally facilitates
      reading, but impairs reading in dyslexia. Thus, developmental dyslexia may share 
      a common localization with alexia.

TI  - Eye movement patterns in linguistic and non-linguistic tasks in developmental
      surface dyslexia.
PG  - 1407-20
AB  - Ten subjects who could be reliably assessed as surface dyslexics were selected on
      the basis of a large test battery. Eye movements in non-linguistic and linguistic
      tasks were studied in these subjects. Stability of fixation on a stationary
      stimulus was examined. Performance of dyslexics was no different from that of an 
      age-matched control group. Similarly, no difference was observed between the two 
      groups when they were requested to saccade to a rightward or leftward target. On 
      the other hand, while reading short passages, dyslexics showed an altered pattern
      of eye movements with more frequent and smaller rightward saccades as well as
      longer fixation times. The reading pattern was analysed by eye tracking. Numerous
      fixations were used to read a single word in a fragmented way. Longer words
      showed a higher number of fixations. Overall, it was concluded that surface
      dyslexia is not associated with oculo-motor dysfunction and the study of eye
      movements in reading reveals the processing through orthography-to-phonology
      conversion characteristic of surface dyslexia. The importance is stressed of
      examining selected groups of subjects in the psychophysiological study of
      dyslexia.

TI  - Commentary on Annett, Yeo et al., Klar, Saugstad and Orr: cerebral asymmetry,
      language and psychosis--the case for a Homo sapiens-specific sex-linked gene for 
      brain growth.
PG  - 219-31
AB  - Annett, Yeo et al. and Klar have each proposed theories that relate the genetics 
      of cerebral lateralization to predisposition to psychosis. These theories are
      considered in relation to the central paradox that psychosis is associated with a
      substantial biological disadvantage. Annett's heterozygote advantage hypothesis
      critically identified lateralization as a major determinant of ability, but it
      appears that what is inherited is degrees (as suggested by Yeo et al.) rather
      than (or as well as) direction of lateralization. Relative hand skill has been
      shown (Crow, T.J., Crow, L.R., Done, D.J., Leask, S.J., 1998. Relative hand skill
      predicts academic ability: global deficits at the point of hemispheric
      indecision. Neuropsychologia 36, 1275-1282.) to be a powerful predictor
      (interacting with sex) of academic ability but the greatest region of
      vulnerability (that includes reading disability and predisposition to psychosis) 
      is close to the point of equal hand skill ('hemispheric indecision'). In contrast
      with Annett's single locus, Yeo's polygenic and Klar's strand-segregation
      hypotheses, each of which postulates an autosomal locus or loci, the hypothesis
      of a single gene for asymmetry located in a sex-specific region of homology on
      both X and Y chromosomes can account for sex differences, as observed in age of
      onset, and premorbid precursors of psychosis, as well as differences in the
      general population in relation to degrees of hand skill, verbal ability and
      cerebral asymmetry. The evolutionarily recent transposition to, and subsequent
      paracentric inversion in, the Y chromosome short arm of a 4-Mb block from Xq21.3 
      (the proximal long arm of the X) are candidates for speciation events in the
      lineage that led to Homo sapiens. A gene associated with a range of variation
      (that may be due to a high mutation site, or perhaps to epigenetic modification) 
      on the Y that overlaps with, but differs quantitatively from, that on the X may
      explain the sex differences associated with psychosis, and may be relevant to its
      persistence. Such a gene could be the principal determinant in Man of the rate of
      brain growth, as suggested by Saugstad and by the findings of a recent study of
      adolescent onset psychosis (James, A., Crow, T.J., Renowden, S., Wardell, M.,
      Smith, D.M., Anslow, P., in press. Is the course of brain development in
      schizophrenia delayed? Evidence from onsets in adolescence. Schizophr. Res.).

TI  - A lack of cerebral lateralization in schizophrenia is within the normal variation
      in brain maturation but indicates late, slow maturation.
PG  - 183-96
AB  - The planum temporale (PT) bias, PT leftward, PT symmetry, and PT rightward
      reversal and sidedness preference, consistent right-handedness, ambilaterality,
      and consistent left-handedness are placed on a continuum mirroring the normal
      variation in rate of brain maturation. Maturational rate declines as we pass from
      PT leftward bias and consistent right-handedness to PT reversal and consistent
      left-handedness. Concomitantly, we expect an increased prevalence of males due to
      their pubertal age being about 2 years later than that of females, and a shift in
      cognitive profile from higher verbal scores than performance scores on the WAIS
      to higher performance than verbal scores. Three disorders fulfilling the criteria
      of late CNS maturation apart from the corresponding cognitive profile were
      studied: infantile autism (IA), schizophrenia (S), and developmental dyslexia
      (DD). These disorders have in common deficits in cognition, perception, and
      somatomotor function. The deficits range from an arrest in brain development
      (which is evident in infancy superimposed on late maturation in IA) to overall
      delayed brain and somatic development in S (culminating in postpubertal psychotic
      episodes and persistent and generalized residual deficits). Finally, reading
      inability, problems in perception (vision and hearing) and in motor coordination,
      particularly between the two hemispheres, characterize DD. Enhancing brain
      maturation and the prevalence of 'normal' cerebral asymmetry--laterality is
      preferable if we want to reduce the risk of developing the above-mentioned
      disorders. It is suggested that in the past environmental challenges have favored
      early maturation, with its abundant neuronal population, arborization and
      excessive density of synapses and cerebral excitability which has powered
      evolution through the mechanism of natural selection. Early maturation is
      obtainable through optimal nutrition, including a satisfactory amount of marine
      fat (PUFA), before and during pregnancy and later in life.

TI  - Explicit and implicit processing of words and pseudowords by adult developmental 
      dyslexics: A search for Wernicke's Wortschatz?
PG  - 1901-17
AB  - Two groups of male university students who had been diagnosed as dyslexic when
      younger, and two groups of control subjects of similar age and IQ to the
      dyslexics, were scanned whilst reading aloud and during a task where reading was 
      implicit. The dyslexics performed less well than their peers on a range of
      literacy tasks and were strikingly impaired on phonological tasks. In the reading
      aloud experiment, simple words and pseudowords were presented at a slow pace so
      that reading accuracy was equal for dyslexics and controls. Relative to rest,
      both normal and dyslexic groups activated the same peri- and extra-sylvian
      regions of the left hemisphere that are known to be involved in reading. However,
      the dyslexic readers showed less activation than controls in the left posterior
      inferior temporal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 37, or Wernicke's Wortschatz], left 
      cerebellum, left thalamus and medial extrastriate cortex. In the implicit reading
      experiment, word and pseudoword processing was contrasted to visually matched
      false fonts while subjects performed a feature detection paradigm. The dyslexic
      readers showed reduced activation in BA 37 relative to normals suggesting that
      this group difference, seen in both experiments, resides in highly automated
      aspects of the reading process. Since BA 37 has been implicated previously in
      modality-independent naming, the reduced activation may indicate a specific
      impairment in lexical retrieval. Interestingly, during the reading aloud
      experiment only, there was increased activation for the dyslexics relative to the
      controls in a pre-motor region of Broca's area (BA 6/44). We attribute this
      result to the enforced use of an effortful compensatory strategy involving
      sublexical assembly of articulatory routines. The results confirm previous
      findings that dyslexic readers process written stimuli atypically, based on
      abnormal functioning of the left hemisphere reading system. More specifically, we
      localize this deficit to the neural system underlying lexical retrieval.

TI  - Predictors of cognitive test patterns in autism families.
PG  - 1117-28
AB  - In a case-control study of cognitive performance, tests of intelligence, reading,
      spelling, and pragmatic language were administered to the parents and siblings of
      90 community-ascertained probands with autism (AU group) and to the parents and
      siblings of 40 similarly ascertained probands with trisomy 21 Down syndrome (DS
      group). The two samples were comparable for age and parents' education; both
      groups were well-educated and had above-average intelligence. AU parents scored
      slightly but significantly lower on the WAIS-R Full Scale and Performance IQ, on 
      two subtests (Picture Arrangement and Picture Completion), and on the Word Attack
      Test (reading nonsense words) from the Woodcock-Johnson battery. There were no
      differences between AU and DS siblings. As in earlier studies, AU parents, more
      often than DS parents, reported a history of early language-related cognitive
      difficulties; we were not able to replicate this in siblings. AU parents who
      reported such difficulties scored significantly lower on Verbal IQ, spelling, and
      the nonsense reading test. AU parents without a history of early language-related
      cognitive difficulties often had a Verbal IQ that exceeded Performance IQ by more
      than one standard deviation. AU siblings with early language-related difficulties
      had similar findings: lower Verbal IQ, poorer spelling, and poorer reading
      scores, compared to AU siblings without such a history. Parents with a positive
      history also scored worse on a measure of pragmatic language,the Pragmatic Rating
      Scale, but not on measures of social-related components of the broader autism
      phenotype. We propose that cognitive differences in a subset of autism family
      members are manifestations of the language-related component of the broader
      autism phenotype, and separate from the social-related component. This is
      consistent with the hypothesis that there are several genes that may interact to 
      cause autism which segregate independently and have distinguishable
      manifestations in family members. The hypothesis would be further supported by
      finding different patterns of genetic loci linked to autism in families where one
      or both parents has language difficulties.

TI  - Cerebellar hypoperfusion and developmental dysphasia in a male.
PG  - 745-8
AB  - A male with developmental dysphasia is documented with fine motor dysfunction
      whose improvement in expressive language was associated with increased cerebellar
      perfusion, as detected by serial N-isopropyl-p-[iodine-123] iodoamphetamine
      single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). His expressive language has
      been improving since 6 years, 8 months of age, and his verbal intelligence
      quotient improved from less than 45 at 5 years of age to 80 at 8 years of age.
      Compared with the SPECT findings at 4 years of age, the ratio of the average
      pixel values of the cerebellum to the frontal cortices increased at 9 years of
      age (from 0.81 to 1.03-1.09 in the hemisphere and from 0.66 to 0.98 in the
      vermis). However, he was not able to understand stories presented orally even at 
      9 years, 4 months of age. These results suggest that developmental dysphasia,
      which mostly involves expressive impairment, in this patient could have been the 
      result of delayed maturation of cerebellar function, mainly that of the vermis.

TI  - ERP differences among subtypes of pervasive developmental disorders.
PG  - 781-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with multiple complex developmental disorder (MCDD) have
      been distinguished from autistic children on the basis of chart reviews. It was
      questioned whether it is possible to find other, e.g., event-related potential
      (ERP), evidence for this assertion. METHODS: ERPs were measured in response to
      stimuli in a visual oddball task in autistic, MCDD, attention deficit disorder,
      dyslexic, and normal control children, to study whether ERP peaks can be used to 
      distinguish autistic and MCDD children, and to classify the aforementioned
      groups. RESULTS: It was found that the P3 at four different leads and the frontal
      Nc showed differences among the groups, and that the autistic and MCDD groups
      differed from each other as well as from the other groups. Also, it was found
      that, using discriminant analyses in which these parameters were included,
      children were classified above chance level. Especially in the MCDD group, a high
      percentage of correct classification was seen. CONCLUSIONS: ERP parameters
      indicate that autistic and MCDD children might differ in underlying pathology and
      might therefore, better be regarded as two separate diagnostic entities.

TI  - Brain morphometry in reading-disabled twins.
PG  - 723-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test for brain structure differences in reading disability (RD) by 
      means of MRI-based morphometry. BACKGROUND: Consensus is lacking on the brain
      structural correlates of RD. The current study reports on a wider set of
      structures in the largest sample yet studied, controlling for age, gender, IQ,
      and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: A case-control
      study was performed that was comprised of 75 individuals with RD (mean age,
      17.43+/-4.29 years) and 22 control subjects without RD (mean age, 18.69+/-3.75
      years), each a single member of a twin pair. The two groups were similar in age, 
      gender, and handedness, but differed in full-scale IQ (FSIQ), with the RD group
      having a lower mean FSIQ (101.8+/-9.9 versus 118.3+/-10.3). Using three
      group-by-structure analyses of covariance, groups were compared in terms of
      volume (in cubic centimeters) of major neocortical subdivisions, subcortical
      structures, and midsagittal areas (in square millimeters) of three subdivisions
      of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: Controlling for age, gender, and IQ, the authors
      found a significant group-by-structure interaction for the major neocortical
      subdivisions (p = 0.002), reflecting a different developmental pattern in the RD 
      group, with the insula and anterior superior neocortex being smaller and the
      retrocallosal cortex being larger in the RD group. In contrast, they found no
      group main or interaction effects for the subcortical or callosal structures. The
      pattern of results was essentially the same in subjects without ADHD.
      CONCLUSIONS: Most brain structures do not differ in size in RD, but cortical
      development is altered subtly. This study replicates in a larger sample previous 
      findings of insular differences in RD and demonstrates further that those
      differences are not attributable to comorbid ADHD.

TI  - A complex background in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders:
      developmental delay, dyslexia, heredity, slow cognitive processing and adverse
      social factors in a multifactorial entirety.
PG  - 225-36
AB  - A consecutive cohort of 112 children, 42 girls and 70 boys, aged 5-17 years,
      receiving child psychiatric inpatient care, was investigated regarding the
      probability of a complex background of concomitant biological and social factors.
      Most of the subjects showed maladjustment and depressive states, school problems,
      problems with peers, psychosomatic complaints and anxiety. A very high rate of
      factors indicating neurodevelopmental dysfunctions was found particularly in
      boys, who exhibited developmental delay, dyslexia, heredity for dyslexia, and a
      slow complex reaction time (CRT) - suggesting slow cognitive processing -
      considered an impairment in itself. Further, many children obtained errors on the
      CRT task, indicating attention deficit and deterioration during the test,
      pointing toward exhaustion. The social background displayed frequent problems
      such as broken homes, care outside the biological home, and disordered and/or
      abusing parents. The biological and social factors created a complex web,
      predisposing the child to primary, secondary and/or comorbidity problems, and
      leading to an interactive process reducing the child's psychosocial capacity and 
      competence. A pattern was developed of an impaired child, living in an
      inadequate/insufficient family milieu in a modern society, with increasing
      demands on children.

TI  - Reading and dual-task balancing: evidence against the automatization deficit
      explanation of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 473-8
AB  - Nicolson and Fawcett (1990) demonstrated specifically impaired balancing
      performance of children with dyslexia when balancing had to be done
      simultaneously with a secondary task. This finding was taken as evidence for a
      general automatization deficit of children with dyslexia. We attempted to
      replicate this finding with German children with dyslexia, whose characteristic
      reading difficulty is a fluency problem quite in correspondence with the
      automatization deficit explanation. Because we were concerned about a potential
      confound between dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we
      also collected teacher ratings on ADHD symptoms. We found that poor dual-task
      balancing was limited to children with higher ADHD ratings and that children with
      dyslexia without higher ADHD ratings performed as well on dual-task balancing as 
      age-matched control children. This finding supports the aforementioned confound. 
      Together with other findings from our research group, it supports the position
      that, even in consistent orthographies, difficulties in learning to read are
      caused by a specific phonological deficit.

TI  - A new gene (DYX3) for dyslexia is located on chromosome 2.
PG  - 664-9
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a specific reading disability affecting children and
      adults who otherwise possess normal intelligence, cognitive skills, and adequate 
      schooling. Difficulties in spelling and reading may persist through adult life.
      Possible localisations of genes for dyslexia have been reported on chromosomes 15
      (DYX1), 6p21.3-23 (DYX2), and 1p over the last 15 years. Only the localisation to
      6p21.3-23 has been clearly confirmed and a genome search has not previously been 
      carried out. We have investigated a large Norwegian family in which dyslexia is
      inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. A genome wide search for linkage with
      an average 20 cM marker density was initiated in 36 of the 80 family members. The
      linkage analysis was performed under three different diagnostic models. Linkage
      analysis in the family identified a region in 2p15-p16 which cosegregated with
      dyslexia. Maximum lod scores of 3.54, 2.92, and 4.32 for the three different
      diagnostic models were obtained. These results were confirmed by a non-parametric
      multipoint GENEHUNTER analysis in which the most likely placement of the gene was
      in a 4 cM interval between markers D2S2352 and D2S1337. Localisation of a gene
      for dyslexia to 2p15-16, together with the confirmed linkage to 6p21.3-23,
      constitute strong evidence for genetic heterogeneity in dyslexia. Since no gene
      for dyslexia has been isolated, little is known about the molecular processes
      involved. The isolation and molecular characterisation of this newly reported
      gene on chromosome 2 (DYX3) and DYX1 will thus provide new and exciting insights

TI  - Tactile perception in developmental dyslexia: a psychophysical study using
      gratings.
PG  - 1201-11
AB  - Multiple sensory abnormalities have been reported in individuals with
      developmental dyslexia, especially in the visual and auditory systems. We used
      gratings of alternating ridges and grooves to investigate tactile perception in
      this disorder using two tasks: spatial acuity-dependent discrimination of grating
      orientation and discrimination of gratings varying in ridge width. Compared to
      age-matched normal subjects, dyslexics were significantly impaired on grating
      orientation discrimination, with mean thresholds that were nearly twice normal.
      Unlike normal subjects, their performance on this task was slightly but
      significantly worse on the dominant hand than on the non-dominant hand. Dyslexics
      also showed a substantial but non-significant trend for impairment on grating
      ridge width discrimination. A group of subjects with attention deficit disorder
      did not differ significantly from normal on any of these measures. These findings
      expand the range of perceptual deficits reported in developmental dyslexia.
      Possible explanations for the results, including difficulties with temporal
      processing, abnormal lateral masking or parietal lobe dysfunction are discussed.

AB  - Neuropathological data in dyslexia has demonstrated alterations in the symmetry
      normally present in the planum temporale, as well as microdysgenesis in
      superficial cortical layers and disruption of the cytoarchitecture in subcortical
      structures. Neuroradiological and functional neuroimaging studies in dyslexia are
      consistent with localization of dysfunction to the temporoparietal junction.
      Present neuropathological and neuroimaging data support the concept that the
      fundamental problem in developmental dyslexia is a phonologic deficit. Present
      neuroimaging technology has increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of
      dyslexia. Functional neuroimaging may allow for the investigation of the effects 
      that treatment of dyslexia has on brain plasticity.

TI  - Hemispheric specialization using SPECT and stimulation tasks in children with
      dysphasia and dystrophia.
PG  - 512-20
AB  - Developmental dysphasia, a severe childhood learning disorder, is thought to
      result from problems in hemispheric specialization involving both left and right 
      cerebral hemispheres. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured at rest
      and during stimulation of both hemispheres independently: dichotic listening for 
      the left, dichaptic palpation for the right. Eight right-handed boys with
      expressive dysphasia, aged 8 to 12 years, were investigated using SPECT and
      compared with eight right-handed age-matched boys with Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy with reading disorders but normal speech. rCBF values at rest were also
      compared with those of five right-handed age-matched normal boys. In the dichotic
      task, children with dysphasia differed from children with dystrophia by failure
      to increase rCBF in the left hemisphere, in Broca's area, but rCBF increased in
      the right hemisphere, in the region homologous to Broca's area. In the dichaptic 
      task, rCBF increased bilaterally for children with dysphasia whereas in children 
      with dystrophia rCBF increased only in the right hemisphere. At rest the
      physiological asymmetry was reversed in favor of the right hemisphere in all
      areas except Broca's area. Surprisingly, the same applied at rest and for all
      areas in children with dystrophia. These results confirm that functional
      specialization of both hemispheres is impaired in developmental dysphasia.
      Moreover, they suggest that learning disabilities associated with Duchenne
      muscular dystrophy could also be related to abnormal hemispheric specialization.

PG  - 519-34
AB  - The present study was carried out on a sample of 125 right-handed boys who are
      described as follows: 50 boys with dyslexia, 50 controls of a similar age, and 25
      controls according to reading level. Using an objective procedure based on
      regression, we selected three subgroups from among the poor readers: children
      with difficulties in the lexical pathway (surface dyslexics), children with
      difficulties in the sublexical pathway (phonological dyslexics), and children
      with problems in both pathways (mixed dyslexics). When the performances of these 
      children on a dichotic listening task with CV syllables as stimuli were compared,
      it was found that although the children with dyslexia obtained lower
      lateralization indices than did the controls, the differences were only clearly
      significant when the most severe cases of phonological dyslexia were selected.

TI  - The relationship between language-processing and visual-processing deficits in
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 231-55
AB  - Some research on developmental dyslexia focuses on linguistic abnormalities such 
      as poor reading of nonwords or poor reading of exception words. Other research
      focuses on visual abnormalities such as poor performance on psychophysical tasks 
      believed to assess the functioning of the magnocellular and parvocellular layers 
      of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Little is known about what the
      relationships are between these two types of abnormalities. We measured nonword
      reading, exception word reading, and performance with Ternus apparent movement
      displays (the perception of which is believed to depend upon the magnocellular
      and parvocellular pathways) in dyslexic children and children without reading
      difficulties. Our results indicate that performance on the Ternus task is related
      to nonword reading ability but not to exception word reading ability. We offer
      two alternative interpretations of these findings. According to the first of
      these, nonword reading requires a serial left-to-right allocation of covert
      attention across the letter string being read and the neural systems involved in 
      this attentional process also play a part in responses to the Ternus display.
      According to the second, poor nonword reading and abnormal Ternus performance are
      not directly related: perinatal/neurodevelopmental insult has affected the LGN
      (influencing Ternus performance) and the adjacent medial geniculate nucleus (MGN;
      affecting phonological ability) and the MGN abnormalities may be more
      functionally related to poor nonword reading.

TI  - Verbal fluency in children: developmental issues and differential validity in
      distinguishing children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and two
      subtypes of dyslexia.
PG  - 433-43
AB  - Previous research studies have shown that in adults, verbal fluency is impaired
      after lesion to the frontal lobes and left temporal lobe. More recently, there
      have been a few studies reported which indicated that in children, like adults,
      left hemisphere and frontal lesions result in pronounced effects on verbal
      fluency. The present study examined developmental differences in verbal fluency
      within a sample of 130 normal children, aged 6 to 12 years. Additionally, the
      same verbal fluency test was administered to two subgroups of children with
      developmental dyslexia and a group of children with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
      revealed significant between-group differences by age in the normal children.
      Further, ANOVA demonstrated that the verbal fluency measure was clinically useful
      in differentiating the Language Disorder/Dysphonetic Dyslexic subgroup from the
      Visual-Spatial/Dyseidetic Dyslexic subgroup and the ADHD group, with the latter
      two groups performing within the average range.

TI  - Phonology, reading acquisition, and dyslexia: insights from connectionist models.
PG  - 491-528
AB  - The development of reading skill and bases of developmental dyslexia were
      explored using connectionist models. Four issues were examined: the acquisition
      of phonological knowledge prior to reading, how this knowledge facilitates
      learning to read, phonological and nonphonological bases of dyslexia, and effects
      of literacy on phonological representation. Compared with simple feedforward
      networks, representing phonological knowledge in an attractor network yielded
      improved learning and generalization. Phonological and surface forms of
      developmental dyslexia, which are usually attributed to impairments in distinct
      lexical and nonlexical processing "routes," were derived from different types of 
      damage to the network. The results provide a computationally explicit account of 
      many aspects of reading acquisition using connectionist principles.

AB  - Learning disabilities, intellectual retardation, dyslexia, attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and propensity to violence affect
      millions of U.S. citizens and are diagnosed in an estimated 3% of all children
      born in the United States. The consequences of these neurological, developmental,
      and behavioral disorders are often tragic; their familial, societal, and economic
      costs are immense, and the resulting disabilities lifelong. Toxic chemicals in
      the environment--lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, and certain
      pesticides--are now known to cause some fraction of neurodevelopmental
      disabilities. The implications of this discovery for prevention are potentially
      enormous; developmental disorders of toxic origin can, in theory, be prevented
      through the identification, characterization, and elimination of toxic
      environmental exposures. However, serious impediments to prevention exist: too
      few chemicals are tested for toxicity to early brain development, knowledge of
      infants' and children's special vulnerabilities and unique exposures is scant,
      and paradigms for environmental risk assessment have only begun to address the
      hazards confronting infants and children.

PG  - 277-89
AB  - The relation between severe developmental dysphasia and paroxystical anomalies
      was analyzed in 52 children, mean age 9 years (group I) suffering from
      developmental dysphasia, compared to a control group of 20 children, mean age 8
      years (group II). The children of both groups were selected excluding cases with 
      a prior history of epilepsy or neurological disease, and all had a cerebral MRI
      in the normal range. In group I, using the Rapin and Allen classification, we
      distinguished: 14 children with a syntactic-lexical syndrome and 34 children with
      a syntactic-phonological syndrome. Two children had verbal agnosia and two others
      verbal dyspraxia. The analysis of repeated standard EEGs showed: normal
      recordings in all the group II children and paroxystical anomalies in six of the 
      52 group I children. Night ambulatory sleep recordings showed such anomalies in
      18 of the 34 children with a syntactic-phonologic syndrome and in 6 of the 14
      children with a syntactic-lexical syndrome, but in only two of the 20 children of
      the control group. Paroxysmal abnormalities predominated in light sleep (stages I
      + II) and slow wave sleep (stages III + IV), but were rare in REM sleep. The
      abnormalities were diffuse or localized over the left frontotemporal area.
      Children with developmental dysphasia also showed an inconstant nocturnal sleep
      pattern with a higher incidence of awakenings during sleep significantly
      different from our group control. The relations between dysphasias,
      Landau-Kleffner syndrome, paroxystical anomalies, and sleep disorders are
      discussed and the results of genetic research concerning such population
      suffering from language disorders analyzed.

TI  - A neo-Lurian approach to assessment and remediation.
PG  - 107-16
AB  - The first part of this article presents an operational battery of tasks for
      measuring the four cognitive processes of Planning, Arousal-Attention, and
      Simultaneous and Successive processing (PASS) not only based on the qualitative
      data provided in Luria's syndrome analysis, but also taken from tasks in
      experimental cognitive psychology and neuropsychology. The second part of the
      article presents a remedial program based on PASS for enhancement of reading.
      Because this part provides in some detail the efficacy of the remedial procedure,
      it simultaneously validates the PASS constructs as well. In both parts of the
      article, I have been unmistakably guided by Luria's views: Tests are approaches
      to investigating cognitive functions, and the purpose of testing is to guide
      rehabilitation.

TI  - Auditory stream segregation in dyslexic adults.
PG  - 907-13
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is often associated with problems in phonological
      processing based on, or accompanied by, deficits in the perception of rapid
      auditory changes. Thirteen dyslexic adults and 18 control subjects were tested on
      sequences of alternating tones of high (1000 Hz) and low (400 Hz) pitch, which at
      short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) led to perceptual separation of the
      sound sequence into high- and low-pitched streams. The control subjects perceived
      the tone sequence as connected down to SOAs of 130 ms, with segregation of the
      streams at shorter SOAs; in dyslexic subjects the segregation occurred already at
      210 ms. Auditory stream segregation has previously been shown to impair the
      detection of phoneme order in segments of speech sounds. The observed aberrant
      segregation of sound streams in dyslexic subjects might thus contribute to their 
      difficulties in achieving awareness of phonemes or phoneme order and in the
      acquisition of literacy.

TI  - Reading skills in hyperlexia: a developmental perspective.
PG  - 338-55
AB  - Hyperlexia is characterized by advanced word-recognition skills in individuals
      who otherwise have pronounced cognitive, social, and linguistic handicaps.
      Language, word recognition, and reading-comprehension skills are reviewed to
      clarify the nature and core deficits associated with the disorder. It is
      concluded that hyperlexia should be viewed as part of the normal variation in
      reading skills, which are themselves associated with individual differences in
      phonological, orthographic, and semantic processing, short-term memory, and print
      exposure. A compulsive preoccupation with reading may also be crucial to the
      development of a hyperlexic reading profile. A theoretical framework, based on
      recent connectionist models of reading development, is described. This
      perspective provides a satisfactory account for how individual differences in a
      number of different skills can lead to a variety of manifestations of reading
      behavior, including hyperlexia.

TI  - Impaired visual search in dyslexia relates to the role of the magnocellular
      pathway in attention.
PG  - 1283-7
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that in a cluttered visual scene, the magnocellular (M) 
      pathway is crucial for focusing attention serially on the objects in the field.
      Since developmental dyslexia is commonly associated with an M pathway deficit, we
      compared reading impaired children and age-matched normal readers in a search
      task that required the detection of a target defined by the conjunction of two
      features, namely form and colour, that are processed by the parvocellular
      dominated ventral neocortical stream. The dyslexic group's performance was
      significantly poorer than the controls when there were a large number of
      distractor items. The scheme of selective attention proposed from these results
      provides a neural mechanism that underlies reading and explains the
      pathophysiology of dyslexia.

TI  - Cortical responses of infants with and without a genetic risk for dyslexia: II.
      Group effects.
PG  - 969-73
AB  - Infants born to families with a background of developmental dyslexia have an
      increased risk of becoming dyslexic. In our previous study no major group or
      stimulus effects in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of at-risk and control
      infants were found until the age of 6 months. However, in the current study, when
      we made the stimulus presentation rate slower, the ERPs to the short deviant /ka/
      were different from those to the long standard /kaa/ stimulus already in
      newborns. In addition, clear group differences in the ERPs were found. The
      results demonstrate that infants born with a high familial risk for dyslexia
      process speech/auditory stimulus durations differently from control infants at
      birth.

TI  - A case study of an English-Japanese bilingual with monolingual dyslexia.
PG  - 273-305
AB  - We report the case of AS, a 16 year-old English/Japanese bilingual boy, whose
      reading/writing difficulties are confined to English only. AS was born in Japan
      to a highly literate Australian father and English mother, and goes to a Japanese
      selective senior high school in Japan. His spoken language at home is English.
      AS's reading in logographic Japanese Kanji and syllabic Kana is equivalent to
      that of Japanese undergraduates or graduates. In contrast, his performance in
      various reading and writing tests in English as well as tasks involving
      phonological processing was very poor, even when compared to his Japanese
      contemporaries. Yet he has no problem with letter names or letter sounds, and his
      phoneme categorisation is well within the normal range of English native
      speakers. In order to account for our data that show a clear dissociation between
      AS's ability to read English and Japanese, we put forward the 'hypothesis of
      granularity and transparency'. It is postulated that any language where
      orthography-to-phonology mapping is transparent, or even opaque, or any language 
      whose orthographic unit representing sound is coarse (i.e. at a whole character
      or word level) should not produce a high incidence of developmental phonological 
      dyslexia.

TI  - [Dysphasia and dyslexia in the light of PASS theory].
PG  - 688-93
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The PASS theory of intelligence understands the cognitive function 
      as an information process or program that can be differentiated in planning,
      attention, successive and simultaneous. Every process is linked to an anatomical 
      region: planning to frontal cortex, attention to frontal cortex and subcortical
      structures, successive to frontal cortex and non-frontal cortex and simultaneous 
      to non-frontal cortex. Effective remediation is possible when a PASS pattern is
      known. OBJECTIVE: To verify whether dysphasia and dyslexia have a typical PASS
      pattern. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were divided in three groups
      comprising 12 children with dysphasia, 12 children with dyslexia and 10 children 
      with dysphasia and dyslexia, all of them between 6 years and 12 years of age, the
      majority boys. All children were administered the DN:CAS test to define the PASS 
      pattern. A control group with 45 normal children was used. RESULTS: Dysphasia
      shows poor successive and simultaneous process. Dyslexia shows poor successive
      process. The successive deficiency is poorer and in different way in dyslexia
      than in dysphasia which is inferable from comparative analysis between groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Dysphasia and dyslexia show a typical PASS pattern that allows an
      appropriate remedial training as a neurocognitive approach. The PASS diagnosis is
      a psychogenetic diagnosis which is different from the usual diagnosis based on
      semiology or results obtained with tests that explore non-PASS cognitive
      function.

TI  - Row blindness in Gestalt grouping and developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 385-93
AB  - A classic Gestalt figure is a 4 x 4 array of items grouped by similarity into
      either rows or columns. We found that some people do not see rows ("row
      blindness"). Furthermore, row blindness correlates with difficulties processing
      written language--more than half of the college-age dyslexics tested were row
      blind. Reading difficulties are probably not a cause of row blindness and forming
      rows by grouping is a part of reading, suggesting that row blindness might be one
      source of problems processing written language.

TI  - Severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery presenting as loss of
      consciousness due to the presence of a primitive hypoglossal artery: a case
      report.
PG  - 310-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of ischemic attacks in the internal carotid system usually
      involve focal cerebral dysfunction, i.e., hemiparesis or aphasia. However, an
      ischemic attack in the vertebrobasilar artery system usually presents with
      combined symptoms. The variety of manifestations included in the vertebrobasilar 
      profile makes the potential pattern of symptoms considerably more variable and
      complex than that in the carotid system. Manifestations can include syncope and
      also vertigo. METHOD AND RESULTS: A 42-year-old woman experienced frequent
      attacks of faintness with vertigo. Angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of
      the left internal carotid artery with a persistent primitive hypoglossal artery
      just distal to the stenosis. The right internal carotid artery was normal and
      cross circulation through the anterior communicating artery was not well
      developed. Both vertebral arteries were hypoplastic. The patient underwent
      carotid endarterectomy and, thereafter the episodes of syncope completely
      disappeared. CONCLUSION: It was supposed that global ischemia including the brain
      stem occurred because of stenosis of the left internal carotid artery
      attributable to the presence of a primitive hypoglossal artery.

TI  - Normal planum temporale asymmetry in dyslexics with a magnocellular pathway
      deficit.
PG  - 607-12
AB  - Developmental dyslexia has been associated with both abnormal hemispheric
      symmetry of the planum temporale (PT) and a deficit in the magnocellular visual
      pathway. We examined the relationship between these two abnormalities. Using
      sagittal magnetic resonance images and three methods, we measured the PT in
      dyslexic subjects with a documented magnocellular deficit and controls. Dyslexic 
      subjects did not deviate from normal leftward PT asymmetry, but both groups
      became less left-lateralized with methods that excluded sulcul tissue. Results
      suggest that dyslexic subjects with a magnocellular deficit do not always have
      abnormal symmetry of the PT. PT symmetry may instead be related to a different
      subtype of dyslexia. In addition, PT asymmetry in any subject group depends on
      the measurement method.

AB  - The benefit of genomics lies in the speeding up of research efforts in other
      fields of biology, including neurobiology. Through accelerated progress in
      positional cloning and genetic mapping, genomics has forced us to confront at a
      much faster pace the difficult problem of defining gene function. Elucidation of 
      the function of identified disease genes and other genes expressed in the Central
      nervous system has to await conceptual developments in other fields.

TI  - Language disorders in Landau-Kleffner syndrome.
PG  - 118-22
AB  - In the present long-term study, we analyzed language disorders in four patients
      with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Their common first symptoms were disability in
      understanding spoken words, followed by inarticulation and a decreased amount of 
      speech. All patients showed auditory verbal agnosia to some degree at some stage 
      of their illness. However, one patient showed typical sensory aphasia as the
      first symptom, and another patient showed nonverbal auditory agnosia followed by 
      pure word deafness. Thus, patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome show sequential 
      and sometimes hierarchical language disorders beginning with sensory aphasia,
      followed by auditory agnosia, and finally word deafness during their disease
      process. During long-term follow-up (20 to 30 years), all patients showed marked 
      recovery in language without any intellectual handicap, but with some disability 
      in spoken language, auditory verbal perception, and a discrepancy between
      Wechsler Verbal and Performance IQ scores.

TI  - Varieties of developmental reading disorder: genetic and environmental
      influences.
PG  - 73-94
AB  - There is widespread support for the notion that subgroups of dyslexics can be
      identified who differ in their reading profiles: Developmental phonological
      dyslexia is characterized by poor nonword reading, while developmental surface
      dyslexia is distinguished by a particular difficulty in reading irregular words. 
      However, there is much less agreement about how these subtypes, and particularly 
      the surface dyslexic pattern, are to be accounted for within theoretical models
      of the reading system. To assist in addressing this issue, the heritability of
      reading deficits in dyslexic subtypes was examined using a twin sample. Subjects'
      scores on (a) an exception word reading task and (b) a nonword reading task were 
      used to create a subtype dimension, and surface and phonological dyslexic
      subgroups were selected from the ends of this distribution. Reading deficits were
      found to be significantly heritable in both subgroups. However, the genetic
      contribution to the group reading deficit was much greater in the phonological
      dyslexics than in the surface dyslexics. The finding of differential genetic
      etiology across subtypes suggests that there is at least partial independence in 
      the development of the cognitive processes involved in reading exception words
      and nonwords. Also, the results support accounts of surface dyslexia which
      emphasize a strong environmental contribution.

TI  - [Language in autistic disorders].
PG  - S118-23
AB  - Autism is a developmental disorder affecting social relationships, communication 
      and flexibility of thought. These three basic aspects of autism may present in
      many different forms and degrees. Therefore autism should be considered to be a
      spectrum of autistic disorders rather than a single strictly defined condition.
      The spectrum of autistic disorders extends from intelligent individuals with
      acceptable social integration, to severely retarded patients with scarcely any
      social interaction. Language is almost always affected either in its formal
      aspects or in its usage. Autistic linguistic disorders form a specific language
      disorder (developmental dysphasia) and a pragmatic disorder linked both to the
      primary language problem and to the social cognitive deficit. We discuss the
      different linguistic syndromes observed in autistic patients with special
      emphasis on the semantic-pragmatic disorder.

PG  - S105-9
AB  - Studies of twins, familial aggregates and particular phenotypic conditions have
      shown an inherited basis for some dysphasias or specific developmental language
      impairments (SLI). This predisposition is usually multifactorial but the analysis
      of some families allows to postulate an autosomal dominant transmission of
      deficits in specific modular aspects of linguistic competences. Moreover,
      neuroimaging studies have shown modifications of normal volumetric
      interhemispheric asymmetries, and in group of SLI with receptive prominent
      disorder coexist epileptiform activity in wakefulness and non-REM sleep EEG; in
      some of these cases, antiepileptic drugs, specially steroids, can significantly
      ameliorate the language processing. As many patients with SLI have a difficulty
      for discrimination of subtle temporal indices, a hypothesis can also be made of a
      dysfunction in various subcortical structures (thalamus, basal ganglia,
      cerebellum) modulating the cerebral cortex in phonological processing.

TI  - [Neurocognitive and pharmacological approach to specific learning disorders].
PG  - S81-93
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Specific learning disorders are distinguished from general
      development disorders since, in general, only a certain number of processing
      mechanisms are involved whilst the remainder are unaffected. DEVELOPMENT: The
      classification proposed by the DSM-IV takes a step towards clinical understanding
      and use of a common nomenclature. However, neuropsychological assessment is
      essential to understanding clinical subtypes. The neuro-cognitive approach, when 
      taking into account the processing systems affected or involved, should include
      the strategies and principles of a cognitive-behavioural approach, accompanied by
      computerized cognitive training. Pharmacological treatment uses drugs with
      different modes of action depending on the specific neuropsychological
      characteristics of each type of disorder of nerve development. We discuss the
      clinical use of various drugs in view of investigations, present and past:
      methylphenidate for the dys-attentional subtype of ADHD; piracetam in
      developmental dyslexia of dysideatic type; citocolina in the infantile dysphasias
      of sensory input predominance, thiapride in dysfluencial and combined subtype of 
      ADHD; pipamperona in behaviour disorders and the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of
      ADHD, with or without associated and selegilina in the dysattention subtype of
      ADHD and the dysgraphias of the subtype with predominance of calligraphy and
      spatial disorders.

TI  - Spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity, coherent motion, and visible persistence in
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 651-68
AB  - Three experiments measured spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity, coherent motion,
      and visible persistence in a single group of children with developmental dyslexia
      and a matched control group. The findings were consistent with a transient
      channel disorder in the dyslexic group which showed a reduction in contrast
      sensitivity at low spatial frequencies, a significant reduction in sensitivity
      for coherent motion, and a significantly longer duration of visible persistence. 
      The results were also examined by classifying the dyslexic group into dyseidetic,
      dysphonetic, and mixed (dysphoneidetic) subgroups. There were no differences
      between the control and dyseidetic groups in contrast sensitivity, in coherent
      motion and in visible persistence. In comparison to the control group, the mixed 
      (dysphoneidetic) dyslexic subgroup was found to have a significant reduction in
      contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequencies, a significant reduction in
      sensitivity for coherent motion, and a significantly longer duration of visible
      persistence. In comparison to the control group, the dysphonetic group only
      showed a reduction in contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequencies.
      Comparisons between the dyseidetic, dysphonetic and mixed dyslexic subgroups
      showed that there were no substantive differences in contrast sensitivity,
      coherent motion, and visible persistence. The results support the proposal and
      findings by Borsting et al. (Borsting E, Ridder WH, Dudeck K, Kelley C, Matsui L,
      Motoyama J. Vis Res 1996;36:1047-1053) that a transient channel disorder may only
      be present in a dysphoneidetic dyslexic subgroup. Psychometric assessment
      revealed that all the children with dyslexia appear to have a concurrent disorder
      in phonological coding, temporal order processing, and short-term memory.

PG  - 104-6
AB  - A 42-year-old male presented with right-sided weakness, dysphasia and seizures
      while climbing the French Alps at an approximate altitude of 3,000 m. Imaging
      studies were consistent with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis with hemorrhage. 
      Laboratory testing for thrombophilic states, 18 days after presentation at our
      hospital, showed a low protein C level (0.32 U/ml, normal 0.80-1.60 U/ml). A
      family member was also found to have protein C deficiency without a history of
      thrombosis. The patient gradually improved and was discharged on warfarin and
      valproic acid. This is the first reported case of cerebral venous thrombosis in a
      patient with congenital protein C deficiency who ascended to high altitude. We
      postulate that the ascent to high altitude represented an additional
      prothrombotic risk factor to the congenital protein C deficiency leading to
      cerebral thrombosis.

TI  - A quantitative-trait locus on chromosome 6p influences different aspects of
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 146-56
AB  - Recent application of nonparametric-linkage analysis to reading disability has
      implicated a putative quantitative-trait locus (QTL) on the short arm of
      chromosome 6. In the present study, we use QTL methods to evaluate linkage to the
      6p25-21.3 region in a sample of 181 sib pairs from 82 nuclear families that were 
      selected on the basis of a dyslexic proband. We have assessed linkage directly
      for several quantitative measures that should correlate with different components
      of the phenotype, rather than using a single composite measure or employing
      categorical definitions of subtypes. Our measures include the traditional
      IQ/reading discrepancy score, as well as tests of word recognition,
      irregular-word reading, and nonword reading. Pointwise analysis by means of
      sib-pair trait differences suggests the presence, in 6p21.3, of a QTL influencing
      multiple components of dyslexia, in particular the reading of irregular words
      (P=.0016) and nonwords (P=.0024). A complementary statistical approach involving 
      estimation of variance components supports these findings (irregular words,
      P=.007; nonwords, P=.0004). Multipoint analyses place the QTL within the
      D6S422-D6S291 interval, with a peak around markers D6S276 and D6S105 consistently
      identified by approaches based on trait differences (irregular words, P=.00035;
      nonwords, P=.0035) and variance components (irregular words, P=.007; nonwords,
      P=.0038). Our findings indicate that the QTL affects both phonological and
      orthographic skills and is not specific to phoneme awareness, as has been
      previously suggested. Further studies will be necessary to obtain a more precise 
      localization of this QTL, which may lead to the isolation of one of the genes
      involved in developmental dyslexia.

AB  - The goal of this article is to inform and educate those who work with children
      who present with language-learning disorders about phonologic processing
      deficits, because this area has been shown to have a significant impact on
      children and adults who exhibit reading disabilities. Mental health professionals
      who work with children with reading problems need to be aware of what is known
      about this source of reading disorders and the implications of this knowledge for
      prevention and treatment. Advocating for appropriate instruction for children
      with reading problems is an important role mental health professionals can play
      in working with this population.

TI  - A genome-wide search strategy for identifying quantitative trait loci involved in
      reading and spelling disability (developmental dyslexia).
PG  - 47-51
AB  - Family and twin studies of developmental dyslexia have consistently shown that
      there is a significant heritable component for this disorder. However, any
      genetic basis for the trait is likely to be complex, involving reduced
      penetrance, phenocopy, heterogeneity and oligogenic inheritance. This complexity 
      results in reduced power for traditional parametric linkage analysis, where
      specification of the correct genetic model is important. One strategy is to focus
      on large multigenerational pedigrees with severe phenotypes and/or apparent
      simple Mendelian inheritance, as has been successfully demonstrated for speech
      and language impairment. This approach is limited by the scarcity of such
      families. An alternative which has recently become feasible due to the
      development of high-throughput genotyping techniques is the analysis of large
      numbers of sib-pairs using allele-sharing methodology. This paper outlines our
      strategy for conducting a systematic genome-wide search for genes involved in
      dyslexia in a large number of affected sib-pair familites from the UK. We use a
      series of psychometric tests to obtain different quantitative measures of reading
      deficit, which should correlate with different components of the dyslexia
      phenotype, such as phonological awareness and orthographic coding ability. This
      enable us to use QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping as a powerful tool for
      localising genes which may contribute to reading and spelling disability.

TI  - A candidate phenotype for familial dyslexia.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - The probative analysis of genotype-phenotype relations in familial dyslexia
      requires operationally defined psychobiological outcome variables that are not
      confounded by cultural differences of orthography or other factors that may
      influence the clinical ascertainment and diagnosis of dyslexia. Timing precision,
      as expressed in coordinated motor action, was used as an objective behavioral
      measure that can be mapped on current knowledge of central nervous system
      functions as well as on the most salient non-reading deficits in developmental
      dyslexia. Dyslexia families with four distinct pedigrees and a normally reading
      reference group were the study subjects. The results indicated that impaired
      timing precision in bimanual coordination and in motor speech were transmitted
      vertically in affected members of about half of dyslexia families. Motor
      coordination deficits were associated with a disposition to make dysphonemic
      spelling errors. It is proposed that impaired timing precision identifies a
      behavioral phenotype in some familial dyslexia subtypes. The detailed analysis of
      coarticulation in speech production may be one pathway by which impaired timing
      precision in motor action impinges on reading and writing deficits in
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Reading and spelling disorders: clinical features and causes.
PG  - 2-12
AB  - Developmental dyslexia (specific reading and specific spelling disorder) is
      thought to stem from specific features in cognitive processing strongly related
      to biological maturation of the central nervous system which interact with
      non-biological learning conditions. The specific learning disorder should not be 
      accounted for by mental age, gross neurological deficits, emotional disturbances 
      or inadequate schooling. As a clinical guideline, the child's level in reading
      and spelling must be significantly below that expected for the population of
      children of the same mental age. The persistence rate is high and dyslexia is
      often associated with psychiatric problems. The etiology is not known. From the
      biological point of view, dyslexia is supposed to have a neurological basis.
      Neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological correlates have been 
      studied by means of autopsy, brain imaging, neurophysiological and
      neuropsychological methods. There is good evidence that dyslexia is determined by
      heritable cognitive components of reading and spelling processing. Experimental
      research focuses on characteristics of brain structure and cognitive skills
      related to the central nervous systems of auditory-phonological and visual
      information processing.

AB  - The developmental disorders of childhood autistic, developmental language,
      reading (dyslexia), and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders-manifest with
      deficits in the traditional behavioral domains of cognition, language,
      visual-spatial function, attention, and socialization. However, none of these
      disorders has been associated with characteristic discrete focal lesions or
      recognized encephaloclastic processes. Developmental cognitive neuroscientists
      must therefore begin with the spectrum of sometimes divergent behaviors occurring
      within these disorders and work backward in an attempt to identify the
      responsible anomalous neural systems. Since the advent of "brain imaging" two
      decades ago, much effort has focused on identifying brain-behavior correlates in 
      these disorders. The results of these neuropathologic, structural, and functional
      neuroimaging studies are presented and the reasons for the often divergent
      findings are discussed. As we approach the end of the Decade of the Brain,
      current neuroimaging techniques give us the technology for the first time to
      apply a fundamental cognitive approach to brain-behavior relationships in the
      developmental disorders, to eliminate the conglomeration of "apples and camels"
      phenomenon. Researchers are working together to create comparable protocols and
      to adhere to methods that can be replicated across sites. The future prospects
      for a greater understanding of the developmental disorders are now much brighter 
      with neuroimaging technology.

PG  - 63-80
AB  - The [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) method for measuring brain metabolism has 
      not the wide clinical application that one might expect, partly because of its
      high cost and the complexity of the quantification procedure, but also because of
      reporting techniques based on region of interest (ROI) analysis, which are
      time-consuming and not fully objective. In this paper we report a clinical
      validation of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) using rCMRglc (quantitative)
      and radioactivity distribution (nonquantitative) [18F]FDG PET data. We show that 
      a 10-min noninteractive voxel-based SPM analysis on a standard workstation
      enables objective assessment, including localization in stereotactic space, of
      regional glucose consumption abnormalities, whose reliability can be assessed on 
      statistical and clinical grounds. Clinical validity was established using a small
      series of patients with degenerative or developmental disorders, including
      probable Alzheimer's disease, progressive aphasia, multiple sclerosis,
      developmental specific language impairment, and epilepsy. Analysis of
      quantitative and nonquantitative data showed the same pattern of results,
      suggesting that, for clinical purposes, quantitation and invasive arterial
      cannulation can be avoided. This should facilitate a wider application of the
      technique and the extension of SPM clinical analysis to H215O PET or high
      resolution SPECT perfusion studies.

AB  - Anomalies in the laterality of numerous neurocognitive dimensions associated with
      schizophrenia have been documented, but their role in the etiology and early
      development of the disorder remain unclear. In the study of normative
      neurobehavioral organization, animal models have shed much light on the
      mechanisms underlying and the factors affecting adult patterns of both functional
      and structural asymmetry. Nonhuman species have more recently been used to
      investigate the environmental, genetic, and neuroendocrine factors associated
      with developmental language disorders in humans. We propose that the animal
      models used to study the basis of lateralization in normative development and
      language disorders such as dyslexia could be modified to investigate lateralized 
      phenomena in schizophrenia.

AB  - Developmental language disorders exist in 5% to 10% of preschoolers and have
      strong genetic implications. There are several variants of dysphasia: mixed
      receptive/expressive, expressive, or higher order language processing. Preschool 
      children with pervasive developmental disorders are dysphasic as well as
      autistic. Some undergo a language and behavioral regression, most often as
      toddlers. The role of subclinical epilepsy in this regression is unknown because 
      it is often ignored. Most dysphasic children speak by schoolage but are at
      substantial risk for reading/academic difficulty. Powerful new techniques to
      image the brain during language have no place in the routine workshop of children
      with dysphasia with or without autism.

PG  - 369-83
AB  - The ability to read and the phonological fitness of 89 youth (average age of 21.3
      years) having difficulty with social and professional integration were examined. 
      We observed that 64% of them (n = 57) had difficulty in reading. The results of
      the phonological and reading tests showed that developmental dyslexia
      constitutes, for 56% of the subjects (n = 32), or for 36% of the population of
      youth with difficulties, the explanatory framework for the delay of acquisition
      of these capacities. Reading difficulties for these youth were significantly
      linked to an alteration of the phonological treatment that effects: short-term
      verbal memory, auditory discrimination and meta-phonological fitness. The data
      tends to validate the hypothesis of the existence of a functional link between
      developmental dyslexia and illiteracy.

PG  - 2445-7
AB  - Genetic studies recently reported linkages between two chromosomal regions and
      two phenotypes of dyslexia. These findings should not be taken to mean that the
      gene for dyslexia has been discovered. It is argued that a gene for dyslexia is
      improbable. The difficulty in learning to read is of a multidimensional nature,
      of which the features are not yet unequivocally known. Deficits and strategies of
      the child learning to read still have to be disentangled and environmental as
      well as biological variables define the condition. Furthermore, as reading is a
      rather novel acquisition of mankind, an evolutionary explanation seems rather
      questionable.

AB  - Learning disabilities are common conditions in pediatric patients. The etiology

      abnormalities of brain structure and function. Early recognition and referral to 
      qualified educational professionals is critical for the best possible outcome.
      Visual problems are rarely responsible for learning difficulties. No scientific
      evidence exists for the efficacy of eye exercises ("vision therapy") or the use
      of special tinted lenses in the remediation of these complex pediatric
      developmental and neurologic conditions.

TI  - Paradoxically greater interhemispheric transfer deficits in partial than complete
      callosal agenesis.
PG  - 1015-24
AB  - Symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection are typically much less severe in
      callosal agenesis than after surgical section of the corpus callosum. Sperry
      [Sperry, R. W., Plasticity of neural maturation. Developmental Biology, 1968, 2
      (Suppl.), 306-327.] has attributed this difference to two interconnected factors:
      (1) the callosal section is usually performed after the brain has lost the
      maximal degree of functional plasticity associated with the early stages of
      development and (2) the removal of an already formed structure is more disruptive
      for functional brain organization than the failure of the same structure to
      develop. It has been suggested that functional compensation is less efficient if 
      callosal agenesis is partial rather than complete [Dennis, M., Impaired sensory
      and motor differentiation with corpus callosum agenesis: A lack of callosal
      inhibition during ontogeny? Neuropsychologia, 1976, 14, 455-469.]. This
      suggestion is supported by the present findings of partial left-hand anomia,
      partial left-field alexia and poor tactile cross-localization in a subject with a
      congenital absence of the posterior part of the corpus callosum due to an
      arteriovenous malformation. In agreement with many previous studies, similar,
      though more severe, symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection were found in a
      subject with a complete section of the corpus callosum, but not in a subject with
      complete callosal agenesis. Praxic control of the left hand on verbal commands
      was severely deficient in the callosotomy subject, but it was normal in the
      subject with callosal hypogenesis. The lesser degree of compensation in partial
      compared to complete callosal agenesis may be explained by a reduced pressure to 
      develop extracallosal means of interhemispheric communication, contingent on the 
      partial existence of callosal connections, as well as by the later occurrence in 
      development of the causes of callosal hypogenesis compared to those of total
      callosal agenesis.

TI  - Dichotic pitch: a new stimulus distinguishes normal and dyslexic auditory
      function.
PG  - 3001-5
AB  - Two patterns of appropriately filtered acoustic white noise can be binaurally
      fused by the human auditory system to extract pitch and location information that
      is not available to either ear alone. This phenomenon is called dichotic pitch.
      Here we present a new method for generating more effective and useful dichotic
      pitch stimuli. These novel stimuli allow the psychophysical assessment of
      dichotic pitch detection thresholds. We show that dichotic pitch detection is
      significantly impaired in individuals with developmental dyslexia, as compared to
      average readers. These results suggest a low-level auditory deficit associated
      with dyslexia and also demonstrate the potential value of our new dichotic pitch 
      stimuli for assessment of auditory processing.

TI  - Sleep EEG and developmental dysphasia.
PG  - 595-9
AB  - To determine the relation between developmental dysphasia and EEG anomalies
      during sleep, we compared 52 subjects with dysphasia with a control group of 20
      children by using the ambulatory EEG method. Whereas 50% of the children with
      dysphasia experienced paroxysmal activity (PA), only two of the control group
      did. It is likely that paroxysmal abnormalities and language impairment are
      related to architectural dysplasia and neuron-migration disturbances. PA is
      frequent in subjects with receptive developmental dysphasia and may be the cause 
      of language deterioration. When the occurrence of paroxysmal abnormalities during
      sleep is higher than 8% of total sleep time, we suggest the use of antiepileptic 
      drugs.

TI  - Cerebellar contribution to linguistic processing efficiency revealed by focal
      damage.
PG  - 491-501
AB  - The cerebellum's role in cognitive skills was examined in a child (L.C.) with
      focal injury to the left cerebellum. Initial symptoms included aphasia and
      dysarthria. At 3 and 9 months post-injury, clinical neuropsychological tests
      revealed persistent psychomotor slowing as well as deficits in executive
      functions. Further cognitive testing at 13 and 16 months post-injury demonstrated
      that L.C. processed information from both the linguistic and nonlinguistic
      domains more slowly than age-, grade- and sex-matched controls. Notably, her
      linguistic processing was more than twice as slow as that of her peers, whereas
      her nonlinguistic processing was only approximately 20% slower. Within each
      domain the degree of cognitive slowing was approximately the same across diverse 
      tasks. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a cerebellar
      contribution to cognitive processing, particularly the processing of linguistic
      information.

      prospective follow-up study.
PG  - 358-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the natural history of developmental dyscalculia (DC), a
      specific learning disability affecting approximately 5% of the normal school age 
      population and to identify factors that contribute to persistence. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Of a cohort of 3029 fourth-grade students, 185 children were classified as having
      DC; 140 participated in phase 1 in which they underwent IQ testing; arithmetic,
      reading, and writing evaluations; and an assessment for
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder over a 3-year period. Three years later 
      (phase 2), 88% of the children (123 of 140) were retested. RESULTS: The
      arithmetic scores of 95% of the 123 children with DC fell within the lowest
      quartile for their class. At phase 2, 47% (57 of 123) of the children were
      reclassified as having persistent DC, scoring in the lowest 5% for their age
      group (13 to 14 years old). Factors significantly associated with persistence of 
      DC in a multivariate model were severity of the arithmetic disorder and
      arithmetic problems in siblings of the probands. Factors that were not associated
      with persistence included socioeconomic status, gender, the presence of another
      learning disability, and educational interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of
      DC is similar to that of other learning disabilities, with a persisting course in
      almost half of affected children; the remainder continue to perform poorly in
      arithmetic. The ultimate outcome of children with dyscalculia and the effect on
      education, employment, and psychologic well-being have yet to be determined.

TI  - Vergence control across saccades in dyslexic adults.
PG  - 452-62
AB  - Many aspects of vision have been investigated in developmental dyslexia. Some
      research suggests deficits in vergence control (e.g. Buzzelli, 1991, Optom.
      Vision Sci. 68, 842-846), although ability to control vergence across saccades
      has not yet been investigated. We have explored this question indirectly using
      Enright's (1996 Vision Res. 36, 307-312.) sequential stereopsis task. The task
      requires observers to set two adjacent targets (whose textures cannot be resolved
      simultaneously if either is fixated) to appear equi-distant. Enright has argued
      that sequential stereopsis stereoacuity thresholds offer an indication of
      vergence control across saccades. We report two experiments using a total of 17
      dyslexic and 18 control adults. Performance was measured on a sequential
      stereopsis task and an ordinary 'simultaneous' stereopsis task. No significant
      differences between groups were found. However, whereas practice of the
      sequential task lowered control group thresholds on the simultaneous task, for
      the dyslexic group it significantly raised thresholds, suggesting that visual
      fatigue is especially important in investigations of visual functions in
      dyslexia. Although the small samples used limit conclusions at this stage, the
      main sequential stereopsis results suggest that, if Enright is correct, dyslexic 
      adults can show normal vergence control across saccades.

TI  - A multimodal language region in the ventral visual pathway.
PG  - 274-7
AB  - Reading words and naming pictures involves the association of visual stimuli with
      phonological and semantic knowledge. Damage to a region of the brain in the left 
      basal posterior temporal lobe (BA37), which is strategically situated between the
      visual cortex and the more anterior temporal cortex, leads to reading and naming 
      deficits. Additional evidence implicating this region in linguistic processing
      comes from functional neuroimaging studies of reading in normal subjects and
      subjects with developmental dyslexia. Here we test whether the visual component
      of reading is essential for activation of BA37 by comparing cortical activations 
      elicited by word processing in congenitally blind, late-blind and sighted
      subjects using functional neuroimaging. Despite the different modalities used
      (visual and tactile), all groups of subjects showed a common activation of BA37
      by words relative to non-word letter-strings. These findings agree with the
      proposal that BA37 is an association area that integrates converging inputs from 
      many regions. Our study confirms a prediction of theories of brain function that 
      depend on convergence zones; the absence of one input (that is, visual) does not 
      alter the response properties of such a convergence region.

TI  - Sensitivity to dynamic auditory and visual stimuli predicts nonword reading
      ability in both dyslexic and normal readers.
PG  - 791-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental dyslexia is a specific disorder of reading and spelling
      that affects 3-9% of school-age children and adults. Contrary to the view that it
      results solely from deficits in processes specific to linguistic analysis,
      current research has shown that deficits in more basic auditory or visual skills 
      may contribute to the reading difficulties of dyslexic individuals. These might
      also have a crucial role in the development of normal reading skills. Evidence
      for visual deficits in dyslexia is usually found only with dynamic and not static
      stimuli, implicating the magnocellular pathway or dorsal visual stream as the
      cellular locus responsible. Studies of such a dissociation between the processing
      of dynamic and static auditory stimuli have not been reported previously.
      RESULTS: We show that dyslexic individuals are less sensitive both to particular 
      rates of auditory frequency modulation (2 Hz and 40 Hz but not 240 Hz) and to
      dynamic visual-motion stimuli. There were high correlations, for both dyslexic
      and normal readers, between their sensitivity to the dynamic auditory and visual 
      stimuli. Nonword reading, a measure of phonological awareness believed crucial to
      reading development, was also found to be related to these sensory measures.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results further implicate neuronal mechanisms that are
      specialised for detecting stimulus timing and change as being dysfunctional in
      many dyslexic individuals. The dissociation observed in the performance of
      dyslexic individuals on different auditory tasks suggests a sub-modality division
      similar to that already described in the visual system. These dynamic tests may
      provide a non-linguistic means of identifying children at risk of reading
      failure.

TI  - Metabolic abnormalities in developmental dyslexia detected by 1H magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy.
PG  - 1849-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurological and physiological deficits have been reported in the
      brain in developmental dyslexia. The temporoparietal cortex has been directly
      implicated in dyslexic dysfunction, and substantial indirect evidence suggests
      that the cerebellum is also implicated. We wanted to find out whether the
      neurological and physiological deficits manifested as biochemical changes in the 
      brain. METHODS: We obtained localised proton magnetic resonance spectra
      bilaterally from the temporo-parietal cortex and cerebellum of 14 well-defined
      dyslexic men and 15 control men of similar age. FINDINGS: We found biochemical
      differences between dyslexic men and controls in the left temporo-parietal lobe
      (ratio of choline-containing compounds [Cho] to N-acetylaspartate [NA] p< or
      =0.01) and right cerebellum (Cho/NA, p< or = 0.01; creatine [Cre] to NA p< or
      =0.05; (not significant). We found lateral biochemical differences in dyslexic
      men in both these brain regions (Cho/NA in temporo-parietal lobe, left vs right, 
      p< or =0.01; Cre/NA in cerebellum, left vs right, p< or =0.001). We found no such
      lateral differences in controls. There was no significant relation between the
      degree of contralateral chemical difference and handedness in dyslexic or control
      men. INTERPRETATION: We suggest that the observed differences reflect changes in 
      cell density in the temporo-parietal lobe in developmental dyslexia and that the 
      altered cerebral structural symmetry in dyslexia is associated with abnormal
      development of cells or intracellular connections or both. The cerebellum is
      biochemically asymmetric in dyslexic men, indicating altered development of this 
      organ. These differences provide direct evidence of the involvement of the
      cerebellum in dyslexic dysfunction.

TI  - A twin and family study of the association between immune system dysfunction and 
      dyslexia using blood serum immunoassay and survey data.
PG  - 310-33
AB  - We conducted a study of the association between developmental reading disability 
      (DRD) and immune disorders (ID) using both survey and immunoassay data in two
      separate samples of families. One sample was made up of twins and their parents
      and was ascertained through a population-based sampling scheme. The other sample 
      was a set of extended pedigrees selected for apparent autosomal dominant
      transmission of DRD. We failed to find an association between DRD and ID in
      either sample, regardless of the method used to assess immune system function.
      Even though our twin sample provided evidence that both DRD and immune conditions
      were significantly heritable, there was no evidence for a genetic correlation
      between ID and DRD nor was there any clear indication that a special subgroup of 
      individuals may be comorbid for these conditions because of genetic reasons. How 
      these negative findings can be reconciled with the developmental hypothesis of
      Geschwind, Behan, Galaburda, and colleagues, and how they may relate to the gene 
      locus influencing DRD that has been recently located in the HLA region of the
      short arm of chromosome 6 is discussed.

TI  - Molecular approaches to child psychopathology.
PG  - 413-32
AB  - Basic research into the genetics of childhood psychiatric disorders has
      substantially increased during the last two decades. Specific genetic mutations
      have been characterized in some developmental disorders (e.g., fragile X syndrome
      and Prader-Willi syndrome), but thus far identification of etiological gene
      mutations in psychiatric illnesses has been unsuccessful. Several psychiatric
      disorders serve as examples of the current state of molecular approaches in child
      psychopathology. Investigations to date of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS)
      have not resulted in the discovery of a gene of major effect. Some studies have
      implicated the D2 and D4 dopamine receptors as having a direct role in the
      etiology of GTS, but other studies have disputed those findings. However, the
      dopamine D2 receptor may modulate the severity of GTS. Obsessive-compulsive
      disorder has a reported association with a low-activity allele of the enzyme
      catechol-O-methyltransferase; however, the low-activity genotype is also seen in 
      a significant proportion of unaffected individuals. For reading disability two
      distinct phenotypes (phonological awareness and single-word reading) have been
      linked to separate loci on chromosomes 6 and 15. Attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD) has a reported association with the dopamine transporter.
      Findings of a genetic locus for the personality trait of novelty seeking remain
      controversial.

TI  - Abnormal frequency mismatch negativity in mentally retarded children and in
      children with developmental dysphasia.
PG  - 178-83
AB  - The auditory event-related potential waveform termed "mismatch negativity" was
      examined in 12 mentally retarded children with delayed development of speech and 
      language (aged 5-8 years) and in 13 children with developmental dysphasia (aged
      5-9 years). The mismatch negativity waves were elicited with pure sine-wave tone 
      stimuli using the oddball paradigm. We measured the peak latency and peak
      amplitude of mismatch negativity responses to frequency (500/553 Hz) difference. 
      The mismatch negativity patterns were compared with those of 10 children with
      normal development of linguistic skills (aged 5-9 years). In both the mentally
      retarded and dysphasic groups, the peak amplitude of the frequency mismatch
      negativity was significantly attenuated when compared with the control group, but
      no significant difference was observed between the mentally retarded and
      dysphasic groups. Attenuated frequency mismatch negativity was related to
      impairment of linguistic skills irrespective of the child's cognitive skills.
      Because the mismatch negativity response reflects central auditory processing and
      is modal specific for auditory stimuli, this change-specific response can serve
      as an objective tool to elucidate central auditory deficits in children.

TI  - Abnormal callosal morphology in male adult dyslexics: relationships to handedness
      and phonological abilities.
PG  - 127-46
AB  - The classical notion that developmental dyslexia may somehow relate to impaired
      communication between hemispheres has not yet received convincing support.
      Sixteen dyslexic adults and 12 controls received a high resolution brain MRI scan
      for morphometric study of the corpus callosum. Automatized measurements of
      callosal area and calculation of indices defining the general morphology of the
      callosal mid-surface were performed. Each participant received global
      intelligence and reading achievement evaluation; dyslexics were further proposed 
      specific neuropsychological tests specially designed to explore the mechanisms of
      reading impairment. It just appears from the group comparisons (1) that the
      dyslexics' corpus callosum displays a more circular and evenly thicker general
      shape, and (2) that the midsagittal surface is on the average larger than in
      controls, in particular in the isthmus. Moreover, the different morphometric
      characteristics of the dyslexic brain correlated with the degree of impairment on
      various tests exploring phonological abilities. In vivo morphometry of the corpus
      callosum may provide valuable hints for understanding developmental learning
      disorders and their consequences in adults.

TI  - Reading ability and processing in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular
      atrophy.
PG  - 12-20
AB  - We analysed the reading abilities and processing of 21 children with Duchenne
      muscular dystrophy (DMD), 11 matched children suffering from spinal muscular
      atrophy (SMA) and 42 children receiving normal education. The principal result
      observed was that the DMD children exhibited a reading age which was
      significantly lower than the SMA children compared with their chronological age. 
      These learning disabilities were not related to a deficit in non-verbal
      performance intelligence, but psycholinguistic evaluation showed a deficit in
      verbal intelligence, especially in the Similarities and Arithmetic WISC-R
      subtests, in phonological abilities, oral word repetition, and in digit span
      score. The results for the DMD children were heterogeneous, and ranged from
      normal to greater or lesser involvement. In an attempt to clarify the nature of
      this reading impairment in DMD children, the three groups (DMD, SMA, and normal
      control children) were tested by reading aloud a list of single words and
      non-words. The DMD children were significantly impaired in reading non-words,
      suggesting reading disability similar to dysphonetic dyslexia, the most frequent 
      subtype of developmental dyslexia. These results are discussed in the light of
      psychometric data available for our DMD population and in the light of previous
      studies. The practical consequences of diagnosis on rehabilitation are very
      important. The precise description of the cognitive deficits seen in DMD is of
      value for future clinical and genetic studies.

TI  - Cerebral lateralisation and rate of maturation.
PG  - 37-62
AB  - Multifactorial inheritance applied to brain development implies a large continuum
      of normal variation with deviation from the norm at the extremes of maturational 
      rate. The greater population of neurons, greater arborization of neural networks 
      and excessive synaptic density in early maturation imply that adaptability
      (plasticity) is a main advantage, as opposed to a deficit in adaptability
      associated with the reduced number of neurons, reduced connectivity and reduced
      synaptic density in late slow maturation. It is hypothesised that Planum
      Temporale (PT) asymmetry and hand-preference predict the rate of CNS maturation
      as does the cognitive profile on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS): PT
      leftward asymmetry, right-handedness and a left-hemisphere cognitive advantage
      signifies early fast maturation: PT rightward asymmetry, left-handedness and a
      right-hemisphere cognitive advantage signify late maturation, while PT symmetry
      and ambilaterality represent rates of maturation in between. The slower
      development of males implies a male predominance in disorders affecting late
      maturers: Developmental Dyslexia (DD) with a predominance of rightward PT
      asymmetry/symmetry, left-handedness and multiple functional deficits, as well as 
      excessive regressive events confirmed on PT/MRI. Schizophrenia, hypothesised to
      be a disorder in late maturers, is distinguished by rightward asymmetry/symmetry.
      Left-handedness and DD are common as is prior delayed development supporting
      excessive regressive events as do the findings on PT/MRI. To reduce the risk of
      DD and schizophrenia requires a reduction in late maturation through the
      enhancement of maturational rate by optimal nutrition before and during pregnancy
      and later.

TI  - Development of a magnocellular function in good and poor primary school-age
      readers.
PG  - 62-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal functioning of the transient visual pathway (the M-pathway) 
      has been implicated in specific reading disability (SRD). The aim of this study
      is to examine the contrast thresholds for flicker-defined form discrimination in 
      primary school children, and to compare its development with reading and
      mentation development as a means of identifying children at risk of SRD. METHODS:
      One hundred eighty-seven children (aged 4 to 13 years) and 22 adults (aged 18 to 
      45 years) were assessed for contrast sensitivity to an illusory, flicker
      contrast-defined form (the letter 'E')--a task which was designed to rely to a
      large extent on magnocellular pathway function. Reading age (Neale Analysis of
      Reading) and mental age (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices) were assessed in 
      the children, who had been previously screened for clinically normal binocular
      vision and refractive anomalies. RESULTS: The ability of primary school-age
      children to discriminate the orientation of the low contrast flickered letters
      (from a choice of 4) showed a significant improvement from kindergarten (ages 4
      to 6 years) to grade 3 (ages 8 to 10 years) and older age groups. No significant 
      difference was found between good and disabled readers (at least 1-year lag in
      reading readiness for the kindergarten group and 2-year lag in reading
      performance for 8 to 10 and 10 to 12-year-olds). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that
      there is a developmental improvement in perceptual capacity for tasks attributed 
      to magnocellular function, which plateaus at the age of about 8 to 10 years.
      However, despite the reported reduction of magnocellular function in specific
      reading disabled children, no significant difference in contrast threshold for
      flicker-defined letter discrimination was found between good and poor readers.

TI  - A magnetic resonance imaging study of planum temporale asymmetry in men with
      developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1481-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Imaging studies have suggested anomalous anatomical asymmetries in
      language-related regions of the temporal and parietal lobes in individuals with
      developmental dyslexia. Autopsy studies have reported unusual symmetry of the
      planum temporale (PT) in patients with dyslexia. Methodological limitations
      characterize much of this literature, however. OBJECTIVE: To examine the size and
      asymmetry of the PT and its extension into the parietal lobe (planum parietale
      [PP]) in men with well-characterized, persistent dyslexia by using magnetic
      resonance imaging and 3-dimensional surface rendering techniques. METHODS: The
      brains of 16 right-handed dyslexic men aged 18 to 40 years and 14 matched control
      subjects were studied with magnetic resonance imaging. Most of these subjects
      were previously studied with positron emission tomography, which demonstrated
      functional abnormalities in temporal and parietal brain regions in the dyslexic
      group. The area of the PT was determined with the aid of 3-dimensional
      surface-rendering techniques. The size of the PP was estimated by measuring the
      length of the posterior ascending ramus on 3 parasagittal slices. RESULTS:
      Approximately 70% to 80% of both groups showed equivalent leftward (left > right)
      asymmetries of the PT; approximately 50% to 60% showed equivalent rightward
      (right > left) asymmetries of the PP. These asymmetries showed equivalent
      moderate inverse correlations with each other in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results challenge the notion that anomalous asymmetry of the PT is strongly
      associated with developmental dyslexia. Given the heterogeneity of the dyslexic
      population, some subgroup of dyslexic individuals (i.e., those with developmental
      language disorders) may show unusual symmetry or reversed asymmetry in this
      region. However, anomalous asymmetry of the planum did not contribute to
      functional abnormalities demonstrated in these patients by positron emission
      tomography.

TI  - Human behavioural genetics of cognitive abilities and disabilities.
PG  - 1117-24
AB  - Although neither the genome nor the environment can be manipulated in research on
      human behaviour, some of the new tools of molecular genetics can be brought to
      bear on human behavioural disorders (e.g. cognitive disabilities) and
      quantitative traits (e.g. cognitive abilities). The inability to manipulate the
      human genome experimentally has had the positive effect of focusing attention on 
      naturally occurring genetic variation responsible for behavioural differences
      among individuals in all their complex multifactorial splendour. Genes in such
      complex multiple-gene systems are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which
      merge the two worlds of genetic research, quantitative genetics and molecular
      genetics. Although most genetic research on complex human behaviour has focused
      on severe mental disorders, cognitive abilities and disabilities may be even more
      immediately relevant to neuroscience. For example, verbal ability and spatial
      ability are two of the most heritable cognitive abilities, and reading disability
      is the first behavioural disability for which replicated QTL linkage has been
      found. The purpose of this essay is to provide an overview of the genetics of
      cognitive abilities and disabilities as an example of the impending merger of
      quantitative genetics and molecular genetics in QTL analysis of complex traits.

AB  - In this review, we discuss recent data on the genetics of developmental dyslexia 
      and consider broader issues involved in the search for genes influencing complex 
      behavioral phenotypes. These issues include 1) the need for a sophisticated
      analysis of the phenotype and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration
      between geneticists and cognitive neuroscientists, 2) the likelihood of genetic
      heterogeneity and non-Mendelian inheritance and the necessity for linkage methods
      to deal with these issues, and 3) how association analyses complement linkage
      analyses.

TI  - Brain morphology in children with specific language impairment.
PG  - 1272-84
AB  - The planum temporale and pars triangularis have been found to be larger in the
      left hemisphere than the right in individuals with normal language skills. Brain 
      morphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders report
      reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum, although the bulk of this research 
      has been completed on adults with dyslexia. Pars triangularis has not been
      studied in the developmental language impaired population. In this study,
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used for quantitative comparisons of the
      planum temporale (Wernicke's area) and pars triangularis (Broca's area) in
      children with specific language impairment (SLI) and children with normal
      language skills. The subjects were 11 children with SLI and 19 age- and
      sex-matched controls between 5.6 and 13.0 years old. Each subject received a
      neurolinguistic battery of tests and a high resolution volumetric MRI scan. Major
      results were that (a) pars triangularis was significantly smaller in the left
      hemisphere of children with SLI, and (b) children with SLI were more likely to
      have rightward asymmetry of language structures. Furthermore, anomalous
      morphology in these language areas correlated with depressed language ability.
      These findings support the hypothesis that language impairment is a consequence
      of an underlying neurobiological defect in areas of the brain known to subserve
      language.

TI  - Attenuated auditory event-related potential (mismatch negativity) in children
      with developmental dysphasia.
PG  - 253-6
AB  - An attention-independent negative wave-form termed 'mismatch negativity' (MMN) of
      the auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) was studied in ten children (3-6
      years) with developmental dysphasia and in fourteen control children (3-7 years) 
      with normal speech and language development. The MMNs were elicited with pure
      sine tone stimuli using the oddball paradigm. The peak latency and peak amplitude
      of MMN response to frequency (500/553 H2) difference was measured. The grand
      average amplitude of frequency MMN was significantly attenuated in dysphasic
      children as compared to controls, but no significant difference was observed in
      the latency of peak frequency MMN. The results indicate that dysphasic children
      have a defect in automatic auditory processing of frequency differences. Because 
      the MMN response reflects central auditory processing and is modal specific for
      auditory stimuli we argue that the MMN method can serve as an objective tool to
      assess central auditory deficits in children.

AB  - A 43-year-old woman was admitted into our hospital because of aphasia and right
      hemiparesis. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated border zone infarction in the
      anterior and middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed the 
      borderline area between the terminal branches of the lenticulostriate arteries
      and the perforating branches of the middle cerebral artery. Digital subtraction
      ICA angiogram showed severe narrowing of the distal portion of the right and left
      ICA. A pattern analysis of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was
      carried out in this patient, and it was showed "dipper type". Laboratory data was
      elevated excretion of pituitary gonadotropines and low estrogen excretion.
      Chromosome analysis revealed the 45, X/46, XX. She was diagnosed with mosaic type
      of Turner's syndrome. The cerebrovascular abnormality might be due to congenital 
      hypoplasia of arteries, and declining of blood pressure during sleep was possible
      significant factors in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction in this patient.

TI  - Auditory event-related potentials in the study of developmental language-related 
      disorders.
PG  - 308-40
AB  - This article reviews recent auditory event-related potential (ERP) studies of
      developmental language disorder (DLD) and dyslexia/reading disorder (RD). The
      possibility of using ERPs in searching for precursors of these disorders in the
      early development of infants at risk is also discussed. Differences in
      exogenous/sensory ERPs at the latency range of P1 and N1-P2 components have been 
      reported between groups with DLD and RD and control groups. Latency differences
      between the groups may be related to a common timing deficit suggested by some
      researchers to be one of the possible underlying factors both in DLD and
      dyslexia. N1 amplitude group differences may be partly related to
      arousal/attentional factors and partly to the 'tuning' of the auditory sensory
      system. Mismatch negativity deviations in DLD children seem to indicate
      differences in sensory memory functions. Differences between the reviewed
      clinical groups and controls exist also in the endogenous P3 component, though
      less consistently in DLD children. In both clinical groups the P3 amplitudes are,
      in general, lower and the latencies longer compared to those in controls. These
      findings are discussed in terms of possible differences in higher cognitive
      functions that are not specific to modality. Altered hemispheric asymmetries in
      DLD and RD children, as compared to controls, are commonly found in many of the
      reviewed ERP components. Differences in ERPs of DLD and dyslexic children in
      comparison to controls may not reflect only maturational lag but also more
      fundamental processing deficiencies.

TI  - Connectionism, phonology, reading, and regularity in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 207-35
AB  - Tests of the "phonological deficit" account of developmental dyslexia have
      produced apparently inconsistent results. We show how a connectionist approach to
      dyslexic reading development can resolve the paradox. A "dyslexic" model of
      reading was created by reducing the quality of the phonological representations
      available to the model during learning. The model behaved similarly to dyslexic
      children in that it had a selectively reduced ability to process nonwords, but
      showed normal effects of words' spelling-to-sound regularity. An experimental
      test of the model's predictions confirmed that dyslexic children perform
      similarly, in that they are impaired on irregular words to the same extent as
      nondyslexic children. It is concluded that developmentally dyslexic reading can
      indeed be understood in terms of impaired phonological representations and that
      the adoption of a modeling approach resolves an apparent paradox in the
      experimental literature.

TI  - Orthographic analogies and developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 423-40
AB  - Goswami (1986, 1988) has demonstrated that children can use orthographic
      analogies (particularly at the onset-rime level) between the spelling patterns in
      words to help to decode new words (e.g. using 'beak' to read 'peak'). This
      strategy has been shown in children as young as six years old. Since it is known 
      that children with developmental dyslexia find it particularly difficult to read 
      words that they have not been specifically taught (Lovett, Warren-Chaplin, Ransby
      & Borden, 1990), the present study investigated whether dyslexic children might
      be unable to use analogies. Employing a design similar to that used by Goswami
      (1988), it was hypothesized that dyslexics would find it difficult to transfer
      spontaneously knowledge of a 'clue' word to decode new words that could be read
      by analogy with the clue word. The results of Expt 1 indicated that the dyslexic 
      readers read significantly fewer of the analogous words than a reading
      age-matched comparison group of younger children. Furthermore, none of the nine
      dyslexic children read as many of the analogous words as the lowest scoring
      control child. In a second experiment, a design similar to that of Muter,
      Snowling & Taylor (1994) was used with a new and larger sample of dyslexic
      children. In this experiment, all the children were brought to criterion in
      reading the clue words before the analogous words were presented. Once again, the
      dyslexic children read significantly fewer words that were analogous with the
      clue words than did a reading age-matched comparison group. The number of
      analogous words that the dyslexic children read was significantly correlated with
      their performance on a test that is sensitive to the ability to detect rhyme. It 
      is argued that a failure to make analogies may be one of the main causes of the
      reading impairment experienced by children with developmental dyslexia.

TI  - The pattern of neurological sequelae of childhood cerebral malaria among
      survivors in Calabar, Nigeria.
PG  - 231-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern and long term outcome of neurological
      complications following cerebral malaria (CM) in a group of Nigerian children
      treated in Calabar. DESIGN: Prospective, follow up study. SETTING: Children's
      emergency room (CHER) of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH)
      located in a malaria-holoendemic rainforest belt of south eastern Nigeria.
      SUBJECTS: Survivors among 45 children with CM treated between February and
      December, 1991. All received intravenous quinine infusion and supportive care.
      Survivors (39) were followed up until detected neurological sequelae had
      resolved. RESULTS: Case fatality rate was 13.3%, 95% CI. Eleven (28.2%) of the
      survivors developed neurological sequelae. Prolonged coma, focal seizures and
      abnormal posturing (decorticate/decerebrate) were associated with increased risk 
      of sequelae. Commonest neurological sequelae were cortical blindness (3/11),
      speech disorders (3/11: aphasia or echolalia) and motor abnormalities (5/11:
      dyskinesia/hemiplegia). Eight cases recovered completely from the neurological
      deficits within a mean period of three (1.3) weeks. One persisted with
      hyperactivity and attention deficit, had a remarkable improvement at the sixth
      month of follow up but developed secondary dyslexia and other learning
      disabilities by the third year of follow up. CONCLUSION: Although short lived,
      neurological sequelae of CM appear common among these Nigerian children. This
      problem could significantly add to the burden of childhood disability in Nigeria.
      Early diagnosis, use of appropriate drugs and large scale malaria control
      programmes can prevent malady.

TI  - Are speech perception deficits associated with developmental dyslexia?
PG  - 211-35
AB  - Phonological awareness and phoneme identification tasks were administered to
      dyslexic children and both chronological age (CA) and reading-level (RL)
      comparison groups. Dyslexic children showed less sharply defined categorical
      perception of a bath-path continuum varying voice onset time when compared to the
      CA but not the RL group. The dyslexic children were divided into two subgroups
      based on phoneme awareness. Dyslexics with low phonemic awareness made poorer
      /b/-/p/ distinctions than both CA and RL groups, but dyslexics with normal
      phonemic awareness did not. Examination of individual profiles revealed that the 
      majority of subjects in each group exhibited normal categorical perception.
      However, 7 of 25 dyslexics had abnormal identification functions, compared to 1
      subject in the CA group and 3 in the RL group. The results suggest that some
      dyslexic children have a perceptual deficit that may interfere with processing of
      phonological information. Speech perception difficulties may also be partially
      related to reading experience.

TI  - Scalp potentials evoked by amplitude-modulated tones in dyslexia.
PG  - 939-45
AB  - We recorded the far-field EEG potential evoked by amplitude modulation of
      acoustic stimuli (the amplitude modulation following response, AMFR) in adults
      with developmental dyslexia and in a matched control group of adults with no
      history of reading problems. The mean AMFR recorded from participants with
      dyslexia was significantly smaller than that recorded from members of the control
      group. In contrast, the amplitude of the click-evoked auditory brainstem response
      (ABR) was not significantly different between participant groups. Also, there was
      no difference between participant groups in the latency of the AMFR or ABR. The
      reduced AMFR in listeners with dyslexia may reflect impaired ability of the
      auditory system to follow rapid changes in stimulus energy, a cue believed to be 
      important in the perception of speech.

TI  - Effect of time and frequency manipulation on syllable perception in developmental
      dyslexics.
PG  - 912-24
AB  - Many people with developmental dyslexia have difficulty perceiving stop consonant
      contrasts as effectively as other people and it has been suggested that this may 
      be due to perceptual limitations of a temporal nature. Accordingly, we predicted 
      that perception of such stimuli by listeners with dyslexia might be improved by
      stretching them in time-equivalent to speaking slowly. Conversely, their
      perception of the same stimuli ought to be made even worse by compressing them in
      time-equivalent to speaking quickly. We tested 15 children with dyslexia on their
      ability to identify correctly consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) stimuli that had
      been stretched or compressed in the time domain. We also tested their perception 
      of the same CVC stimuli after the formant transitions had been stretched or
      compressed in the frequency domain. Contrary to our predictions, we failed to
      find any systematic improvement in their performance with either manipulation. We
      conclude that simple manipulations in the time and frequency domains are unlikely
      to benefit the ability of people with dyslexia to discriminate between CVCs
      containing stop consonants.

      deficiency].
PG  - 717-20
AB  - We report a 49-year-old man who had right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. A
      computed tomography revealed hypodense areas in the left frontal subcortex. A
      cerebral angiography demonstrated occlusion of the left distal internal carotid
      artery and both anterior cerebral arteries, as well as stenosis of the left
      internal carotid artery at the cervical portion. The second angiogram obtained a 
      month later showed no changes. The diagnosis of atherothrombotic cerebral
      infarction was established on the basis of clinical profile and angiographic
      findings. Protein C activity and antigen levels were reduced to approximately one
      half of the normal level in the patient and his brother. The patient had no other
      risk factors for stroke. Protein C deficiency has been considered one of the risk
      factors for thrombotic diseases. Venous thrombosis is the most common clinical
      manifestation, whereas arterial thrombosis is relatively rare. It is generally
      believed that arterial ischemic stroke associated with protein C deficiency
      occurs with embolic mechanism, and atherothrombotic infarction is extremely rare.
      This is the first report suggesting the possibility that protein C deficiency can
      cause cerebral thrombosis.

TI  - Phonological awareness deficits in developmental dyslexia and the phonological
      representations hypothesis.
PG  - 18-41
AB  - The claim that the well-documented difficulties shown by dyslexic children in
      phonological awareness tasks may arise from deficits in the accuracy and the
      segmental organization of the phonological representations of words in their
      mental lexicons is receiving increasing interest from researchers. In this
      experiment, two versions of the phonological representations hypothesis were
      investigated by using a picture naming task and a battery of phonological
      measures at three linguistic levels (syllable, onset-rime, phoneme). The picture 
      naming task was used to identify words for which dyslexic and control children
      had accurate vs inaccurate phonological representations, and performance in the
      phonological awareness tasks was then compared for the words which had precise vs
      imprecise representations. Findings indicated that frequency effects in the
      phonological awareness tasks at all levels disappeared for dyslexic and control
      children once representational quality was taken into account, and that the
      availability of sublexical units for analysis appeared to differ according to (1)
      the accuracy and retrieval of the phonological representation and (2) the
      linguistic level tapped by the phonological awareness task.

      developmental language disorders.
PG  - 117-24
AB  - This article discusses findings using various imaging techniques regarding the
      neurological underpinnings of developmental language and learning disorders.
      Evidence from magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, 
      single photon emission spectroscopy, and positron emission tomography implicates 
      the left perisylvian regions in the processing of phonemes and auditory
      information, as had been predicted from lesion data and from neurobiological
      theory. The areas of the planum temporale and angular gyrus have been found to be
      compromised in children and adults with dyslexia or language impairment. Emerging
      evidence suggests that these differences are also present in members of families 
      with a history of developmental language disorders, which provides support for a 
      transmittable, biological factor involved in such disorders. Dynamic imaging
      procedures are beginning to provide an understanding of the relationship between 
      structure and function in normal and abnormal language acquisition.

TI  - Developmental surface dyslexia is not associated with deficits in the transient
      visual system.
PG  - 1807-12
AB  - Deficits of the transient visual system have been reported in unselected groups
      of dyslexics. The aim of this study was to examine whether this finding holds
      when subjects with a specific type of developmental reading disorder (surface
      dyslexia) are considered. Ten Italian children were examined. They all presented 
      the characteristic markers of surface dyslexia: slow and laborious reading with
      errors in tasks which cannot be solved with a grapheme-phoneme conversion (i.e., 
      homophones). Contrast sensitivity thresholds to phase-reversal gratings were
      within normal limits for most subjects both for stimuli presented centrally and
      in the right parafovea. This indicates that developmental surface dyslexia is not
      associated with a deficit in the transient system. In contrast, sensitivity to
      high spatial frequency stationary stimuli was reduced.

      phonological processing in dyslexic men.
PG  - 562-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Developmental dyslexia is characterized by impaired word recognition,
      which is thought to result from deficits in phonological processing. Improvements
      during the course of development are thought to disproportionately involve
      orthographic components of reading; phonological deficits persist into adulthood.
      OBJECTIVE: To localize the neural correlates of impaired word recognition and
      phonological processing in men with developmental dyslexia. METHODS: Regional
      cerebral blood flow was measured with oxygen 15 positron emission tomography in
      17 men with dyslexia and in 14 matched controls during the performance of
      phonological and orthographic tasks--pronunciation (reading aloud) and lexical
      decision making--designed to activate posterior and anterior perisylvian
      cortices, respectively. RESULTS: Altered patterns of activation (reduced
      activation, unusual deactivation) were seen in dyslexic men in mid- to posterior 
      temporal cortex bilaterally and in inferior parietal cortex, predominantly on the
      left, during both pronunciation and decision making. In contrast, dyslexic men
      demonstrated essentially normal activation of left inferior frontal cortex during
      both phonological and orthographic decision making. CONCLUSION: These, along with
      prior findings, are compatible with a hypothesis of bilateral involvement of
      posterior temporal and parietal cortices in dyslexia.

TI  - Familial dyslexia associated with cavum vergae.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - Three members of one family, diagnosed as dyslexic, are described. All of them
      have variations of midline cavity: cavum vergae or cavum septum pellucidum,
      diagnosed by neuroradiological examination. In contrast, the non dyslexic members
      of the same family have no neuroanatomical congenital variations. We raise the
      possibility of a functional correlation between the dyslexia and the anatomical
      findings in the affected members of this family.

AB  - We reported a 7-year-old, right-handed boy whose reading and writing of kana and 
      kanji were impaired. He also showed a severe deficit in visuo-spatial perception 
      skills. Nevertheless, his ability to read and write kana characters was
      facilitated by means of the Japanese Syllabaries. It is generally considered that
      the Syllabary involve two kinds of language modalities: auditory-verbal and
      visuo-verbal language systems. In spite of his intact auditory-verbal language
      system, his visuo-verbal language skills involved in writing kanji were severely 
      impaired. It was suggested that a severe deficit of visuo-spatial perception
      skills influenced performance of visuo-verbal language systems. Accordingly, we
      inferred that the patient recalled a kana character by use of the Japanese
      Syllabaries based on his good auditory-verbal language system, and supposed that 
      his reading and writing disorders were similar to alexia with agraphia in adult
      patients with angular lesions.

TI  - [The neurology of dyslexia].
PG  - 739-43
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a heterogeneous disorder in which the prominent
      manifestation is a discrepancy between reading achievement and intelligence.
      There is no serious auditory, visual, psychiatric, social or educational factor
      that could be responsible of the discrepancy. Males are more often affected than 
      females. It is a pervasive condition but with adequate help and spontaneous
      compensation, reading ability may improve. Neuroimaging, mainly MRI, allows to
      demonstrate in two thirds, an absence of the usual symmetry of the planum
      temporale favoring the left side. Twenty to 25% of the remaining cases show
      asymmetry of the right side. Etiology is unknown but heredity plays an important 
      role. The pathology of dyslexia has revealed abnormalities of the cerebral cortex
      focal four-layer microgyria, microdysgenesis and arteriovenous malformations.
      Galaburda hypothesises that a pre or perinatal adverse event produces a basic
      cognitive, progressive alteration, that eventually invades the perceptual
      elements (visual, phonological, semantic-syntaxic difficulties). Heilman, Voeller
      and Alexander propose a motor-articulatory feedback hypothesis.

TI  - To see but not to read; the magnocellular theory of dyslexia.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - Developmental dyslexics often complain that small letters appear to blur and move
      around when they are trying to read. Anatomical, electrophysiological,
      psychophysical and brain-imaging studies have all contributed to elucidating the 
      functional organization of these and other visual confusions. They emerge not
      from damage to a single visual relay but from abnormalities of the magnocellular 
      component of the visual system, which is specialized for processing fast temporal
      information. The m-stream culminates in the posterior parietal cortex, which
      plays an important role in guiding visual attention. The evidence is consistent
      with an increasingly sophisticated account of dyslexia that does not single out
      either phonological, or visual or motor deficits. Rather, temporal processing in 
      all three systems seems to be impaired. Dyslexics may be unable to process fast
      incoming sensory information adequately in any domain.

PG  - 901-5
AB  - We investigated whether adolescents and adults with the developmental
      social-emotional processing disorder (SEPD) exhibit deficits in visual attention,
      as measured by eye movements, when compared with dyslexic and normal control
      subjects. On the antisaccade task, subjects with SEPD made more errors than
      either control group and were the only group to show a decrease in performance
      accuracy compared with prosaccade. This deficit in inhibiting reflexive shifts of
      attention and gaze suggests that individuals with SEPD have dysfunction of the
      prefrontal component of the right hemisphere dominant network for spatially
      directed attention.

TI  - Visual-perceptual and phonological factors in the acquisition of literacy among
      children with congenital developmental coordination disorder.
PG  - 158-66
AB  - Much research has shown that children with congenital developmental coordination 
      disorder (CDCD) have marked impairments in the perception of visual-spatial
      information, a deficit which has been assumed to be causally related to
      difficulties that many CDCD children experience when learning to read and spell. 
      However, current research in reading disability suggests that poor reading is
      mainly related to difficulties with the processing of phonological information or
      with metaphonological ability, not to visual-perceptual deficits. This study
      aimed to explore the relationship between reading achievement and the
      visual-perceptual, phonological and general cognitive ability of CDCD children.
      Twenty-eight children with a mean age of 8.3 years were tested on motor
      coordination, language, general ability, visual discrimination, visual-motor
      integration, phoneme awareness, phoneme discrimination, reading and spelling.
      Results showed that phoneme awareness was the most strongly related to reading
      and spelling performance, and that visual discrimination showed no relationship
      to reading ability, although it was related to spelling performance, phonological
      awareness, and motor coordination. These results suggest that CDCD children who
      have difficulty with the acquisition of literacy may suffer from
      visual-perceptual problems and metaphonological deficits, but these problems are 
      differentially related to reading and spelling.

TI  - Definition and treatment of dyslexia: a report by the Committee on Dyslexia of
      the Health Council of The Netherlands.
PG  - 209-13
AB  - A committee of the Health Council of the Netherlands prepared a report on the
      definition and treatment of dyslexia at the request of the Minister of Health,
      Welfare, and Sport (see Note). The Health Council, as charged by the Health Act, 
      is to inform the government on the state of science with respect to public health
      issues. The Council is entirely funded by the government but otherwise completely
      independent (an independence guaranteed by law). The committee was formed to
      answer questions regarding the provisions and funds needed for the treatment of
      persons with dyslexia, neuropsychological treatment modalities, in particular,
      and the role of speech and language therapists. Definitive decision making about 
      reimbursement by the Dutch National Health Service for treatment by speech and
      language therapists in cases of dyslexia was on hold, pending the committee's
      report. Specific attention was requested for the following aspects: the
      definition of dyslexia (the characteristic symptoms of this category of
      developmental language disabilities); the consequences of the proposed definition
      for indication and treatment; the appropriate methods of treatment; the
      involvement of several possible professionals (e.g., neuropsychologist, remedial 
      teacher, speech and language therapist), as well as the role of the neurologist
      during and in relation to the treatment process; and those situations in which
      treatment should be the responsibility of the health care system. This article
      summarizes the committee's considerations and conclusions on these different
      aspects.

TI  - Picture naming deficits in developmental dyslexia: the phonological
      representations hypothesis.
PG  - 334-53
AB  - The picture and word naming performance of developmental dyslexics was compared
      to the picture and word naming performance of non-dyslexic ("garden variety")
      poor readers, reading age, and chronological age-matched controls. The stimulus
      list used for both tasks was systematically manipulated for word length and word 
      frequency. In order to examine picture naming errors in more depth, an object
      name recognition test assessed each subject's vocabulary knowledge of those names
      which they were unable to spontaneously label in the picture naming task.
      Findings indicated that the dyslexic and the garden variety poor readers
      exhibited a picture naming deficit relative to both chronological and reading
      age-matched controls. Findings also indicated that both groups of impaired
      readers obtained superior scores in the word naming task than in the picture
      naming task, while both groups of controls showed no difference in performance
      across tasks. The dyslexics' picture naming errors, but not those of the garden
      variety poor readers, were particularly marked on polysyllabic and/or low
      frequency words, indicating a possible phonological basis to the picture naming
      deficit of the dyslexic children. These children also recognized significantly
      more unnamed target words than all comparison groups, suggesting a particular
      difficulty in retrieving the phonological codes of known picture names rather
      than a vocabulary deficit. Results are discussed in terms of dyslexics'
      difficulty in encoding full segmental phonological representations of names in
      long-term memory and/or in processing these representations in order to generate 
      required names on demand.

PG  - 72-5
AB  - Ninety eight children with epilepsy attending the Neurology clinic, University of
      Ilorin Teaching Hospital over a two year period were studied prospectively. Males
      were more affected than females in a ratio of 5:3. Generalised tonic-clonic
      seizures accounted for 62.2% of the cases, and partial seizures for 17.4%.
      Infantile spasms were seen exclusively in infants less than two years old and
      absence and generalised seizures in children more than three years of age. Skull 
      radiography showed abnormal findings in 11.2%. Ectroencephalography showed
      typical findings in 43.9%. Hemiplegia was the most common neurological sequelae
      (30.3%). Other sequelae include hyperactivity, irrational behaviour, expressive
      aphasia, mental subnormality, deafness, and blindness in that order. Therapy with
      a single appropriate anticonvulsant was usually effective for seizure control
      except in some patients with focal seizures, infantile spasms, severely delayed
      developmental milestones and prolonged seizures. Poor drug compliance remains the
      major constraint to adequate seizure control, further compounded in this
      environment by nonavailability of drugs and unaffordable costs.

      chromosomes 6 and 15.
PG  - 27-39
AB  - Six extended dyslexic families with at least four affected individuals were
      genotyped with markers in three chromosomal regions: 6p23-p21.3, 15pter-qter, and
      16pter-qter. Five theoretically derived phenotypes were used in the linkage
      analyses: (1) phonological awareness; (2) phonological decoding; (3) rapid
      automatized naming; (4) single-word reading; and (5) discrepancy between
      intelligence and reading performance, an empirically derived, commonly used
      phenotype. Two-point and multipoint allele-sharing analyses of chromosome 6
      markers revealed significant evidence (P < 10(-6)) for linkage of the
      phonological awareness phenotype to five adjacent markers (D6S109, D6S461,
      D6S299, D6S464, and D6S306). The least compelling results were obtained with
      single-word reading. In contrast, with chromosome 15 markers, a LOD score of 3.15
      was obtained for marker D15S143 at theta = 0.0 with single-word reading.
      Multipoint analyses with markers adjacent to D15S143 (D15S126, D15S132, D15S214, 
      and D15S128) were positive, but none reached acceptable significance levels.
      Chromosome 15 analyses with the phonological awareness phenotype were negative.
      Parametric and nonparametric linkage analyses with chromosome 16 markers were
      negative. The most intriguing aspect of the current findings is that two very
      distinct reading-related phenotypes, reflecting different levels in the hierarchy
      of reading-related skills, each contributing to different processes, appear to be
      linked to two different chromosomal regions.

TI  - Neuropsychological profiles of children diagnosed as specific language impaired
      with and without hyperlexia.
PG  - 223-9
AB  - This study compared the neuropsychological profiles of 46 children with Specific 
      Language Impairment (SLI) and 16 children with SLI and Hyperlexia (SLI + H). The 
      results indicated that the essential feature of Hyperlexia is Specific Language
      Impairment and not reading disability. Thus, Hyperlexia would be best
      conceptualized as a subgroup of Developmental Language Disorder rather than as a 
      subgroup of Developmental Dyslexia. Further, the SLI + H group exhibited
      significantly better developed visual/spatial memory which, along with average
      visual perceptual skills, appears to be the major contributing factor to their
      elevated word recognition and spelling ability. Finally, it should be noted that 
      both groups of children exhibited decreasing performance on tasks of immediate
      auditory/verbal memory as the language/semantic demands of the memory task
      increased. This finding appears to be the result of a limited capacity for
      immediate verbal processing and not the result of a deficit in verbal learning
      and recall.

AB  - Focal hypersynchronous activity in children with specific developmental deficits:
      Are there any clinical implications? To determine the frequency of focal
      hypersynchronous activity (HSA) in the EEGs of a child and adolescent psychiatry 
      client population we evaluated 762 patients between 3 and 15 years old. Children 
      with neurological problems, including epilepsy, craniocerebral trauma and
      psychotic disorders, and children on medication were excluded, as well as those
      with general developmental delays or abnormal EEG findings (except focal HSA). We
      then compared our data with those of two epidemiological investigations, in which
      1.9% and 2.4%, respectively, of the children without psychiatric problems were
      found to have focal HSA. The children in our study with dyslexia or disorders of 
      motor function had significantly higher rates of HSA. The boys with psychiatric
      findings (except those with speech and language disorders) appeared to have a
      higher rate of HSA. These findings support the hypothesis that focal HSA is
      probably an expression of a cerebral dysfunction of genetic origin. The
      symptomatology seems to depend on the moment of manifestation and the
      localization.

      combination of stimulus rate or contrast that was tested. Thus, these findings do
      not support a magnocellular processing deficit in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Children with benign focal sharp waves in the EEG--developmental disorders and
      epilepsy.
PG  - 227-41
AB  - Focal sharp waves (shw) in the childhood EEG with predominantly centrotemporal
      localization are a diagnostic hallmark of idiopathic partial epilepsy and have
      been shown to be genetically determined. Absence of neurological and
      neuropsychological impairment was long considered to be a prerequisite for
      diagnosis. For years, this diagnostic paradigm obscured the large phenotypic
      variability of genetically determined focal shw. The purpose of the present
      review is to survey and critically evaluate the widely dispersed literature on
      this topic. Two main groups can be distinguished: Idiopathic partial epilepsies
      and specific developmental disorders such as dysphasia, dyslexia etc. These
      conditions, however, do not represent clear-cut nosologic entities, but exhibit
      large symptomatic overlaps. In non-epileptic children, developmental disabilities
      constitute the main symptoms, in epileptic children-at least in non-selected
      groups-they are an optional feature. Conversely, epileptic phenomena can dominate
      the clinical picture or be an optional symptom in developmentally disabled
      children. The wide spectrum of epileptic and non-epileptic disorders probably
      represents the multifarious clinical manifestations of a common widespread,
      genetically determined pathogenetic mechanism. The marked age-dependency of the
      EEG and clinical symptoms, and the almost regular disappearance of both at
      puberty appear to justify the hypothesis of a hereditary impairment of brain
      maturation. The large phenotypic variability can be explained by differences in
      location and extent of the maturational disturbance as well as by the effect of
      additional genetic and environmental factors. The nature and cause of the
      hypothetical maturational disturbance are still unknown.

TI  - Auditory temporal coding in dyslexia.
PG  - 961-5
AB  - Developmental dyslexia is generally believed to result from impaired linguistic
      processing rather than from deficits in low-level sensory function. Challenging
      this view, we studied the perception of non-verbal acoustic stimuli and low-level
      auditory evoked potentials in dyslexic adults. Compared with matched controls,
      dyslexics were selectively impaired in tasks (frequency discrimination and
      binaural unmasking) which rely on decoding neural discharges phase-locked to the 
      fine structure of the stimulus. Furthermore, this ability to use phase-locking
      was related to reading ability. In addition, the evoked potential reflecting
      phase-locked discharges was significantly smaller in dyslexics. These results
      demonstrate a low-level auditory impairment in dyslexia traceable to the
      brainstem nuclei.

TI  - Family patterns of developmental dyslexia. Part III: Spelling errors as
      behavioral phenotype.
PG  - 378-86
AB  - The major trends in current research on developmental dyslexia assume that
      impaired phonological processing is the core deficit in this disorder. Our
      earlier studies indicated that half of all dyslexic persons have significant
      deficits of bimanual motor coordination, and that impaired temporal resolution in
      motor action may identify a vertically transmitted behavioral phenotype in
      familial dyslexia. This report examines the relationship between spelling errors 
      as a measure of impaired phonological processing and motor coordination deficits 
      in the same dyslexia families. Affected family members with motor coordination
      deficits made significantly more dysphonetic spelling errors than dyslexic family
      members without motor deficits, but there was no evidence that dysphonetic
      spelling is vertically transmitted in dyslexia families. On the other hand,
      affected offspring of affected parents with motor coordination deficits made
      relatively more dysphonetic spelling errors than the affected offspring of
      parents without motor coordination deficits. We suggest that dysphonetic spelling
      may be one outward expression of a vertically transmitted behavioral phenotype of
      impaired temporal resolution that is clearly expressed in coordinated motor
      action.

      BP-only group, while the RD-only group was similar to the Comparison group, until
      school age. The gender composition of the two RD groups differed, and the RD-BP
      boys showed the most problematic characteristics. The findings indicate different
      developmental pathways for "pure' RD children and those with comorbid BPs.

TI  - [Developmental dysphasia].
PG  - 580-7
AB  - Developmental dysphasia is characterized by severe, specific and unexplained
      developmental language impairment. Phonologic and syntactic disorders of
      expressive language and perceptual deficit are almost always present. Moreover,
      certain specific linguistic symptoms are particular to each dysphasic child,
      explaining the efforts to classify different forms of dysphasia. The most
      important point is to separate receptive dysphasia from the expressive on the one
      hand, and severe forms from the mild which are closed to "simple language delay",
      on the other. The evolution of oral language is variable, but often long and
      difficult, with persistent linguistic deficit. Reading and writing acquisition is
      usually difficult, although very important for the socio-professional outcome and
      language improvement. The etiology remains unknown and is probably
      multifactorial. One pathogenic hypothesis is based on the absence of the usual
      hemisphere specialisation related to various prenatal or postnatal events. A
      genetic basis seems likely for certain dysphasic children. Development of
      knowledge about this condition and improvement of both speech therapy and
      teaching are essential for the outcome of these otherwise intelligent and normal 
      children.

      which assess phonological awareness. One reason for this association might be
      that the early or "input" phonological representations of speech sounds are
      distorted or noisy in some way. We have attempted to test this hypothesis
      directly. In Experiment 1, we measured the confusions that adult dyslexics and
      controls made when they listened to nine randomly presented consonant-vowel (CV) 
      segments [sequence: see text] under four conditions of increasing white noise
      masking. Subjects could replay stimuli and were under no obligation to respond
      quickly. Responses were selected with a computer mouse from a set of nine
      letter-strings, corresponding to the auditory stimuli, presented on a VDU. While 
      the overall pattern of confusions made by dyslexics and controls was very similar
      for this stimulus set, dyslexics confused [sequence: see text] significantly more
      than did controls. In Experiment 2, subjects heard each stimulus once only and
      were forced to respond as quickly as possible. Under these timed conditions, the 
      pattern of confusions made by dyslexics and controls was the same as before, but 
      dyslexics took longer to respond than controls. The slower responses of dyslexics
      in Experiment 2 could have arisen because: (a) they were slower at processing the
      auditory stimuli than controls, (b) they had worse visual pattern memory for
      letter strings than controls, (c) they were slower than controls at using the
      computer mouse. In Experiments 3, 4 and 5 subjects carried out control tasks
      which eliminated each of these possibilities and confirmed that the results from 
      the auditory tasks genuinely reflected subjects' speech perception. We propose
      that the fine structure of dyslexics' input phonological representations should
      be further explored with this confusion paradigm by using other speech sounds
      containing VCs, CCVs and VCCs.

TI  - Transvaginal sonographic detection of adducted thumbs, hydrocephalus, and
      agenesis of the corpus callosum at 22 postmenstrual weeks: the masa spectrum or
      L1 spectrum. A case report and review of the literature.
PG  - 543-8
AB  - Prenatal diagnosis of non-chromosomal syndromes relies, among others, on the
      detection of specific morphological findings. In rare syndromes the index case
      may not be prenatally diagnosed but subsequent pregnancies may benefit from early
      diagnosis. In this article we discuss the clinical spectrum of an X-linked
      hereditary disease which contains hydrocephalus, congenital agenesis of the
      corpus callosum, adducted thumbs, shuffling gait, aphasia, mental retardation,
      and at times other associated findings. The purpose of this case report is to
      describe the prenatal sonographic findings of a fetus affected with adducted
      thumbs, hydrocephaly, and agenesis of te corpus callosum. The patient was
      referred at 22 1/2 weeks' gestation for prenatal diagnosis. Ultrasound revealed a
      male fetus with dilatation of the lateral ventricles and partial agenesis of the 
      corpus callosum. The fetal hands showed the thumbs to be fixed in a
      flexed-adducted position. These findings were consistent with the MASA spectrum
      (mental retardation-aphasia-shuffling gait-adducted thumbs) present in the older 
      brother. The patient elected to terminate the pregnancy and autopsy confirmed the
      sonographic findings. In conclusion, prenatal sonography, especially the presence
      of adducted thumbs, allowed prenatal diagnosis of the second affected child with 
      the MASA spectrum in this family. This morphology-based approach becomes feasible
      between postmenstrual weeks 15 and 20. Prior to this gestational age, the
      diagnosis should rely on molecular biology tests.

TI  - Reading problems and antisocial behaviour: developmental trends in comorbidity.
PG  - 405-18
AB  - Samples of poor and normal readers were followed through adolescence and into
      early adulthood to assess continuities in the comorbidity between reading
      difficulties and disruptive behaviour problems. Reading-disabled boys showed high
      rates of inattentiveness in middle childhood, but no excess of teacher-rated
      behaviour problems at age 14 and no elevated rates of aggression, antisocial
      personality disorder or officially recorded offending in early adulthood.
      Increased risks of juvenile offending among specifically retarded-reading boys
      seemed associated with poor school attendance, rather than reading difficulties
      per se. Reading problems were associated with some increases in disruptive
      behaviour in their teens in girls.

PG  - 347-50
AB  - We reported a case of juvenile cerebral infarction following minor head injury.
      The patient, a 12-year-old girl, developed right hemiparesis and aphasia almost
      immediately after having fallen from about 1 meter height during the exercise
      class at school. CT and MRI study showed lacunar lesions bilaterally and almost
      symmetrically in the paraventricular deep white matter on both sides. A new
      stroke area, responsible for the symptoms, was recognized about 24 hours later on
      CT scan just next to the lacuna of the left side. Although angiography revealed a
      rare anomaly of the right side aortic arch, associated with subclavian steal
      phenomenon, presumably of congenital in nature, no abnormality was found in the
      intracranial vessels. She made a rapid recovery during her hospital stay and
      showed no more than a slight motor weakness in her right upper extremity on
      discharge. The literature was reviewed on the embryology of the aortic arch and
      brachiocephalic arteries. We speculate that the lacunar lesions found bilaterally
      are dilated large normal Virchow-Robin space, and the pathogenesis of the stroke 
      in this patient was discussed.

TI  - Is developmental dyslexia a disconnection syndrome? Evidence from PET scanning.
PG  - 143-57
AB  - A rhyming and short-term memory task with visually presented letters were used to
      study brain activity in five compensated adult developmental dyslexics. Their
      only cognitive difficulty was in phonological processing, manifest in a wide
      range of tasks including spoonerisms, phonemic fluency and digit naming speed.
      PET scans showed that for the dyslexics, a subset only of the brain regions
      normally involved in phonological processing was activated: Broca's area during
      the rhyming task, temporo-parietal cortex during the short- term memory task. In 
      contrast to normal controls these areas were not activated in concert.
      Furthermore the left insula was never activated. We propose that the defective
      phonological system of these dyslexics is due to weak connectivity between
      anterior and posterior language areas. This could be due to a dysfunctional left 
      insula which may normally act as an anatomical bridge between Broca's area,
      superior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. The independent activation of the
      posterior and anterior speech areas in dyslexics supports the notion that
      representations of unsegmented and segmented phonology are functionally and
      anatomically separate.

PG  - 373-85
AB  - This study investigated whether adult developmental dyslexics differ from normal 
      controls in early stages of spoken language processing that in turn might be
      related to specific reading difficulties. Subjects were required to detect
      prespecified targets under dichotic presentation of auditory nonword pairs. The
      stimuli were made such that segment migrations were possible. The potential
      contribution of phonetic features, as well as that of phonemes and syllables, was
      investigated. The results showed that dyslexics had specifically more
      syllable-based migrations. This result is discussed in the context of
      well-documented metaphonological deficits and memory problems of poor readers.

TI  - On the bases of two subtypes of developmental [corrected] dyslexia.
PG  - 157-95
AB  - This study examined whether there are different subtypes of developmental
      dyslexia. The subjects were 51 dyslexic children (reading below the 30th
      percentile in isolated word recognition), 51 age-matched normal readers, and 27
      younger normal readers who scored in the same range as the dyslexics on word
      recognition. Using methods developed by Castles and Coltheart (1993), we
      identified two subgroups who fit the profiles commonly termed "surface" and
      "phonological" dyslexia. Surface subjects were relatively poorer in reading
      exception words compared to nonwords; phonological dyslexics showed the opposite 
      pattern. However, most dyslexics were impaired on reading both exception words
      and nonwords compared to same-aged normal readers. Whereas the surface dyslexics'
      performance was very similar to that of younger normal readers, the phonological 
      dyslexics' was not. The two dyslexic groups also exhibited a double dissociation 
      on two validation tasks: surface subjects were impaired on a task involving
      orthographic knowledge but not one involving phonology; phonological dyslexics
      showed the opposite pattern. The data support the conclusion that there are at
      least two subtypes of developmental dyslexia. Although these patterns have been
      taken as evidence for the dual-route model, we provide an alternative account of 
      them within the Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) connectionist model. The
      connectionist model accounts for why dyslexics tend to be impaired on both
      exception words and nonwords; it also suggests that the subtypes may arise from
      multiple underlying deficits. We conclude that performance on exception words and
      nonwords is not sufficient to identify the basis of dyslexic behavior; rather,
      information about children's performance on other tasks, their remediation
      experiences, and the computational mechanisms that give rise to impairments must 
      be taken into account as well.

TI  - The nonword reading deficit in developmental dyslexia: evidence from children
      learning to read German.
PG  - 80-90
AB  - This study examined whether dyslexic children learning to read German show the
      same nonword reading deficit, which is characteristic of dyslexic children
      learning to read English (Rack, Olson, & Snowling, 1992), a deficit which is
      taken as evidence for a phonological impairment underlying dyslexia. Because the 
      German writing system, in contrast to English, exhibits comparatively simple and 
      straightforward grapheme-phoneme correspondences, the generality of the nonword
      reading deficit across different alphabetic systems seemed questionable.
      Actually, it was found that 10-year-old dyslexic children learning to read German
      exhibited rather high reading accuracy for nonwords when compared to that
      typically found among dyslexic children learning to read English. Nevertheless,
      the children learning German did exhibit a nonword reading deficit. Specifically,
      their speed for nonwords was impaired in relation to younger control
      (nondyslexic) children matched on reading speed for frequent words. This nonword 
      reading deficit was observed for nonwords with little similarity to existing
      German words as well as for nonwords which were analogous to short, frequent
      content words. It is hypothesized that dyslexic children learning German do not
      differ from dyslexic children learning English in their underlying phonological
      impairment, but that they do differ with respect to the expression of this
      impairment.

PG  - 521-8
AB  - This study explored the utility of using selected brain morphometric indices for 
      predicting group membership for children with developmental dyslexia (n = 10),
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: combined type (n = 10), and a control
      group (n = 10). Subjects ranged in age from 6.1 to 16 years (M = 10.5 years, SD =
      2.8). None of the subjects were diagnosed with mental retardation, nor did any of
      the subjects have a history of seizure disorder, head trauma, or other
      neurodevelopmental disorders. WISC-R Full Scale IQ ranged from 87 to 149 (M =
      114.4, SD = 13.3) with no significant differences noted between the clinical
      groups. Six brain regions, as defined by MRI scans, were selected a priori for
      inclusion in a discriminant function analysis. Reliability of the morphometric
      measures ranged from 0.94 to 0.97. One significant discriminant function was
      generated which accounted for about 61.4% of the variance between groups. The
      predictive discriminant analysis using the six morphometric MRI measurements
      classified subjects with an overall 60% accuracy with the best accuracy found for
      the developmental dyslexia and control groups. A predictive discriminant analysis
      incorporating these six morphometric measures as well as chronological age and
      FSIQ increased the overall classification accuracy to 87% with the misclassfied
      subjects assigned to one of the clinical groups. The findings support the
      presumed neurological basis for many neurodevelopmental disorders. They also
      underline the importance of including brain morphometric measures in predictive
      models.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia: prevalence and demographic features.
PG  - 25-33
AB  - One hundred and forty-three 11-year-old children with development dyscalculia,
      from a cohort of 3029 students, were studied to determine demographic features
      and prevalence of this primary cognitive disorder. They were evaluated for
      gender, IQ, linguistic and perceptual skills, symptoms of attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), socio-economic status and associated learned
      disabilities. The IQs of the 140 children (75 girls and 65 boys) retained in the 
      study group (three were excluded because of low IQs) ranged from 80 to 129 (mean 
      98.2, SD 9.9). 26 per cent of the children had symptoms of ADHD, and 17 per cent 
      had dyslexia. Their socio-economic status was significantly lower than that of
      the rest of the cohort, and 42 per cent had first-degree relatives with learning 
      disabilities. The prevalence of dyscalculia in the original cohort was 6.5 per
      cent, similar to that of dyslexia and ADHD. However, unlike these other learning 
      disabilities, dyscalculia affected the two sexes in about the same proportions.

TI  - Dyslexia: a validation of the concept at two age levels.
PG  - 102-12
AB  - The 144 participants were administered tasks with a demonstrated relationship to 
      reading. Both older students (8 to 10 years old) and younger students (6 to 7
      years old) included three groups of poor readers (matched on word reading but
      differing in the discrepancy from expected reading level) and age-matched average
      readers. Older poor readers also had a control group of reading-matched younger
      subjects. The study provided no support for the concept of dyslexia at age 6 to 7
      years. Among older participants there was support for the concept of dyslexia as 
      a phonological deficit and of nondiscrepant garden-variety poor reading as a
      developmental lag. More discrepant participants with dyslexia exhibited
      orthographic and serial naming-speed deficits, as well as phonological deficits, 
      and were a distinctive dyslexic group. Less discrepant participants with dyslexia
      were more similar to garden-variety poor readers than to the more discrepant
      participants with dyslexia.

TI  - Laterality and types of dyslexia.
PG  - 631-6
AB  - The right shift theory of handedness and cerebral specialization suggests that
      there is an underlying substrate of random lateral asymmetries in all higher
      animals and a specific factor in humans which increases the probability of left
      hemisphere advantage. The specific factor displaces the random distribution along
      a continuum of asymmetry in favour of the left hemisphere and the right hand. The
      distribution of handedness in families can be explained if the shift to
      dextrality depends on a single gene, rs +, when the frequency of the gene is
      estimated from the proportion of dysphasics with unilateral lesions of the left
      versus the right hemisphere. The gentoype proportions suggested a genetic
      balanced polymorphism with heterozygote advantage for laterality and ability.
      Application of the model to developmental dyslexia led to the hypothesis that
      both homozygotes (rs -- and rs ++ genotypes) are at risk for reading. The
      critical question was whether the type of cognitive problem differs as expected, 
      speech based processing for the rs -- and non-speech based for the rs ++. The
      former should include more left and mixed handers, while the latter should be
      more strongly dextral than controls. Evidence for this double dissociation
      between type of cognitive disability and type of handedness has been found in
      poor readers and in other samples.

AB  - Developmental dyslexia is a neurological syndrome of unknown origin. Historical, 
      conceptual, etiological, epidemiological aspects of developmental dyslexia are
      reviewed in a neuropsychological perspective. This article also reviews the known
      neuroanatomic, neuropathologic, and diagnostic basis of developmental dyslexia.
      Dislexic typology, with specific deficits in language, the visual domain or both,
      is discussed. Developmental dyslexia may be associated with several
      neuropsychological deficits. Its screening must be cognitively complete and
      according to accepted diagnostic criteria; a disorder manifested by difficulty in
      learning to read despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence, and
      sociocultural opportunity.

TI  - Family patterns of developmental dyslexia, part II: behavioral phenotypes.
PG  - 494-505
AB  - The motor control of bimanual coordination and motor speech was compared between 
      first degree relatives from families with at least 2 dyslexic family members, and
      families where probands were the only affected family members. Half of affected
      relatives had motor coordination deficits; and they came from families in which
      probands also showed impaired motor coordination. By contrast, affected relatives
      without motor deficits came from dyslexia families where probands did not have
      motor deficits. Motor coordination deficits were more common and more severe
      among affected offspring in families where both parents were affected than among 
      affected offspring in families where only one parent was affected. However, motor
      coordination deficits were also more common and more severe in affected parents
      when both parents were affected than among affected parents in families where
      only one parent was affected. We conclude that impaired temporal resolution in
      motor action identifies a behavioral phenotype in some subtypes of developmental 
      dyslexia. The observed pattern of transmission for motor deficits and reading
      impairment in about half of dyslexia families was most congruent with a genetic
      model of dyslexia in which 2 codominant major genes cosegregate in dyslexia
      pedigrees where the proband is also motorically impaired.

TI  - Absence of ear advantage on the consonant-vowel dichotic listening test in
      adolescent and adult dyslexics: specific auditory-phonetic dysfunction.
PG  - 833-40
AB  - The present study investigated auditory-phonetic processing in a group of
      adolescent and adult reading disabled subjects. Right- and left-handed dyslexic
      subjects were compared with an age, sex, and handedness matched control group.
      All subjects were studied with a consonant-vowel version of the dichotic
      listening task with repeated presentations of dichotically presented pairs of
      CV-syllables. Left and right ear correct scores were compared for ear advantage
      in each of the different subgroups of subjects. The main finding was the absence 
      of an expected right-ear advantage (REA) in the right-handed dyslexic group as
      compared to the right-handed normal readers. Both the dyslexic and normal
      left-handed groups did not show a REA. The findings are discussed within a
      theoretical framework that focuses on a basic auditory-phonetic processing
      dysfunction in developmental dyslexia that persists into adulthood.

TI  - The neuroprotective effects of MK-801 on the induction of microgyria by freezing 
      injury to the newborn rat neocortex.
PG  - 107-14
AB  - Four-layered microgyria is associated with many developmental disorders,
      including mental retardation, epilepsy, and developmental dyslexia. Freezing
      lesions to the newborn rodent neocortex result in the formation of four-layered
      microgyria. Previous research had suggested this type of injury acts as an
      hypoxic/ischemic event to the developing cortical plate. The current study
      examines the effectiveness of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
      antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) in protecting against freezing injury to the
      newborn rat cortical plate. Three groups of rats received freezing injury to the 
      cortical plate on the first day of life (postnatal day 1). Two groups were
      treated with MK-801 (1 or 2 mg/kg) 0.5 h before the lesion and 6 and 14 h after, 
      while one group received saline injections. A fourth group received MK-801
      injections, but did not have a freezing lesion. The volume of neocortical
      abnormality was determined for all three groups in rats killed after postnatal
      day 7. Treatment with the higher dose of MK-801 (3 x 2 mg/kg) dramatically
      reduced the effects of freezing injury but also resulted in over 50% mortality in
      both lesioned and unlesioned groups. Animals in the lesioned group, however, had 
      a decreased volume of abnormal cortex, and there were fewer animals with
      microsulci than in the untreated group. This is the first demonstration of a
      significant anatomical neuroprotective effect in newborns leading to a reduction 
      of cortical malformation.

      problems although they had normal levels of anxiety/depression. Significantly
      higher scores on all syndrome scales were found for DC children who had
      attentional problems in the clinical range. When associated with dyslexia and a
      low verbal IQ, DC children had more attentional problems and externalizing
      syndromes. The implications of the behavioral characteristics of DC are
      discussed.

TI  - Is there a visual deficit in dyslexia resulting from a lesion of the right
      posterior parietal lobe?
PG  - 513-7
AB  - Dyslexia has conventionally been attributed to a left hemisphere deficit
      affecting language skills. However, it has recently been suggested that
      two-thirds of dyslexic people have a lesion of the right posterior parietal lobe 
      (RPPL) resulting in poor oculo-motor control. It has been reported that
      neurological patients with RPPL lesions commonly manifest a neglect of the left
      side of space and this has also been described in clinical observations of
      'visual dyslexics'. We investigated this hypothesis with a sample of 53 dyslexic 
      children and 53 controls using a line-bisection task. In the horizontal test
      condition both groups tended to transect slightly to the left of the midpoint
      (mean displacement 0.14 mm for controls; 0.4 mm for dyslexics). The result
      suggests a small right side neglect which, contrary to one report in the
      literature, is found here in developmental dyslexics as well as controls, and
      leads to the conclusion that RPPL lesion is unlikely to be a common feature of
      dyslexia.

TI  - Brain potentials in developmental dyslexia: differential effects of word
      frequency in human subjects.
PG  - 183-6
AB  - The differences of word processing between a group of adult developmental
      dyslexics and control subjects were examined with the event-related potential
      (ERP) technique. In particular, the effects of word frequency and word
      recognition were assessed. The subjects viewed a series of frequently and
      infrequently used words, most of which were repeated after some intervening items
      and they discriminated between first and second presentations of the words. It
      can be shown that in the range from 300 to 550 ms post stimulus the amplitude of 
      the N400 component, an ERP measure of semantic processing, is reduced for high
      frequency words. This effect is more pronounced in the dyslexic group and the
      effects of word recognition are also reduced in the dyslexic group for high
      frequency words. These findings are discussed with respect to current concepts of
      dyslexia and of semantic processing.

TI  - Case study: corticosteroid treatment of language regression in pervasive
      developmental disorder.
PG  - 1107-11
AB  - The authors describe a child whose language and behavior regressed at 22 months
      and in whom pervasive developmental disorder was later diagnosed. At 6 years, he 
      displayed a profound receptive-expressive aphasia accompanied by behavioral
      disturbances characterized by hyperactivity, impaired social interactions,
      tantrums, gestural stereotypies, and echolalia. A single-photon emission computed
      tomography scan and steady-state auditory evoked potentials suggested bitemporal 
      and left frontal pathophysiology. The overall profile resembled Landau-Kleffner
      syndrome, but no electroencephalographic disturbance was evident. Corticosteroid 
      treatment resulted in amelioration of language abilities and behavior. These
      findings suggest that the factors underlying language regression in pervasive
      developmental disorder can, in special circumstances, be amenable to
      pharmacological treatment.

TI  - A dissociation between developmental surface and phonological dyslexia in two
      undergraduate students.
PG  - 909-14
AB  - This study compares the nature of the reading deficit that was observed in two
      dyslexic undergraduate students who were severely impaired at reading and
      spelling compared with normal undergraduates. They both achieved the same (below 
      average) score on the National Adult Reading Test and on the Schonell spelling
      test. One of them, however, was good at reading and spelling nonwords, had good
      phonological awareness skills, was better at reading regular than irregular
      words, and made phonologically accurate reading and spelling errors (i.e. was a
      surface dyslexic). The other had poor phonological awareness, produced relatively
      few phonologically accurate spelling errors, and was poor at reading and spelling
      nonwords (i.e. was a phonological dyslexic). It is particularly noteworthy that
      such a clear dissociation between surface and phonological forms of developmental
      dyslexia occurred in two subjects who were closely matched in terms of their
      overall reading and spelling ability, and also in terms of their memory span and 
      vocabulary. It is argued that this study strengthens the evidence for the
      existence of qualitatively different types of developmental dyslexia. The
      findings are also consistent with the view that phonological awareness skills are
      more closely related to the operation of the phonological rather than the visual 
      reading route.

      dysphasia.
PG  - 823-34
AB  - Hemisphere specialization for language was studied in 10 children with expressive
      developmental dysphasia (DD) (mean age 10 years 4 months) submitted to a dichotic
      listening task (in a word free-recall task and forced-attention task) and a
      finger tapping/vocalization dual-task paradigm. A nonsense shape dichaptic task
      was also introduced to control right hemispheric processing. Performances of
      dysphasic children were compared to those obtained from 15 normal children. The
      results showed that controls had a right ear advantage in free-recall (words)
      dichotic listening task and a significant right ear advantage in
      forced-right-attention task, with a change in ear asymmetry as a consequence of
      instruction. In the dysphasic group we observed a significant right ear advantage
      in the free-recall dichotic listening task and no change in ear asymmetry during 
      forced right or forced left condition. Results in time sharing paradigm and
      nonsense dichaptic task are more difficult to interpret, because there was no
      interaction between group and condition. These results cannot support a complete 
      left hemisphere dysfunction in developmental dysphasia.

TI  - Ischemic thalamic infarction in children: clinical presentation, etiology, and

PG  - 46-9
AB  - Clinical features of thalamic strokes have not been well delineated in children. 
      Six children with ischemic thalamic infarcts (3 M, 3 F; age range: 21 months to
      14 1/2 years) are reported. Three patients had infarction in the thalamoperforate
      artery territory and all had a decreased level of consciousness and hemiparesis; 
      two of them also had associated ocular motility abnormalities. One patient with
      left thalamotuberal artery stroke presented with aphasia. Two patients with
      thalamogeniculate artery infarcts had hemiparesis and involvement of the
      posterior cerebral artery. Etiologic factors in our patients were: infectious
      vasculitis, congenital heart disease, migraine, and unknown in 1 patient each and
      trauma in 2 patients. Follow-up information was available for 5, 4 of whom
      recovered completely. One patient was left with a neurologic deficit. We conclude
      that the prognosis of ischemic thalamic strokes in children is relatively good.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia and brain laterality.
PG  - 357-65
AB  - The correlation between arithmetic dysfunction and brain laterality was studied
      in 25 children with developmental dyscalculia (DD). The children were tested on a
      standardized arithmetic battery and underwent a neurological and
      neuro-psychological evaluation. A diagnosis of left hemisphere dysfunction (n =
      13) was based on right side soft neurological signs, performance IQ (PIQ) >
      verbal IQ (VIQ), dyslexia and intact visuo-spatial functions. The criteria for
      right hemisphere dysfunction (n = 12) were left body signs, VIQ > PIQ, impaired
      visuo-spatial functions and normal language skills. The groups were similar for
      age, gender, and socio-economic status. Our results showed that both groups
      scored more than 2 SD below the mean adjusted score on the arithmetic battery,
      but the left group was significantly worse in 3 areas: mastery of
      addition/subtraction, complex multiplication and division and visuo-spatial
      errors (p < 0.05). The data indicate that dysfunction of either hemisphere
      hampers arithmetic acquisition, but arithmetic impairment is more profound with
      left hemisphere dysfunction.

AB  - The development of two boys with the diagnosis of specific language impairment
      each of whom spoke only five words at the age of three is described through the
      third grade (regular school). In spite of similarities in nonverbal abilities and
      in conditions of therapy and general care the two children developed quite
      differently. One achieved an average language level by about age five, whereas
      the other seemed to stagnate from about this age on even though he made good
      progress in other areas. The author discusses the role of auditory perception,
      learning strategies, memory and behavior in the latter child's development.

TI  - Behavioral consequences of neonatal injury of the neocortex.
PG  - 177-89
AB  - Several strains of autoimmune mice spontaneously develop molecular layer ectopias
      that are similar in appearance to those seen in humans and are caused by
      disturbances in neocortical neuronal migration. These mice also exhibit
      behavioral anomalies, some of which correlate with ectopias, others with the
      immunological disorder. In this study, we induced neocortical ectopias (via
      puncture wounds) and microgyria (via freezing lesions) in the neocortex of
      1-day-old (newborn) mice without immune disorders in an attempt to further
      disentangle the effects of autoimmunity and of cortical malformation on behavior.
      In addition, we wished to compare the behavioral effects of small ectopias to
      larger microgyric lesions. DBA mice were assigned at birth to receive either a
      puncture wound or freezing lesion of either the left or right hemisphere. An
      independent group was subjected to sham surgery. In adulthood, these mice were
      given a battery of tests designed to measure lateralization and learning
      capacity. Lesioned mice (irrespective of hemisphere or type of damage) performed 
      poorly when compared to sham-operated animals in discrimination learning, in a
      spatial Morris Maze Match-to-Sample task, and in a Lashley Type III maze. In
      shuttlebox avoidance conditioning, where immunological disorder has been shown to
      compromise behavioral performance in autoimmune mice, there was no difference
      between lesioned and sham animals. These results (1) support the dissociation
      between the effects of developmental neocortical anomalies and autoimmune disease
      on behavior (2) reveal similarities between spontaneous and induced neocortical
      malformations and (3) fail to support a difference in behavioral effects between 
      ectopias and microgyria.

PG  - 1483-94
AB  - Development dyslexics perform differently from controls on a number of low level 
      visual tasks. We carried out three experiments to explore some of these
      differences. Dyslexics have been found to have reduced luminance contrast
      sensitivity at mesopic luminance levels. We failed to replicate this finding at
      photopic luminance levels. We also compared the (photopic) coherent motion
      detection thresholds of groups of child and adult dyslexics with those of age
      matched controls. Dyslexics were significantly less sensitive to motion. The
      results are discussed in relation to a recent suggestion that developmental
      dyslexia may be associated with a magnocellular visual deficit.

AB  - In this study 9 children (6 boys, 3 girls) with reading disabilities and specific
      difficulties in rapid serial naming were followed from age 9 years to age 18
      years. This group was taken from an earlier study sample of 82 third-grade
      children with learning disabilities. Tests of rapid serial naming, reading and
      spelling, general intelligence, articulation speed, and word fluency were
      administered to the subjects and to a matched control group (n = 10) in the
      initial study (at age 9) and in the present follow-up study (at age 18). The
      results showed that difficulties in both rapid naming and reading and spelling
      persisted into early adulthood in this subgroup. The development of naming speed 
      is discussed in terms of a deficit model versus a developmental lag model of
      learning disability.

PG  - 66-79
AB  - Cognitive remediation of decoding deficit was attempted by following a
      theoretically based program. The theory identifies four major cognitive
      processes: Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive (PASS) processing.
      The PASS Remedial Program (PREP) provides 10 structured tasks that are aimed at
      developing internalized strategies for mainly successive processes (6 tasks) and 
      simultaneous process (4 tasks); deficits in either of the two may lead to poor
      decoding. Through its "global process" training and curriculum-related "bridging"
      training, PREP facilitates application of internalized strategies arrived at
      inductively for learning word decoding and spelling; it does not provide direct
      teaching of rules or exercises. To test the efficacy of PREP, we divided 51
      children with decoding difficulties in Grade 4 into two groups: PREP (both global
      and bridging) and no treatment. In the second part of the study, children from
      the no-treatment group received either the global or the bridging part of PREP.
      The relative efficacy of training was tested by pre-, and posttests of
      performance on a standard word-decoding test (the WRMT-R), as well as on some
      cognitive tests (e.g., the CAS). The largest improvement in word decoding
      occurred for the PREP combined global and bridging treatment. The mechanism
      through which PREP improves word reading is discussed, as is the use of PREP for 
      children at risk of developing dyslexia.

      paroxysmal EEG activity during sleep.
PG  - 14-8
AB  - In order to clarify the relationship between developmental dysphasia and EEG
      abnormalities, paroxysmal activities during sleep were studied in a series of 24 
      children with expressive developmental dysphasia (mean age 8 years) and compared 
      to a control group of 39 children (mean age 9 years). The children of both groups
      were selected excluding cases with prior history of neurological disease or
      epilepsy. In the control group, 37 children had normal sleep EEG while 2 children
      had paroxysmal abnormalities. In the dysphasic group, epileptic abnormalities
      were observed in 9 cases, rare in 4 cases and frequent in 5 cases (density: 2.5
      to 66.2% of total sleep time). Nevertheless, paroxysmal abnormalities did not
      reach the frequency described in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and it is unlikely
      that EEG abnormalities could have produced dysphasia.

TI  - Time estimation deficits in developmental dyslexia: evidence of cerebellar
      involvement.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - In addition to their language-related difficulties, dyslexic children suffer
      problems in motor skill, balance, automatization and speeded performance. Given
      the recent evidence for cerebellar involvement in the acquisition of language
      fluency, these problems suggest cerebellar deficit. To test the hypothesis of
      cerebellar dysfunction in dyslexia, a time estimation task considered to be a
      sensitive index of cerebellar function was administered to matched groups of
      dyslexic and control children. The dyslexic children showed the predicted deficit
      on time estimation (among the most severe obtained in our research programme) but
      not on a control, loudness estimation, task. Cerebellar dysfunction, therefore,
      provides a parsimonious account of otherwise disparate data on deficits in
      dyslexia.

TI  - Dyslexia and corpus callosum morphology.
PG  - 32-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is evolving evidence that developmental dyslexia is associated
      with anomalous cerebral morphology in the bilateral frontal and left
      temporoparietal regions. This study examined the morphology of the corpus
      callosum, as possible deviations in other important structures are poorly
      understood in this behaviorally diagnosed syndrome. DESIGN: Magnetic resonance
      imaging scans were obtained from children with developmental dyslexia and from
      matched control children. Morphometric measurements were examined to determine if
      regional differences existed in the corpus callosum between these two groups of
      children. SETTING: Magnetic resonance imaging studies were completed at Athens
      (Ga) Magnetic Imaging. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen developmental
      dyslexic children (mean age, 9.7 years) and a matched sample of children who were
      diagnosed as being normal were examined by using a reliable comprehensive
      diagnostic process. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using a midsagittal magnetic resonance
      imaging scan, corpus callosum morphology was evaluated by segmenting the corpus
      callosum into five regions of interest. RESULTS: Analysis of the corpus callosum 
      revealed that the anterior region of interest (the genu) was significantly
      smaller in the dyslexic children. Significant correlations existed between
      reading achievement and the region-of-interest measurements for the genu and
      splenium. Measured intelligence, chronologic age, and gender were not related to 
      region-of-interest measurements of the corpus callosum. Consistent with previous 
      studies, the dyslexic individuals were characterized by significant psychiatric
      comorbidity, particularly attention-deficit disorder with and without
      hyperactivity. Reported familial left-handedness also distinguished the dyslexic 
      children. CONCLUSIONS: Subtle neurodevelopmental variation in the morphology of
      the corpus callosum may be associated with the difficulty that dyslexic children 
      experience in reading and on tasks involving interhemispheric transfer.

AB  - For several years, investigators have been examining the relationship between
      learning difficulties and a variety of immunological disorders. Two recent
      studies by Hansen and colleagues reported a negative association between Type 1
      diabetes and reading disabilities (dyslexia): subjects with Type 1 diabetes had a
      lower prevalence of dyslexia than their nondiabetic relatives. In order to
      control for the impact of environmental variables on learning, we investigated
      the relationship between Type 1 diabetes and learning problems in 27 sibling
      pairs, ranging in age from 6 to 20 years. One child in each pair had Type 1
      diabetes, and the other child was the unaffected sibling closest in age. Children
      were assessed for cognitive skills, academic achievement in reading, mathematics,
      and written language, as well as for speech articulation and motor coordination. 
      Other variables that were examined included handedness, behavioural variables,
      medical history, and pregnancy and birth complications. We found no significant
      differences between the 27 children with Type 1 diabetes and their unaffected
      siblings on any of the cognitive, academic achievement, or speech articulation
      measures. There were also no significant differences on handedness, behavioural
      variables, or health history.

PG  - S120-6
AB  - The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has been and will
      continue to be, responsive to the critical research needs in learning
      disabilities and related disorders. As an index of the heightened research
      activity in this arena, consider that National Institute of Child Health and
      Human Development's support for projects related to learning and language
      disabilities has increased from 1.75 million dollars in 1975 to over 15 million
      dollars in 1993--a cumulative total of approximately 80 million dollars. Given
      the significant discoveries made by the program projects, learning disability
      research centers, and individual research grants supported through these
      increases, the money clearly has been well spent. Within the past 10 years,
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development research programs have
      identified the major cognitive mechanisms underlying dyslexia and other learning 
      disabilities and how the assessment of these mechanisms can help to predict the
      onset, developmental course, and outcomes of such disorders. Moreover, scientists
      supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have
      contributed substantially to an understanding of how genes, the brain, and the
      environment interact to produce individual variations in learning. Given this
      knowledge, we are hopeful that the newly funded treatment/intervention projects
      will provide guidance with respect to ameliorating the devastating effects of
      learning disabilities on both children and adults.

AB  - Two groups of pupils from special tract learning schools were randomly selected
      for this study. The first group (55 pupils) fulfilled the World Federation of
      Neurology (WFN) definition of developmental dyslexia (DD). The second group
      (retarded readers, RR) included 20 pupils with IQs between 80 and 90. A group of 
      normal readers was randomly selected from the 5 school grades as a control group.
      This study showed that the performance IQ of the DD group was not only higher
      than the verbal IQ, but the DD group also had superior performance IQ compared to
      normal readers. In the arithmetic achievement test, both DD and RR groups had
      nearly similar total scores, which were significantly lower than that of the
      control group. None of the arithmetic subtests could differentiate between DD and
      RR groups. In linguistic achievement tests, only spontaneous writing and oral
      spelling could differentiate subjects with DD from the RR group.

TI  - Attentional control over language lateralization in dyslexic children: deficit or
      delay?
PG  - 39-51
AB  - Two previous verbal dichotic studies by Kershner and Morton (Neuropsychologia 28,
      181-198, 1990) using the forced-attention methodology (Bryden, Strategies of
      Information Processing, Academic Press, London, 1978) demonstrated that the order
      in which the ears were monitored (LE first or RE first) determined whether
      learning disabled children compared to age-matched nondisabled children were more
      weakly or strongly lateralized. The same technique was used with the addition of 
      controls for lateral head and eye movements, specific diagnostic criteria to
      include only phonological dyslexics, IQ and reading level. Dyslexic vs
      age-matched comparisons replicated the previous studies. The dyslexics produced a
      weaker REA in the LE first order but a greater number of subjects with a REA in
      the RE first order. Reading-matched comparisons suggested that the order-specific
      reduced REA in the dyslexics may reflect a causal deficit of the disorder,
      whereas the order-specific increase in the number of dyslexic subjects with a REA
      was no different than the reading-matched group, implicating a developmental
      delay. The results suggest that children with dyslexia may suffer from a primary 
      attentional impairment in altering the REA. This implicates an underlying
      difficulty of flexible verbal processing in response to the rapidly changing
      cognitive requirements of reading.

AB  - There is no consensus opinion on whether or not cognitive impairments are found
      in the Silver-Russell syndrome. An investigation of a substantial sample was
      undertaken, using standardised assessments, in 20 boys and five girls aged 6.0
      years to 11.8 years. Mean (SD) birth weights were -2.65 (0.95) SD scores,
      corrected for gestation. At evaluation the children had a mean (SD) age of 8.8
      (1.8) years and a mean height of -2.26 (1.5) SD scores. Tests of cognitive
      abilities included assessments of general intelligence, reading and arithmetic
      attainments, and a cognitive processing task. Most had some degree of
      developmental delay: mean (SD) full scale IQ was 86 (24); 32% scored within the
      learning disability range (that is, IQ < 70); 40% were reading at least 24 months
      below their chronological age. Current head circumference correlated highly with 
      full scale IQ. Assessments of special educational needs had been completed on
      36%; 48% were receiving speech therapy. Approximately half of children with the
      Silver-Russell syndrome have significant impairment of their cognitive abilities.

TI  - Auditory event-related potentials, dichotic listening performance and handedness 
      as indices of lateralisation in dyslexic and normal readers.
PG  - 265-75
AB  - Evidence suggests that children with developmental dyslexia have poor
      phonological processing skills, are less likely to show lateralised activation
      during the processing of verbal information than children with normal reading
      ability and tend towards the left of the handedness continuum. The present study 
      investigated this relationship between cerebral lateralisation and reading
      ability in children with and without dyslexia, directly using a dichotic
      listening paradigm with contemporaneous recording of auditory evoked potentials
      and indirectly using measures of hand preference and hand skill. The two groups
      were significantly different on a phonemic awareness task, particularly with
      reference to rime rather than phoneme onset. The two groups performed equally
      well on the dichotic listening task. However, normal readers produced
      significantly greater N100 amplitudes in the left temporal region during dichotic
      listening than the dyslexics who displayed approximately equivalent levels of
      amplitude bilaterally. In terms of hand preference the dyslexics were
      significantly less right-hand preferent than the controls, although the groups
      did not differ on a measure of right/left hand skill. The AEP lateralisation
      indices and the hand preference scores were significantly related to phonemic
      awareness performance. The different patterns of AEP activity produced by the two
      groups of children during the dichotic listening task and the differences in hand
      preference may be related to abnormal cerebral lateralisation of language
      functions. The failure of the dichotic listening task to discriminate between the
      two groups in spite of evidence of differences in cortical activation suggests
      that the processing difficulties which may be indexed by these differences in
      cortical activation affect the reading process at a later stage than that tapped 
      by dichotic listening.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia, neural timing and hemispheric lateralisation.
PG  - 241-9
AB  - Approximately 5% of 8-10-year-olds experience exceptional difficulties learning
      to read (developmental dyslexia). This usually has a congenital basis; it runs in
      families, and affects 4 times as many boys as girls. Dyslexics typically show
      impairment both in phonemic segmentation (the subdivision of speech beyond the
      natural syllabic level) and in sequencing small visual symbols. Both these skills
      draw upon the ability of the nervous system to time sensory events precisely. A
      specific magnocellular cell type which expresses a distinctive surface antigen
      plays a crucial role in these functions. The development of this cell line is
      probably congenitally impaired in dyslexics. Visually they have lowered flicker
      and motion sensitivity, and disorder of the magnocellular layers of the Lateral
      Geniculate Nucleus can be seen post mortem. Likewise they have lowered
      sensitivity to changes in frequency and amplitude of sounds, hence impaired
      discrimination of speech sounds. These disorders are associated with abnormal
      hemispheric lateralisation in these subjects, e.g. dyslexics show reduction or
      reversal of the usual left > right asymmetry of the planum temporale. Many of
      these characteristics of impaired magnocellular function and reversed hemispheric
      asymmetry are found not only in dyslexic children but also in developmental
      dysphasics, autistics, high schizotypes and schizophrenics. I will speculate
      therefore that normal magnocellular development promotes normal hemispheric
      asymmetry and that impaired magnocellular development is responsible for a
      spectrum of problems associated with impaired hemispheric specialisation, ranging
      from the mildest, dyslexia, to the most severe, schizophrenia.

      compared to control subjects.

TI  - Evaluating the empirical support for the Geschwind-Behan-Galaburda model of
      cerebral lateralization.
PG  - 103-67
AB  - The Geschwind-Behan-Galaburda (GBG) model of cerebral lateralization provides a
      complex but testable theory of the origins and associates of cerebral
      lateralization. An overall evaluation of the model suggest that it is not well
      supported by empirical evidence and that in the case of several key theoretical
      areas, the evidence that does exist is inconsistent with the theory. In
      particular: the concept of "anomalous dominance" is shown to be theoretically and
      methodologically flawed; a meta-analysis of the relationship between handedness
      and immune disorders finds a marginal overall association, and while three
      conditions (allergies, asthma, and ulcerative colitis) do show significant
      associations with left-handedness, two other conditions (myasthenia gravis and
      arthritis) show significant negative associations with left-handedness. Finally, 
      a review of the origins of the neural crest, and its associations, suggests there
      is almost no empirical support for the GBG theoretical model in this area.

TI  - Word recognition in developmental dyslexia: a connectionist interpretation.
PG  - 895-916
AB  - We present a study of the accuracy, consistency, and speed of word naming in a
      dyslexic boy, JM, who has severe impairments in the ability to use sub-lexical,
      phonological reading strategies. For words that he can recognise, JM's naming
      latencies do not differ from those of control subjects matched for reading age,
      and he is generally consistent from one occasion to the next. He can also match
      printed homophones with their definitions--a skill that requires access to
      well-specified orthographic representations. The data are interpreted as evidence
      for the creation of efficient recognition devices for words within JM's sight
      vocabulary. However, he shows a continuing inability to use phonological decoding
      strategies to deal with words that he cannot recognize by sight. Overall we argue
      our results pose problems for stage models of reading development, and that they 
      may best be interpreted within a connectionist framework of the development of
      word recognition skills.

TI  - [Short term memory and severe language disorders in the child].
PG  - 550-2
AB  - Memory, and particularly short-term memory or "working memory" (Baddeley), is
      involved in language acquisition in children. We have studied short-term memory, 
      with verbal-and non verbal tests, of 8 children suffering from developmental
      dysphasia compared with other ones, matched in terms of age and performance I.Q. 
      (W.I.S.C.-R.). The digit span did not significantly differ in the two groups,
      while the visuo-spatial span was lower in the dysphasic group. The memorization
      of a list of monosyllabic words by dysphasic children was poor in the absence of 
      visual presentation and improved by it. Differences between dysphasic and
      control-children are unlikely to be due to speech rate which does not
      significantly differ from one group to the other one. The results suggest the
      existence, in language disordered children, of cognitive functions disorders much
      more important than those directly involved in the speech production.

      strategies].
PG  - 534-6
AB  - A surprisingly small amount of information exists about early symptoms of
      learning disorders becoming evident during the first years at school. Only one
      relation seems to carry some degree of reliability: Early language deficits
      and/or retardation of language acquisition and later learning disorders including
      dyslexia. Because of these limitations, a more pragmatic approach is recommended.
      Questionnaires can be used asking for specific and age-related skills, involving 
      the existence and good functioning of strategically working and concept-building 
      central structures. Children with deficits in these structures will develop and
      experience dysfunctions in their cognitive, social and motor abilities.
      Consequently, they present behavioural problems. Children whose questionnaires
      offer suspicion in respect of specific dysfunctions should be tested by means of 
      structured play tests or by appropriate developmental tests, to determine their
      individual patterns of talents and specific shortcomings. An early therapeutic
      intervention, aimed at the child's specific and individual deficits, may prevent 
      or reduce learning problems at school.

TI  - Effect of Alzheimer's disease on communication function.
PG  - 417-23
AB  - Dementia has a significant impact on communication abilities. The profile of
      communication skills in dementia differ from the profiles of developmental aging 
      and focal organic disorders. Normal elders may have some episodic memory losses
      and slower reaction times as aging progresses. Focal language disorders (aphasia 
      and right hemisphere disorders) will affect specific language functions without
      affecting intellect and memory. Communication in the presence of dementia
      progresses through three stages. The first stage deficits are primarily in the
      content area of lexical access and subtle conversational skills. The second stage
      reveals increased difficulty in content areas including concept formation,
      lexical access diminished graphic abilities, reliance on syntactic abilities and 
      reduced memory function. The third stage of dementia may involve all of the above
      to a more severe degree, with severe memory and intellectual deficits. Assessment
      batteries have been developed to evaluate the deficit areas frequently associated
      with communication in dementia. Clinical evaluation and standardized assessment
      can differentiate the language profile of dementia from other neurological
      disorders. Therapeutic intervention in communication focuses on maintaining the
      patient's communication and providing educational information for caregivers for 
      more effective communication strategies.

TI  - Evidence for aberrant auditory anatomy in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 8010-3
AB  - Abnormal auditory processing in dyslexics suggests that accompanying anatomical
      abnormalities might be present in the auditory system. Therefore, we measured
      cross-sectional neuronal areas in the medial geniculate nuclei (MGNs) of five
      dyslexic and seven control brains. In contrast to controls, which showed no
      asymmetry, the left-side MGN neurons were significantly smaller than the right in
      the dyslexic sample. Also, as compared with controls, there were more small
      neurons and fewer large neurons in the left dyslexic MGN. These findings are
      consistent with reported behavioral findings of a left hemisphere-based
      phonological defect in dyslexic individuals.

PG  - 171-80
AB  - A prior study documented the failure of dyslexic men to activate left
      temporoparietal cortex during phonologic processing. Because of reports of an
      anomalous right planum temporale in developmental dyslexia, the functional
      implications of which are unknown, this study examined the ability of dyslexics
      to activate right temporal cortex. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in
      15 right-handed dyslexic men during rest and during a tonal memory task expected 
      to activate right-sided cortex in controls. A matched control sample (n = 18)
      showed significant activation of several right frontotemporal regions as well as 
      of left temporal cortex. In contrast, severely dyslexic men activated fewer right
      frontotemporal regions, while making many more errors than controls, but showed
      normal activation of left mid to anterior temporal cortex. These results support 
      hypothesized underlying deficits in rapid temporal processing and possible
      involvement of right (in addition to left) temporal cortex in severe dyslexia.

TI  - Interhemispheric balance patterns detected by selective phonemic dichotic
      laterality measures in four clinical subtypes of reading-disabled children.
PG  - 556-67
AB  - Identifying disabilities in word-attack, word-recognition, or reading
      comprehension, allowed for four categories of reading disability: (1) reading
      comprehension only (RC), (2) word-attack plus comprehension (WA+RC), (3)
      word-attack, word-recognition, and comprehension (WA+WR+RC), and (4) word-attack 
      but not comprehension (WA-RC). Along with age-matched controls (AMC) and
      developmental-delay controls (DDC), the disabled were tested on a
      directed-attention dichotic task using consonant-vowel combinations. Laterality
      results for each place of articulation (i.e., bilabial, alveolar, and velar)
      selectively attested to greater left hemisphere involvement or engagement for the
      RC group and greater right hemisphere involvement or engagement for the WA+RC
      group. Performance of the other two disabled groups was consistent with less
      efficient right hemisphere involvement or callosal transfer. Implications for
      theory, research, and remediation are discussed.

TI  - A new classification of developmental language disorders (DLD).
PG  - 96-116
AB  - Eighty children with DLD were examined with 18 language tests, mainly derived
      from a neuropsychological investigation called NEPSY (NEuroPSYchological
      Investigation for Children). The children were 6-0 to 7-9 years old and attended 
      kindergarten. The test profiles of the first 40 children, Group 1, were utilized 
      for the elaboration of a classification of DLD. The test profiles were grouped
      into five subgroups with the aid of a Q-type factor analysis. Then the
      classification was modified to suit clinical application by collapsing two pairs 
      of subgroups. The resulting categories were called: the Global Subtype, the
      Specific Dyspraxia Subtype, and the Specific Comprehension Subtype. The
      classification was validated, first, by a follow-up study. It was predicted that 
      spelling problems would occur in the Global and the Specific Comprehension
      Subtypes, but not in the Specific Dyspraxia Subtype. At follow-up, 3 years later,
      the hit rate was found to be 80.5%. In a second validation procedure, the
      classification was tried out on the 40 children examined later, Group 2. The
      coverage of the classification was 85%. Five outliers (12.5%) seemed to form a
      fourth category, called the Specific Dysnomia Subtype. An expressive subtype was 
      not observed.

TI  - Dichotic listening performance under high and low lexical work load in subtypes
      of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 757-85
AB  - This study examined dichotic listening performance in different subtypes of
      developmental dyslexia under high and low verbal work load conditions. Free
      recall tests of digits and words were administered to 320 dyslexic children from 
      grade 3 to grade 10 and their matched controls. Results indicate significant
      differences within subtypes. Surface dyslexics manifested extreme ear neglect or 
      total performance collapse but only under high verbal work load conditions.
      Phonological dyslexia was distinguished by poor total performance both under high
      and low work load levels. Visuo-motor dyslexics, however, did not differ in any
      measure from their controls. These results lend support to the contention that
      the main neuropsychological factor impeding reading acquisition varies according 
      to dyslexia subtype.

      indices of information processing.
PG  - 386-401
AB  - Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from a group of 13 men with
      severe developmental dyslexia and 15 matched normal controls. Auditory and visual
      stimuli, presented in separate reaction time tasks of graded difficulty, were
      used to elicit ERPs. No group differences in P300 were seen under relatively
      undemanding task conditions. However, as task demands increased, visual P300 was 
      reduced in the dyslexic men as compared with the normal readers. An Abbreviated
      Conners Parent Rating Scale was used to assess retrospectively childhood symptoms
      of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Additional analyses revealed 
      that the dyslexics with a history of many symptoms of ADHD in childhood (high
      ADHD) accounted for the group differences in P300; the dyslexics with a history
      of few or no such symptoms (low ADHD) were indistinguishable from the controls at
      all electrode sites. Furthermore, whereas the low-ADHD dyslexics showed the same 
      hemispheric asymmetry in auditory P300 as did the controls (right > left),
      auditory P300 was more symmetrically distributed in the high-ADHD dyslexics. The 
      results are interpreted as suggesting that a distinct brain organization may
      characterize dyslexic men with a history of concomitant deficits in attention.

TI  - Family patterns of developmental dyslexia: clinical findings.
PG  - 122-31
AB  - Two separate groups of dyslexia families were ascertained through probands
      attending special schools for dyslexic students. An additional control group of
      families was ascertained through randomly selected students attending public
      schools. The 3 groups were interviewed by questionnaire about the family's
      demographic characteristics, and about the incidence of reading and spelling
      disorders in all first and second order relatives. One group of dyslexia families
      was also examined by standardized intelligence and academic achievement tests.
      Developmental dyslexia was found to aggregate in families; there were 4-5 times
      as many affected males as females among clinically identified students attending 
      the special schools, but the sex ratio of affected relatives after probands had
      been excluded was approximately 1.4 males for every female. Sibs were at greater 
      risk for reading difficulties when one parent was affected than when neither
      parent was affected. Sibs were also at greater risk for academic difficulties,
      and affected sibs were more severely impaired, when the father rather than the
      mother was the affected parent. In dyslexia families with 2 affected parents, the
      sibs were at greater risk, and the affected sibs were more severely impaired,
      than in families where only one parent was affected. Moreover, in families with 2
      affected parents, both of the parents were more severely impaired in reading and 
      spelling than parents of the same sex in families with one affected parent. Some 
      indirect evidence is presented that assortative mating may codetermine patterns
      of affectedness in dyslexia families.

PG  - 613-48
AB  - Early developmental language delay is characterized by slow development of
      language in preschoolers. The condition is frequent among two- and
      three-year-olds, causes concern among parents, and generates differences of
      opinion as to significance among informed professionals. Poorer long-term
      outcomes are much more likely if language delay persists until the later
      preschool years, and if the delay is not specific to language and/or includes
      problems in understanding. Specific language delay in the preschool period is
      better characterized as a risk factor than a disorder; most children with
      specific language delay recover to the normal range by five years of age.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia and animal studies: at the interface between cognition and
      neurology.
PG  - 133-49
AB  - Recent findings in autopsy studies, neuroimaging, and neurophysiology indicate
      that dyslexia is accompanied by fundamental changes in brain anatomy and
      physiology, involving several anatomical and physiological stages in the
      processing stream, which can be attributed to anomalous prenatal and immediately 
      postnatal brain development. Epidemiological evidence in dyslexic families led to
      the discovery of animal models with immune disease, comparable anatomical changes
      and learning disorders, which have added needed detail about mechanisms of injury
      and plasticity to indicate that substantial changes in neural networks concerned 
      with perception and cognition are present. It is suggested that the disorder of
      language, which is the cardinal finding in dyslexic subjects, results from early 
      perceptual anomalies that interfere with the establishment of normal
      cognitive-linguistic structures, coupled with primarily disordered cognitive
      processing associated with developmental anomalies of cortical structure and
      brain asymmetry. This notion is supported by electrophysiological data and by
      findings of anatomical involvement in subcortical structures close to the input
      as well as cortical structures involved in language and other cognitive
      functions. It is not possible at present to determine where the initial insult
      lies, whether near the input or in high-order cortex, or at both sites
      simultaneously.

PG  - 131-46
AB  - The performance of poor and average readers on cognitive tasks comprising naming 
      time, speech rate, and word series recall and on a phonemic segmentation task was
      examined in the first part of this study by computing relationships among the
      tasks and their relation to reading. In the second part of this study, we
      investigated the performance of the poor and average readers in detail on naming 
      time by analyzing the audiotaped protocols on a computer equipped with a sound
      system and an analysis program. The subjects were third- and fourth-grade
      students. Results showed that naming time and speech rate were dependable
      measures of phonological coding skills and were better predictors of word
      decoding than were phonemic segmentation and word recall. Poor readers were
      slower in each of the six rows of the naming-time task, and they paused longer
      between the rows. A need for studying the development of the cognitive skills
      along with word decoding is discussed.

TI  - Cognitive patterns of children with dyslexia: a comparison between groups with
      high and average nonverbal intelligence.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that children with dyslexia identified by word decoding 
      deficit will be poor in specific cognitive processes that require successive
      processing and rapid articulation, irrespective of their high or average
      nonverbal IQ. Children with dyslexia and normally achieving children between 9
      years and 11 years of age were divided into four groups comprising average-IQ and
      high-IQ children with dyslexia and normal readers. All children were administered
      measures of planning, attention-arousal, simultaneous and successive processes,
      phonemic segmentation, and nonverbal IQ. Results confirmed the hypothesis: The
      cognitive tasks that differentiated children with dyslexia from nondyslexic
      children irrespective of IQ were the successive tasks, as well as two tasks of
      attention that required articulation and/or phonological coding. Tasks that
      demanded both phonological coding and articulation correctly classified children 
      with dyslexia and nondyslexic children up to 80%. The importance of remedial
      training appropriate for alleviating the cognitive and word decoding deficits is 
      discussed.

TI  - Asymmetries in the superior temporal lobe in male and female first-episode
      schizophrenic patients: measures of the planum temporale and superior temporal
      gyrus by MRI.
PG  - 19-28
AB  - Schizophrenia has been hypothesized to be associated with an underlying brain
      developmental anomaly, specifically affecting normal brain asymmetries. The most 
      pronounced asymmetries are present on the superior surface of the temporal lobes,
      the left plane, as measured along the sylvian fissure (planum temporale) being
      longer than the right in the majority of normal individuals. These asymmetries
      encompass Wernicke's area, the anatomical substrate for language, and have been
      found to be less pronounced in individuals with developmental language problems, 
      i.e. dyslexia. Since disordered language is one of the hallmarks of
      schizophrenia, the present study focuses on the planum temporale and related
      superior temporal gyrus. Eighty-five first-episode schizophrenic patients and 40 
      controls had measurements of the sylvian fissure taken from coronal slices. The
      pattern of asymmetry in controls was for the right length to be longer than the
      left in anterior slices, and for left to be longer than right in posterior slices
      (corresponding to the planum temporale). Schizophrenic patients as a group
      demonstrated less asymmetry (R > L) in anterior slices, and female patients
      showed a trend for less (L > R) asymmetry in posterior slices. In contrast to the
      report of Barta et al. (1990), the volume of the anterior superior temporal gyrus
      did not differ from controls in first-episode schizophrenic patients. Neither the
      presence of formal thought disorder nor auditory hallucinations defined a
      subgroup of patients with reduced size or lateralization of the planum temporal
      or superior temporal gyrus.

TI  - MRI of Joubert's syndrome.
PG  - 30-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report five cases of the rare Joubert's syndrome. SUBJECTS: All
      five cases were studied by 1.0-Tesla MRI. All the patients showed typical
      clinical manifestations of Joubert's syndrome including neonatal respiratory
      abnormalities, developmental delay, ataxia, retinal atrophy and nystagmus.
      RESULTS: The T1WI of MRI showed characteristic MRI features of Joubert's syndrome
      including dilatation of the fourth ventricle with some appearing bat-wing shaped,
      elongation and stretching of the superior cerebellar peduncles, dysphasia of the 
      vermis, widening of the foramen of Magendie and the posterior cistern. One case
      was associated with encephalomeningocele. CONCLUSIONS: MRI can provide
      characteristic findings of Joubert's syndrome and confirm the clinical diagnosis.

TI  - Abnormal regional CBF response in left hemisphere of dysphasic children during a 
      language task.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - This study used xenon 133 inhalation and single-photon computed tomography to
      measure regional cerebral blood flow during a quiet resting condition, a simple
      auditory task, and an auditory phonemic discrimination task in 3 age-matched
      groups of children suffering from developmental language disabilities: expressive
      dysphasia, expressive-receptive dysphasia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder. An absence of left hemisphere activation was observed in the
      expressive-receptive group during the phonemic discrimination task as compared to
      both expressive and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder children, together
      with an absence of left inferior parietal region activation in dysphasics as
      compared to hyperactive children. These results favor the hypothesis of an
      abnormal lateralization for language in dysphasic children and point toward
      possible different pathologic localizations in the different clinical subtypes of
      dysphasia.

TI  - Standard EEG and dyslexia in children--new evidence for specific correlates?
PG  - 209-18
AB  - Contrary to the current assumption that there are no specific correlates of
      dyslexia in the standard clinical EEG, we have often noted a spontaneous
      "intermittent left parietal alpha desynchronization" (ILPAD) when visually
      evaluating the standard EEGs of children with delayed speech and language
      development and/or dyslexia. Visual evaluations of EEGs, as well as
      computer-assisted frequency analysis of three pairs of matched groups (healthy
      and hyperkinetic children with vs. without relatively "low levels" of verbal
      performance, as well as children with other child psychiatric disorders with vs. 
      without dyslexia), revealed that healthy children did not display the ILPAD
      phenomenon. It was seen neither in healthy children with a homogeneous
      performance profile ("high level" of verbal performance) nor in those with a
      relatively "low level" of verbal performance. However, the ILPAD phenomenon was
      evident mainly in children with psychiatric disorders who suffered from dyslexia.
      Its intermittent occurrence prevented its detection by means of the usual
      computer-supported analyses of EEG power spectra. Nevertheless, auditory
      cognitive loading was accompanied by a decrease in alpha power in both healthy
      and hyperkinetic children with "high" or "low" levels of verbal performance. In a
      further group of 8-year-old children with dyslexia, but otherwise healthy, the
      ILPAD phenomenon was also observed if their CNS maturation as reflected in the
      EEG was normal for their age. These results seemed to indicate at least a
      deficit-specificity of the ILPAD phenomenon, which is interpreted as an
      electrophysiological correlate of a "brain-electrical developmental deviation"
      with regard to the "functions of communication": speech, language, reading and
      spelling.

TI  - Children with specific reading retardation--early determinants and long-term
      outcome.
PG  - 229-37
AB  - In a prospective epidemiological longitudinal study of children (n = 399) from
      age 8 to 18 years, children with specific reading retardation (n = 37) were
      identified by the modified Research Diagnostic Criteria of ICD-10. The group with
      specific reading retardation was compared with a group with other specific
      developmental disorders (n = 62), a group of children with normal intelligence (n
      = 285) and a group of children with below average intelligence (n = 15). No
      correlation was found between reading retardation and pre- and perinatal
      complications. Children with reading retardation suffered from
      environment-related stress factors in early childhood and adverse familial
      conditions at 8 years and the educational level of the mother was significantly
      lower. The number of additional psychiatric symptoms was increased at ages 8, 13 
      and 18. Conduct disorders, in particular, were more frequent in children with
      specific reading retardation and the rate of juvenile delinquency was increased
      (25%). The non-verbal intelligence remained constant between ages 8 and 13, and
      spelling performance developed parallel to the control group with normal
      intelligence. Only one out of three showed a significant improvement in spelling 
      ability.

TI  - Dental management of the child with developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - Dyslexia, a biologically determined reading disorder effects an estimated 3
      percent to 10 percent of school-age children in the United States. Standard
      pediatric dental protocols frequently have to be modified because many of these
      children concurrently suffer attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
      asthma, thyroiditis and inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease). Youngsters suffering from dyslexia and ADHD should have their
      dental appointments scheduled in the morning when they are most attentive and
      best able to remain seated in the dental chair. An aspirating dental syringe must
      be used in order to avoid an intravascular injection and the possibility of an
      adverse interaction between the pressor agents used with local anesthesia and the
      medication used to treat ADHD. Aspirin, other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
      agents (e.g., ibuprofen) and local anesthetic agents containing vasoconstrictor
      and preservative (antioxidants, i.e., sulfite) agents should be avoided in
      children with concurrent asthma because of their propensity to trigger an
      asthmatic attack. Children with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism should receive only 
      emergency care and this care should be provided in a hospital. Children with
      hypothyroidism are hyperresponsive to even small dosages of analgesics and
      anesthetic agents; proper dosing and venue of dental procedures should be a joint
      decision between the child's dentist and pediatrician. Children with dyslexia and
      concurrent inflammatory bowel disease may require shorter appointments and
      nitrous oxide sedation to reduce stress. Those receiving corticosteroids or with 
      a history of steroid therapy within the past year may need supplementation to
      avoid an adrenal crisis brought about by the stress of dental care.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Auditory brainstem responses of children with developmental language disorders.
PG  - 26-33
AB  - Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were recorded from 48 children with 
      language disorders (aged four to nine years old, IQs normal to borderline, normal
      audiometric thresholds and attending special school) and 20 healthy children
      (four to eight years old, with normal IQs, audiometry and school-level). The
      language-disabled group showed significantly lower absolute latency values of the
      BAEPs than controls. There were no significant differences in the central
      conduction time of the auditory pathway (I-V interval). Therefore, the only
      significant difference corresponded to a minor value for the first wave (auditory
      nerve discharge) of the BAEP. A reduction in the control mechanisms of the
      sensory inputs at the peripheral level, or a disturbance in the inhibitory
      mechanisms of cortico-subcortical modulation, might explain these findings.

AB  - Developmental aphasia is the most severe form of speech retardation and needs
      therapeutic intervention. The young age of these children (< 3 years) makes
      therapy difficult. A specified speech therapy is not possible at this age.
      Intensive stimulation of verbal communication by the parents is necessary.
      Therefore we developed a specialized training program for parents. This
      preparation is very useful for later therapy and should prevent disturbance of
      interaction between parents and child. We will present our concept.

AB  - The genetic basis of Developmental Dysphasia is discussed with precise
      neuropsychological descriptions of 11 cases in six families. In these cases the
      coexistence in the same family of completely normal and severely impaired
      siblings suggests a genetic rather than a familial socio-linguistic cause. The
      possibility of father-son transmission eliminates X-linked inheritance. The
      results are discussed with a reappraisal of the literature and seem to emphasize 
      the genetic basis, possibly, with autosomal dominant transmission in some cases
      of Developmental Dysphasia.

AB  - The complex relationship between epilepsy, language, and behavior is not well
      understood. Neurologic disorders such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome, electrical
      status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut
      syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, autism, and developmental language disorders are
      useful clinical models in the investigation of this complex relationship. These
      disorders are reviewed in terms of their contribution to our present knowledge of
      the relationship between epilepsy, language, and behavior. Present management
      issues and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This survey deals with the underlying biological causes and pathogenetic
      mechanisms of developmental dysphasia. There can be a basic syndrome of "pure
      dysphasia"; these children are very likely to have a genetically determined
      developmental disorder on a limited neuronal level (no cerebral damage of any
      kind) on a developmental disorder by other factors such as an abnormal cortical
      architecture and abnormal symmetry of the hemispheres. In somewhat more than half
      the patients, the basic syndrome of pure dysphasia is accompanied by other
      neurological signs, most of which are indicative of functional disorders of the
      left hemisphere. There can also be symptoms of the right hemisphere, of the
      corpus callosum and of the afferent pathway systems for auditory perception. The 
      nature and causes of these anomalies can be multifarious, so that it is
      unfeasible to speak of the substrate or the pathogenesis.

PG  - 3743-7
AB  - Music lacks the specific sound-concept association that is characteristic of
      speech, making exchange of information less precise. Nevertheless, verbal
      language has not replaced musical communication. Music is common to all peoples
      and cultures, probably because certain impressions and emotions are communicated 
      more successfully by direct musical intuition. Different musical traditions have 
      common features which can be explained by acoustic, auditory and neurobiological 
      mechanisms. Harmonic (consonant) intervals--octave, fifth, fourth, third--play an
      important role, and are also spontaneously preferred by animals (rats). Pitch and
      chords are simultaneous patterns that are normally controlled by the right
      (non-speech) hemisphere of the brain. Rhythm, speech and language, and prosody
      are sequential patterns that are controlled by the left hemisphere. Musical
      sounds are stored as structural memory patterns, analogous to poetry or rhyme,
      independent of comprehension. Simultaneous singing and rhythmic movement
      facilitate initiation and fluency of speech. Musical functions are included in
      neuropsychological test batteries. In medicine, music is used as an alternative
      channel of communication in aphasia and developmental disorders, and in
      psychotherapy.

TI  - Cognitive disorders in children.
PG  - 675-9
AB  - Cognitive disorders affect thinking and perceptual processes and the acquisition 
      of knowledge and new information. They have an enormous societal impact because
      special educational resources are required, and independent living often cannot
      be achieved. Learning problems may lead to behavioral disorders in the home and
      community. The pathogenesis of most mild and moderate cognitive disorders is
      poorly understood. Severe cognitive impairment is usually accompanied by somatic 
      abnormalities, and an etiology can be identified in many cases. Specific
      treatments are available for disorders such as cogenital hypothyroidism, some
      metabolic acidurias, and congenital toxoplasmosis. Other disorders affecting
      cognition such as fetal alcohol syndrome, maternal cocaine and heroin exposure,
      HIV encephalopathy, and prematurity require aggressive prevention and education
      to reduce their occurrence. The recent advances in molecular genetics offer a
      faster and better method of diagnosing fragile X syndrome, now recognized as the 
      most common inheritable cause of mental retardation. In the future, DNA analysis 
      may elucidate the basis of many other cognitive disorders.

TI  - A reaction time study of grammaticality judgments in children.
PG  - 1208-15
AB  - Grammaticality judgments and decision times for two age groups of normally
      developing children were studied to determine when parsing decisions are made and
      how linguistic knowledge affects parsing. Children showed very good sensitivity
      to grammatical violations, although at somewhat lower levels than those reported 
      for college-age students (Wulfeck, Bates, & Capasso, 1991). Sensitivity results
      also revealed that both groups of children were better at detecting violations
      created by permuting words in a sentence than at recognizing errors of
      morphological selection--a finding that has been observed in adults with Broca's 
      aphasia (Wulfeck & Bates, 1991). Since college students show ceiling performance 
      in their sensitivity to both types of violations, the present study reveals
      developmental changes in sensitivity to different aspects of morphology during
      the elementary school years. Although older children processed violations more
      quickly overall, both groups of children demonstrated very rapid integration of
      information during sentence processing. Decision time results also indicated that
      greater sensitivity to word order violations seemed to enhance childrens' ability
      to take advantage of context across a sentence, resulting in faster decision
      times.

AB  - Three children with pronounced livedo reticularis present since birth (cutis
      marmorata-telangiectasia congenita) have been followed to the ages of eight, 17
      and 21 years. During childhood they developed frequent recurrent transient
      stroke-like hemipareses, affecting either side of the body, associated with
      ipsilateral pain, headache, visual symptoms, dysphasia, fits and confusion.
      Intellectual failure and, in one, progressive spasticity have followed. Attacks
      were more frequent in winter. Other problems have included abnormal peripheral
      vascular responses to temperature change, gastro-intestinal bleeding, glaucoma,
      local tissue hypertrophy and, in the two older patients, renal involvement with
      hypertension. Their condition represents a form of congenital vasculopathy.
      Anticonvulsants, anti-migraine agents, anti-platelet drugs and flunarizine have
      been ineffective. Nifedipine prevented further attacks in one patient and reduced
      attacks in another, but has not helped the third child. Adequate clothing and
      warmth may also be important.

TI  - Epilepsy in children with autistic spectrum disorder.
PG  - 316-22
AB  - A prospective study looking at the prevalence of epilepsy in 246 children with
      autistic spectrum disorder revealed that 7.6% of children satisfying the criteria
      of infantile autism and 5% of those with an autistic condition had epilepsy. The 
      majority had onset of seizures before the age of 1 year. Boys predominated in
      both groups. There was no correlation between the age of onset of seizures, type 
      of seizure, sex, mentality, and the outcome of epilepsy. There is an increased
      risk of epilepsy in autistic children compared to those with developmental
      dysphasia or Down syndrome. There might be some underlying defect of the brain in
      autistic children that causes different degrees of autistic manifestation with
      which epilepsy is associated, as part of the spectrum complex.

      follow-up.
PG  - 777-82
AB  - Schoolchildren aged seven years underwent a complex reaction time (CRT)
      measurement and were followed up regarding language achievements and performance 
      in gymnastics during the nine years of compulsory school. An analysis was made of
      the correlation between school results and CRT findings. In grade 3, there were
      large differences in psychomotor development between children with fast and slow 
      CRT in both sexes. Only minor differences in school achievement were seen between
      girls in different CRT groups. Among the boys, however, many with a slow CRT were
      considered handicapped in language development, with dyslexia as the most
      important problem in addition to poor motoricity. They left compulsory school
      with poor results in Swedish, their native language, and gymnastics, and with a
      certificate that may reduce their changes of future studies and employment. The
      boys in general were inferior to the girls. The slow CRT boys, who were mainly
      considered to be developmentally delayed, also carried a risk of social
      maladjustment. It would appear to be important that psychophysical maturity
      receives attention at school, in addition to emotional and social factors. The
      school health services have an important responsibility in this respect.

TI  - A developmental study of specific spelling disability.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - Previous studies have identified a group of individuals with specific problems in
      spelling, and compared them to a group with problems in reading and spelling.
      Those who are poor at reading and spelling are thought to have more severe
      underlying language problems. This study compared the cognitive abilities of
      three groups of children: one specifically spelling disabled, one spelling and
      reading disabled, and one control group without reading or spelling problems. The
      groups were identified at age 14. A five-year retrospective analysis of their
      performance revealed that both of the disabled groups had been significantly
      poorer than the controls, not only in spelling but also in reading. Both the
      disabled groups showed other signs often associated with dyslexia such as poor
      WISC-R Coding and Digit Span. Analyses of their spelling errors did not reveal
      the superior phonetic abilities which some other studies have found to
      differentiate specifically spelling disabled from reading + spelling disabled
      groups. The specific spelling disabled group did show some evidence of
      superiority in Verbal IQ subtests. These results are consistent with the idea
      that specific spelling disability is a residual problem of individuals who,
      possibly by means of underlying verbal strengths, have managed to compensate for 
      earlier reading difficulties.

      season-of-birth effects for dyslexia, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and
      neurological soft signs in children and adolescents. METHOD: Month of birth and

      population of 585 boys. Odds ratios and etiological fractions were calculated.
      RESULTS: Neurological soft signs showed a sporadic peak for June births and
      schizophrenia spectrum showed a peak for August and November. A smooth curve
      suggesting true seasonality was evident in dyslexia for births in May, June, and 
      July. For different 5-year birth cohorts, early summer birth accounts for 24 to
      71% of cases of dyslexia. CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest that viral infection, 
      especially influenza, during the second trimester of pregnancy is the most
      attractive hypothesis to explain these findings. If this hypothesis is supported,
      immunization in women of child-bearing age could reduce the incidence of
      dyslexia. Secondary prevention could also be enhanced by early identification and
      treatment of children who were exposed in utero.

AB  - Handedness, immunologic disorders, language lateralization, reading fluency, and 
      visual-motor achievements were assessed in 25 patients with congenital adrenal
      hyperplasia and age-matched right- and left-handed normal controls. An increased 
      rate of left-handedness in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia group was evident. 
      The prevalence of immunologic disorders, dichotic listening patterns, and
      visual-motor/reading achievement ratio were more similar to left-handed and
      significantly different from right-handed controls. Females appeared to be more
      affected than males in some of the functions. These results partly support the
      hypothesis of intrauterine androgenic effects on hemispheric function, but not to
      the extent of a complete lateralization shift.

TI  - Neurology of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - Developmental dyslexia was until recently considered to belong solely in the
      domain of educational psychology. With the advent of better theories on language 
      and reading, and better methods for assessing the structure and function of
      living human brains and for determining genetic transmission, dyslexia is now
      poised to become a focal concern of cognitive neuroscience, neurology, and
      genetic research. Still unresolved are questions relating to how much a reading
      disability represents a normal variation or a separate pathological entity, and
      whether the cognitive disorder is primarily cognitive, or secondary to a disorder
      in early perception. Recent findings from neuroanatomy, neurophysiology,
      neuropsychology, and genetics research are reviewed. (This review is an updated
      version of a review first published in Current Opinion In Neurology and
      Neurosurgery 1992, 5:71-76.)

TI  - Arithmetic disabilities, specific and otherwise: a neuropsychological
      perspective.
PG  - 214-26
AB  - From a neuropsychological perspective, this article summarizes research that
      addresses some of the developmental interactions of disabilities in reading,
      spelling, and mechanical arithmetic. The focus is on two subtypes of children
      with learning disabilities who exhibit equally impaired levels of arithmetic
      achievement, but with vastly different patterns of neuropsychological assets and 
      deficits. Qualitative as well as quantitative analyses lead to the conclusion
      that one of these patterns of neuropsychological assets and deficits (i.e., the
      nonverbal learning disabilities syndrome; NLD) leads--at the same time and in
      much the same manner--to specific patterns of impairment in mechanical arithmetic
      and in psychosocial functioning. The other pattern (Group R-S) is found to lead
      to particular patterns of academic deficits (including arithmetic), but not to
      any particular level or type of psychosocial dysfunction. The manifestations of
      the NLD profile in various types of neurological disease, disorder, and
      dysfunction are also explored.

PG  - 195-9
AB  - This study investigated the developmental, demographic, educational, and
      psychosocial outcome of 36 adults with third-generation familial dyslexia.
      Control subjects were 44 unaffected age-matched family members. Compared with
      control subjects, those with familial dyslexia 1) had similar incidences of
      perinatal complications, left-handedness, and right-left confusion but reported
      more early speech/language problems; 2) performed worse in reading and spelling
      but had similar educational achievement; 3) were more likely to report
      depression/anxiety symptoms and to have attention-deficit disorder with
      hyperactivity; and 4) were similar in medical history, marital stability, and
      mean income. Data suggest that, despite continued isolated reading deficits,
      carefully selected subjects with adult familial dyslexia do not show the
      previously described downward course of the learning-disabled population.

TI  - An examination of phonemic processing abilities in children during their
      first-grade year.
PG  - 167-77
AB  - The present study examined the development of reading and phonological processing
      abilities of 209 first graders (118 males, 91 females; mean age = 86.7 months)
      assessed during the first and last quarters of their first-grade year. The
      children were arranged into three different groups based on their Time 2 reading 
      and intelligence data (children with and without reading disabilities, and
      "garden-variety" poor readers). Analyses indicated that the children with reading
      disabilities and the garden-variety poor readers did not differ significantly on 
      many of the tasks, but both performed differently than the children without
      reading disabilities. Developmental analyses indicated that all three groups
      increased their reading and phonological skills; however, the gap between the
      performance of the children without reading disabilities and the other two groups
      widened from Time 1 to Time 2. The most important finding of the present study
      concerned the classification results of the discriminant analysis, which
      correctly identified the group membership of 207 of the 209 children (99.04%
      correct).

TI  - A developmental deficit in short-term phonological memory: implications for
      language and reading.
PG  - 65-78
AB  - QU, an eight-year-old boy, was identified from a large scale normative study on
      the basis of his greatly reduced digit span, combined with normal long-term
      memory and non-verbal intelligence. Further investigation indicated that his
      visual STM was normal, but that he was clearly impaired on two verbal STM tests, 
      nonword repetition, and memory span for words. His span showed clear effects of
      phonological similarity and word-length, suggesting qualitatively normal
      functioning of the phonological loop component of working memory, despite a
      quantitative impairment in level of performance. This pattern resembles that
      found in an earlier study of children with a specific language disorder. We
      tested QU on measures of vocabulary, syntax, and reading, and found him to be
      substantially below the age norms on all three. The implications of these
      findings are discussed for the role of the phonological loop in language
      development.

TI  - Developmental language disorders: evidence for a basic processing deficit.
PG  - 98-106
AB  - Although there is still some disagreement whether developmental reading and
      language disorders are neurologically based, recent research provides increasing 
      evidence that these disorders may be due to both abnormal cerebral lateralization
      patterns and neurological pathology at the cellular level. Technological advances
      in the field of neuroscience have led to increasing knowledge about
      brain-behavior relationships, particularly in the area of higher cognitive
      functions. Hypotheses about the underlying causes of the functional deficits
      characterizing developmental language and reading disorders are now focusing on
      specific neurological processing mechanisms, the disruption of which may be at
      the heart of these disorders.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia and medical assessment.
PG  - 134-7
AB  - Developmental dyscalculia (DC) is a primary cognitive disorder of childhood
      manifested by disturbance of arithmetic ability. As an isolated learning
      disability (LD), it is usually treated by remedial education and not referred for
      further medical evaluation. We examined a group of 7 third-grade children with DC
      attending a mainstream school who had not progressed academically in spite of
      specific special education intervention. We were able to identify in all 7
      children neurological conditions that had direct bearing on the children's
      cognitive disabilities and remedial programs. One child had petit mal seizures,
      another developmental Gerstmann syndrome, a third had dyslexia for numbers, and 4
      children had attention deficit disorders without hyperactivity. Based on this
      experience, we suggest that the indications for medical or neurological
      assessment be broadened to include children who are not improving academically in
      spite of appropriate professional intervention.

TI  - L1 Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews
AB  - The phenotypic spectrum of L1 syndrome includes X-linked hydrocephalus with
      stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius (HSAS), MASA syndrome (Mental retardation,
      Aphasia [delayed speech], Spastic paraplegia [shuffling gait], Adducted thumbs), 
      SPG1 (X-linked complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia type 1), and X-linked
      complicated corpus callosum agenesis. Males with HSAS are born with severe
      hydrocephalus, adducted thumbs, and spasticity; intellectual disability is
      severe. In less severely affected males, hydrocephalus may be subclinically
      present and documented only because of developmental delay; intellectual
      disability ranges from mild (IQ: 50-70) to moderate (IQ: 30-50). The diagnosis of
      L1 syndrome can be established in males with characteristic clinical and
      neuropathologic findings and a family history consistent with X-linked
      inheritance. Of note, bilateral absence of the pyramids detected by MRI or
      autopsy is an almost pathognomonic finding. Molecular genetic testing of L1CAM,
      the only gene associated with L1 syndrome, is available on a clinical basis.
      Treatment of manifestations: It is best to involve a multidisciplinary team with 
      expertise in pediatrics, child neurology, neurosurgery, rehabilitation, and
      medical genetics. Shunting of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be performed
      as needed to reduce intracranial pressure. Surgery for adducted thumbs is not
      indicated; in some milder cases, tendon transfer and/or splint may improve thumb 
      function. Surveillance: Monitoring of developmental progress and neurologic
      findings. L1 syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. Women who are carriers 
      have a 50% chance of transmitting the disease-causing mutation in each pregnancy.
      Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected; daughters who inherit the
      mutation will be carriers. Affected males do not reproduce. Carrier testing of
      at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing are possible if the L1CAM
      disease-causing mutation has been identified in an affected family member.

PG  - 199-208
AB  - Anarthria and bilateral central facio-linguovelo-pharyngeo-masticatory paralysis 
      with "automatic voluntary dissociation" are the clinical hallmarks of
      Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (FCMS), the corticosubcortial type of suprabulbar
      palsy. A literature review of 62 FCMS reports allowed the differentiation of five
      clinical types of FCMS: (a) the classical and most common form associated with
      cerebrovascular disease, (b) a subacute form caused by central nervous system
      infections, (c) a developmental form probably most often related to neuronal
      migration disorders, (d) a reversible form in children with epilepsy, and (e) a
      rare type associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Bilateral opercular
      lesions were confirmed in 31 of 41 patients who had CT or MRI performed, and by
      necropsy in 7 of 10 patients. FCMS could be attributed to unilateral lesions in 2
      patients. The typical presentation and differential diagnosis of FCMS provide
      important clues to lesion localization in clinical neurology. FCMS is a paretic
      and not an apraxic disorder and is not characterized by language disturbances.
      Its clinical features prove divergent corticobulbar pathways for voluntary and
      automatic motor control of craniofacial muscles. Precise
      clinico-neuroradiological correlations should facilitate the identification of
      the structural substrate of "automatic voluntary dissociation" in FCMS.

AB  - This study focuses on the nature and scope of thought disturbances in dysphasic
      children (age 6 to 10). It is a developmental and clinical study. The dysphasic
      child clearly manifests disturbances in language. These can be understood as
      disturbances of the linguistic "containers of thought". What impact do they have 
      on the development of cognitive and affective experiences? A controlled study of 
      logical operations involving reversibility and invariates shows some significant 
      differences between dysphasic children and a matched group of non patient
      children. Findings, both, quantitative and qualitative, point to some specific
      difficulties in the acquisition of operative (in Piaget sense) structures of
      thought. Often regarded as "practical persons" dysphasic children manifest
      peculiar ways of integrating their affective experiences in a factual mode akin
      to alexithymia. Linguistic anomalies seem to be important elements of some
      complex "noeto linguistic" disturbances. Linguistic difficulties have a global
      impact on the quality of life of dysphasic children and need further
      investigation for developing relevant intervention programs.

AB  - This survey deals with the early diagnosis and treatment of children with
      developmental dysphasia, which may prevent the progression of learning and
      behavior disorders. In the pre-verbal and early verbal stage, the severity of the
      clinical picture is primarily determined by concomitant motor pathology (motor
      dysfunction, dysarthria, general and oral dyspraxia) and by receptive pathology
      (hearing and auditory perception). In the verbal period, linguistic problems
      start to play a role, and often combine with oral motor symptoms to present a
      mixed picture. Various language syndromes do not become clear until some time
      later. After the kindergarten period, the oral motor and perceptual problems
      decrease and the language disorders continue to play a role and influence the
      child's conversation, internal speech reading and spelling at school. In a
      relatively small number of children without oral motor, perceptual or memory
      problems, there can be a basic syndrome of "pure dysphasia" without any other
      neurological signs. In somewhat more than half the patients, the basic syndrome
      of pure dysphasia is accompanied by other neurological signs. Treatment should
      not be confined to speech therapy techniques, but can only be optimally given by 
      a highly trained team whose expertise also extends to the schooling aspect.

PG  - 399-404
AB  - In this study of the course of developmental reading disorder, 40 Caucasian
      children, who were diagnosed and began reading therapy at 7-years-old were
      followed-up at 14-years-old. A variety of methodological concerns were addressed 
      by careful screening of the subjects, by attempting to include a representative
      population, by comparing standardized measures statistically at initial and
      follow-up testing, and by using a homogeneously delayed population. It was found 
      that 40% of the subjects were reading appropriately at follow-up. Improvement and
      recovery were significantly related to parents' educational status, especially to
      IQ, and not to gender of subject or to having a speech articulation or
      hyperactivity problem. It was concluded that for those who receive early
      diagnosis and treatment of developmental reading disorder (1) IQ may be a good
      predictor of recovery potential and (2) remedial efforts for the low IQ dyslexic 
      child may be optimal if cognitive therapy is included in addition to reading
      therapy.

PG  - 361-5
AB  - The clinical histories of 27 neonates ventilated with high frequency respirators 
      (Volumetric Diffusive Respirator VDR-2) have been analyzed in order to evaluate
      the efficiency of this type of ventilation in neonatal pathology. The average
      gestational age of these patients was 32 +/- 4 weeks. Most of them (70%)
      presented respiratory distress due to hyaline membrane disease. Of the remaining 
      cases, three (11%) presented with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, two with
      pulmonary hypertension, two with meconium aspiration syndrome, one with Group B
      Streptococal sepsis/shock and one with case diaphragmatic agenesia. Between two
      and six hours after initiation of high frequency ventilation (HFV), pH, paCO2 and
      pO2 improved significantly in relationship to former values (p < 0.05- p <
      0.001), reaching values in the normal range at 6.5 +/- 14 hours regarding pH, 30 
      +/- 50 hours regarding paCO2 and 6.5 +/- 10 hours regarding paO2. No hemodynamic 
      modification could be attributed to this procedure. The principal complications
      were ectopic air (62%) and necrotizing tracheobronchitis (TBN) (25%).
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP) was diagnosed in 20% of the cases, ductus (DAP) 
      in 33% of the cases and intracraneal hemorrhage in 25% of the cases. Mortality
      was 70%. High frequency ventilation is an alternative procedure to conventional
      ventilation in this group of neonates. It produces an important number of
      favorable responses, but has complications that can not be overlooked.

OAB - PIP: Clinical records of 27 newborns treated with high frequency ventilation in a
      hospital neonatal service in Madrid were retrospectively studied. High frequency 
      ventilation is a technique with specific indications that has recently been
      applied in some neonatal pathologies as an alternative to conventional
      ventilation. The respirators, model 2 Volumetric Diffusive Respirators, were used
      in 24 of the 27 cases because of failure of conventional ventilation. The 27
      newborns weighed an average of 1850 +or- 944 g and ranged from 900 to 4000 g.
      Their average gestational age was 32 +or- 4 weeks, and the range was 26-42 weeks.
      19 had respiratory difficulties stemming from hyaline membrane disease, 3 had
      congenital diaphragmatic hernias, 2 had pulmonary hypertension, and one each had 
      meconium aspiration syndrome, septic shock from group B streptococcus, and
      diaphragmatic agenesia. 66% were delivered by cesarean. The pH, paCO2, and paO2
      improved significantly between 2 and 6 hours after initiation of HFV treatment.
      Values in the normal range were reached at 6.5 +or- 14 hours for pH, 30 +or- 50
      hours for paCO2, and 6.5 +or- 10 hours for paO2. No hemodynamic modifications
      were attributed to HFV. The most significant complications were ectopic air (62%)
      and necrotizing tracheobronchitis (25%). Broncopulmonary dysphasia was diagnosed 
      in 20%, ductus in 33%, and intracraneal hemorrhage in 25%. The case fatality rate
      was 70%. Ten newborns improved definitively with HFV and proceeded to
      conventional ventilation. Two later succumbed to other causes. The study showed
      that HFV can lead to serious complications and should be applied with great
      prudence despite it great potential benefit.

TI  - Specific reading impairments--are they to be associated with emotional
      difficulties?
PG  - 605-15
AB  - The assumption that specific learning disabilities are not causally related to
      emotional disturbances is crucial for the cognitive research approaches that
      endeavor to isolate specific malfunctioning cognitive-computational processes.
      Because there are conflicting data regarding the emotional status of subjects
      with learning difficulties, the purpose of this study was the evaluation of the
      emotional status of subjects with specific learning difficulties in comparison
      with that of subjects from several relevant control groups. The HSCL-90 profiles 
      of 38 subjects suffering developmental dyslexia, 28 subjects with subjective
      complaints regarding general concentration and reading comprehension
      difficulties, and 23 psychiatric patients were compared with those of 44 skilled 
      readers without any known emotional difficulties. All subjects were adolescents
      and young adults (age range = 15 to 23). A cluster analysis of subjects' HSCL-90 
      profiles did not reveal any significant differences between subjects with
      dyslexia and control subjects. Both groups, on the other hand, were easily
      differentiated from psychiatric patients. Subjects with severe deficits in their 
      ability to remember details of a text, and with subjective complaints regarding
      concentration difficulties, tended to generate emotional profiles that testify to
      a high level of anxiety. Although these subjects, as well as individuals with
      dyslexia, may be regarded at the functional level as inefficient readers, the two
      groups seem to clearly differ regarding the failure factors that underlie their
      phenotypic difficulties.

TI  - The development of induced cerebrocortical microgyria in the rat.
PG  - 601-11
AB  - Placement of a freezing probe on the skull of neonatal rats produces four-layered
      microgyria, complete with a lamina dissecans and microsulcus. We studied the
      developmental course of this induced microgyria under light microscopy by
      examining changes in neurons, glia, and macrophages following a focal freezing
      insult on the day of birth (postnatal day [P]0). The destruction of neurons and
      glia induced by the freezing probe extends through the cortical plate and
      occasionally through the subplate, but the pial membrane appears undamaged and
      radial glial cells, while damaged, are not eliminated. Reactive astrocytes and
      macrophages arrive in the damaged area within 24 hours of the injury, and repair 
      of the damaged tissue peaks within the first week. Damaged radial glial fibers
      regrow, and supragranular neurons migrate through this damaged area, also within 
      the first week. The newly formed supragranular layer overlies the cell-free area.
      The damaged cortex begins to assume its adult-like microgyric appearance from P5 
      to P10. On P15 and P32, long glial fibers, resembling radial glia, are present
      and are immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and radial glial fiber
      antibodies (vimentin and Rat-401). No such fibers appear at this age in the
      non-microgyric areas or in normal brains. We conclude that microgyria formation
      may be the consequence of brain repair mechanisms occurring during neuronal
      migration to the neocortex, and that it appears to preserve primitive features
      characteristic of the developing cortex.

TI  - The biology of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 912-5
AB  - Dyslexia is a relatively common disorder that, when severe, persists into
      adulthood. New evidence suggests that females are affected nearly as frequently
      as males. Neuropsychological studies characterize dyslexia as a language disorder
      that involves phonological deficits in particular. Educational therapies aimed at
      direct improvement of reading skill constitute the best available treatment.
      Variable genetic transmission leading to a final common pathway appears to
      involve deficits in phonological coding. Postmortem studies and in vivo
      anatomical imaging suggest altered asymmetry of structures in the temporal lobes,
      and neuroimaging with positron emission tomography indicates left temporoparietal
      dysfunction in particular. Neuromaging is providing a window into the brain that 
      promises further insights into the biology of dyslexia.

TI  - Epileptic electroencephalographic abnormalities and developmental dysphasias: a
      study of 32 patients.
PG  - 216-25
AB  - The relationships between severe developmental dysphasias and epilepsy were
      analysed in 32 patients with congenital dysphasias. The mean age was 8 years 2
      months; 19 of 32 had never had seizures; 9 had had occasional seizures; 4 were
      epileptic. Twenty-two of 32 had normal repeated standard EEGs, but 10 (2 of which
      never had seizures) showed epileptic interictal discharges. During prolonged EEG 
      after sleep deprivation, epileptic abnormalities were observed in 13 of the 32
      cases (4 of which never had seizures). The overall night sleep recordings showed 
      epileptic abnormalities in 30 of the 32 cases (17 of which had never had
      seizures). The epileptic interictal abnormalities varied considerably in
      intensity and aspect in the same patient from one examination to another.
      Developmentally aphasic children show a higher incidence of abnormal EEG than
      expected, particularly during overall night recordings. In most cases, the
      physiopathology of the language disturbance might be identical to that in
      Landau-Kleffner syndrome.

TI  - The processing of negative sentences in fluent aphasics: semantic and pragmatic
      aspects.
PG  - 96-106
AB  - This paper examines the processing of negative sentences with respect to their
      truth value in fluent aphasic subjects. Three groups of 25 subjects each (men and
      women) were studied: the first group consisted of fluent aphasics, the second
      consisted of right temporal lobe-damaged subjects, and the third of normal
      subjects. An experiment of sentence verification was carried out. A quantitative 
      study of reaction time (RT) and a qualitative study of the types of answers were 
      carried out. The results show that the fluent aphasics were impaired in their
      logical-semantic processing of negative sentences and showed a predilection for
      the affirmative in answering strategies. The right temporal lobe-damaged subjects
      showed differences only in respect to the normal subjects in the RT, but not in
      answering strategies. The results suggest that in Wernicke's Aphasics there is a 
      tendency to substitute a type of contextual-pragmatic processing for the
      logical-semantic processing.

TI  - Thirty years of research on developmental neurolinguistics.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - A body of medically important work has accumulated in the field of developmental 
      neurolinguistics in the 30 years since Lenneberg set forth a research agenda for 
      that field, consisting of the following: (1) the physiologic specialization or
      endowment for speech; (2) the genetic origin or natural history of vocalization
      and speech; (3) the nature of prelinguistic behavior, making possible the
      detection of any environmental (social) influences; (4) the development of
      motor-speech organization from birth; and (5) the limiting effects of deficient
      intelligence, hearing, and environmental stimulation. Subsequent study of these
      questions has established a genetic, neuroanatomic, and functional basis for such
      outwardly disparate disorders as dyslexia, stuttering, autism, and delayed
      language. Studies of emergent motor behavior suggest that babbling may index a
      state of neural maturation favoring expression of spoken languages. Based on
      studies of the congenitally deaf, mentally retarded, and other clinical
      populations it is now considered possible to detect early warning signs of
      developmental language disorders during the first year of life based on analyses 
      of vocal turn-taking, gesturing, and utterance complexity.

TI  - Failure to activate the left temporoparietal cortex in dyslexia. An oxygen 15
      positron emission tomographic study.
PG  - 527-34
AB  - To test the hypothesis of left temporoparietal dysfunction in dyslexia, suggested
      by neuropsychological and neuropathologic data, cerebral blood flow was measured 
      with positron emission tomography in 14 right-handed men with severe
      developmental dyslexia (mean [SD] age, 27 [5] years; median reading level, fifth 
      grade) and 14 matched controls at rest and during an auditory phonologic task
      (rhyme detection) and an auditory attention task involving the detection of
      target tones. As expected, normal readers activated left temporoparietal cortex
      during rhyme detection but not during the nonphonologic attentional task.
      Dyslexic men failed to activate those left temporoparietal regions activated in
      controls during rhyme detection but did not differ from controls in these regions
      during rest or attentional testing. Thus, the expected left temporoparietal
      dysfunction was demonstrated only when specific probes for these regions were
      employed.

TI  - A reading level match study of nonword reading skills in poor readers with
      varying IQ.
PG  - 318-26
AB  - This study evaluated the hypothesis that poor readers are characterized by poor
      nonword reading skills, but that a specific deficit, as opposed to a
      developmental lag, in nonword reading will be found only in subjects whose
      reading is discrepant from intellectual ability. To test this hypothesis, we
      measured nonword reading skills in 93 (64 male, 29 female) third-grade poor
      readers and 54 (37 male, 17 female) fifth-grade poor readers (with and without
      reading/IQ discrepancies) who were matched to 147 (81 male, 66 female)
      nondisabled first graders on word identification skills. Results showed third-
      and fifth-grade poor readers to be significantly more impaired than
      word-identification level match first graders on all measures on nonword reading.
      These findings were not related to the verbal IQ level within the poor reader
      groups and, thus, provide strong evidence for a deficit in nonword reading skills
      that is not explained by verbal intelligence.

TI  - Urban multicultural trauma patients.
PG  - 37-40, 42
AB  - The University of Medicine and Dentistry Medical Center in Newark, New Jersey,
      has a caseload of urban multicultural patients. The stage has been set for
      implementing a descriptive research project to study the initial stages of CHI
      and the multicultural trauma patient. A description, characterization, and
      examination of differences between groups of culturally diverse populations have 
      been presented. Perhaps, with continued study, the preliminary observations will 
      eventually yield developmental trends in aphasia and cognitive-communicative
      deficits. The many changes the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association has
      accomplished in the past 5 years in addressing the needs of the multicultural
      population are appreciated. Training programs should emphasize the need for
      cultural sensitivity that affects service provision. We also wish to acknowledge 
      ASHA's efforts in the past in seeking avenues to serve this increasing population
      better. Efforts to recruit individuals who are members of an ethnic minority into
      our profession have improved, but these efforts must be increased to meet the
      challenge of the growing number of multicultural trauma patients. The motto is to
      relentlessly pursue the challenge to serve all populations regardless of culture 
      or language to ensure optimal rehabilitation through speech and language
      treatment.

TI  - Early naming deficits, developmental dyslexia, and a specific deficit hypothesis.
PG  - 219-47
AB  - The present research represents the final 2 years of a 5-year longitudinal
      investigation of (a) confrontation-based, word-retrieval deficits in dyslexic
      children; (b) the role of vocabulary development in these deficits; (c) the
      relationship between confrontation naming performance and three carefully defined
      aspects of reading performance in the general population and in eight dyslexic
      case studies; and (d) the possible specificity of word-retrieval deficits in
      dyslexia. Results indicate enduring problems in word-retrieval processes for
      dyslexic children across the primary grades and into middle childhood. Second,
      these deficits cannot be explained by simple vocabulary deficits. Third, these
      results in conjunction with our earlier data consolidate a pattern of
      differential relationships between specific reading and confrontation naming
      skills that are based on development and on the level of processes involved.
      Trends within case studies suggest the more pronounced the retrieval deficit, the
      more global the reading impairment. And fourth, there appear to be some specific 
      differences in the basis of word-retrieval problems between dyslexic and
      garden-variety or lower achieving readers. Results are discussed within a
      speculative framework that implicates problems in timing as a possible
      predetermining condition in the dyslexias.

PG  - 12-21
AB  - The language comprehension and production abilities of 15 preschool children with
      developmental language disorders (LD) (4;11 yrs.-7;1 yrs.) and 15 control
      children (3;8 yrs.-4;7 yrs.) were investigated. For this purpose a test
      consisting of 135 picture cards was devised. On the production task (plural and
      comparative forms) the majority of the LD children performed significantly poorer
      than the control children. The results of the comprehension tests (plural and
      comparative forms and short sentences) showed marked deficits for the majority of
      the LD children (11 of 15), especially (but not only) in the identification of
      single forms. These combined expressive-receptive deficits should be considered
      in an etiological concept of developmental dysphasia. It is discussed whether
      these deficits are indicative of far-reaching disorders in the processing of
      language.

TI  - Dichotic listening performance in subtypes of developmental dyslexia and a left
      temporal lobe brain tumor contrast group.
PG  - 187-202
AB  - This study examined dichotic listening performance in three subtypes of
      developmental dyslexia and in children with left temporal lobe brain tumors
      (clinical contrast group). Each child was administered a free-recall CV syllable 
      dichotic paradigm (30 pairs). Analysis of variance and Tukey-HSD pairwise
      follow-up comparison indicated that the dichotic listening performance of the
      left temporal lobe brain tumor contrast group (strong LEA/right ear suppression) 
      was significantly different from those of the visual-spatial/dyseidetic (strong
      REA/left ear depression) and mixed (moderate REA/bilateral ear suppression)
      dyslexic subtypes. The language disorder/dysphonetic dyslexic subtype
      demonstrated a REA with right ear depression. Closer inspection of the individual
      performances of the language disorder/dysphonetic dyslexic subtype revealed a
      bimodal distribution with 12 subjects demonstrating a strong LEA/right ear
      suppression and 8 subjects exhibiting a strong REA/left ear depression. These
      results lend support for the contention that the dyslexic population is
      heterogeneous in nature with each subgroup exhibiting (1) a distinct
      neuropsychological test profile and reading pattern and (2) a pattern of
      performance on the dichotic listening task which is consistent with what would be
      expected based upon the pattern of dysfunction exhibited on neuropsychological
      evaluation.

TI  - Language abilities, reading acquisition, and developmental dyslexia: a discussion
      of hypothetical and observed relationships.
PG  - 82-95
AB  - Tests of a model of the expected relationships between language abilities and
      reading achievement measures from the beginning of kindergarten through third
      grade are discussed. At kindergarten, more global language abilities influenced
      early, wholistic measures of reading achievement, including letter and number
      naming. At Grade 1, these earlier accomplishments had a direct effect on word
      recognition, but a second direct effect was also apparent for word and pheneme
      segmentation measured in kindergarten. Comprehension at Grade 1 was influenced
      primarily by word recognition abilities at the same time. At Grade 2,
      comprehension influenced word recognition; at Grade 3, word recognition and
      comprehension were essentially independent. These findings are considered in the 
      context of Frith's three-phase hypothesis of reading acquisition. A rationale for
      testing the potential of training in auditory segmentation to modulate the
      effects of developmental dyslexia is presented.

TI  - Neurological aspects of dyslexia: comment on the balance model.
PG  - 110-2, 123
AB  - The Balance Model rests on a long history of research that suggests that
      different subtypes of dyslexia exist. Based on the notion that there are two
      subtypes of dyslexia, Bakker has articulated a developmental neuropsychological
      model whereby a procedure known as hemisphere-specific stimulation may be
      beneficial in treatment. This article reviews Bakker's model and provides a
      critical examination as to why validating research has not been conducted. While 
      Bakker's Balance Model may hold promise for scientific inquiry, validation of
      treatment effects are needed prior to employing these procedures in clinical
      practice. Further, important conceptual issues remain to be addressed.

TI  - Developmental surface dyslexia and dysgraphia: an orthographic processing
      impairment.
PG  - 285-319
AB  - This study presents a detailed investigation of a young man in his early twenties
      who has suffered from a severe spelling impairment since childhood, and currently
      has a spelling age of only 9 years and 2 months. In contrast with the
      developmental phonological dyslexics reported by Campbell and Butterworth (1985) 
      and Funnell and Davison (1989), his performance on tests of phonological
      awareness is good. In addition, he can read and spell non-words competently and, 
      unlike normal 9-year-old children, virtually all of his spelling errors are
      phonologically appropriate. Further analysis of these errors reveals that he has 
      knowledge of many of the different ways in which a given phoneme can be written, 
      and that he uses phoneme-to-grapheme correspondences at the end of a word that
      are different from those he uses earlier in a word. However, he finds it
      difficult to spell words that contain uncommon phoneme-to-grapheme
      correspondences, which is compatible with the view that he has not developed an
      orthographic spelling lexicon. Although his oral reading of words is prompt and
      generally accurate, analysis of his lexical decision performance and the way that
      he defines homophones indicate that he does not have fully specified lexical
      entries available for reading either. We suggest that he suffers from a general
      orthographic processing deficit, and relies instead upon the combination of
      sub-lexical phonology and a lexicon that contains only partial information about 
      the way in which words are spelt. This leads to reasonably competent reading,
      even of many irregular words, but produces very poor spelling. It is argued that 
      qualitatively different types of developmental dyslexia do genuinely exist, but
      that reading impairments are likely to be much more pronounced in children who
      have a phonological rather than an orthographic processing deficit.

TI  - Nonlissencephalic cortical dysplasias: correlation of imaging findings with
      clinical deficits.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish correlations between MR patterns and clinical outcome in
      patients with nonlissencephalic cortical dysplasias. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MR and
      clinical data from 36 patients with cerebral cortical gyral anomalies (other than
      classical type I or type II lissencephaly) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULT:
      The five patients with diffuse cortical dysplasia, including two with congenital 
      infections, had microcephaly and severe development delay from a very early age. 
      Infantile spasms occurred in three of the five. Focal areas of cortical dysplasia
      were most common in the frontal lobes, but were seen in all areas of the brain.
      The most common MR appearances were 1) a thickened, irregularly bumpy cortex with
      shallow, wide sulci, and 2) a deep infolding of thickened cortex. The twelve
      patients with bilateral focal dysplasia had a high incidence of bilateral motor
      dysfunction (67%), delayed speech (67%), and generalized developmental delay
      (92%). When the dysplasia was unilateral, contralateral spastic hemiplegia or
      monoplegia was present in 14 of 19 patients (74%), but dysphasia was uncommon,
      even in patients with dysplasia in the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere.
      CONCLUSION: Surgical resection of focal areas of cortical dysplasia in patients
      with medically refractory seizures is becoming more common, and the
      neuroradiologist will play an increasingly important role in the initial
      diagnosis and delineation of these anomalies.

      for educators. This article addresses the continuing academic vulnerability of
      these children during the school years. We advance the position that their
      academic vulnerability results from the lifelong need to acquire language, to
      learn with language, and to apply language knowledge for academic learning and
      social development. Issues are addressed that relate to persistence of language
      deficits and learning in school.

AB  - This article begins with an historical overview of the neurological aspects of
      dyslexia, which was originally seen as a member of the family of aphasias. That
      overview is followed by a brief review of familial and genetic factors in
      developmental dyslexia. The article then presents psycholinguistic models of
      dyslexia as they relate to the neurological concepts. Finally, the author reviews
      briefly the evolution of methods that have been successful in the remediation of 
      dyslexia.

TI  - Diagnostic possibilities of ERA in developmental speech disorders.
PG  - 406-8
AB  - The differential diagnosis of developmental speech disorders may be very
      difficult. We tried to differentiate between the developmental dysphasia and
      dysarthria by means of CERA, using the different kinds of stimuli--tone bursts,
      words and white noise. The BERA was performed using the filtered clicks as
      stimuli. We have found the responses to tone, verbal and noise stimuli in
      children with developmental dysarthria. The latency times were prolonged to
      verbal and noise stimuli. We did not find any responses to verbal and noise
      stimuli in children with developmental dysphasia. At the BERA investigation we
      did not find the auditory evoked brainstem responses in children with
      developmental dysarthria on the side of motoric innervation lesion. The latency
      times of waves N3 and N5 were prolonged in children with developmental dysphasia.
      The CERA and BERA seems to be a good differential diagnostic tool for
      differentiation between these two kinds of developmental speech disorders. The
      results confirmed also that there are the mixed forms of those developmental
      speech disorders.

TI  - The Neuropathology of Developmental Dysphasia: Behavioral, Morphological, and
      Physiological Evidence for a Pervasive Temporal Processing Disorder.
PG  - 363-377
AB  - Over the past twenty years, Tallal and colleagues have directed their research
      toward defining the neuropathological mechanisms responsible for developmental
      dysphasia. We have hypothesized that higher level auditory processing
      dysfunction, which has previously been associated with developmental dysphasia,
      may result from more basic temporal processing deficits which interfere with the 
      resolution of rapidly presented, brief duration stimuli. This temporal processing
      deficit interferes with adequate perception of specific verbal stimuli which
      require resolution of brief duration formant transitions, resulting in disordered
      language development. The temporal processing deficit occurs across multiple
      sensory modalities, and also affects rapid and sequential motor production
      skills. Despite relatively normal clinical neuroradiological examinations, in
      vivo morphological analysis, utilizing magnetic resonance imaging techniques for 
      quantitative volumetric measurements of specific brain structures, has identified
      abnormalities in superior parietal, prefrontal, and temporal cortices, as well as
      diencephalic and caudate nuclei. Abnormalities in structures which are involved
      in multimodal processing and sensory motor integration is consistent with the
      behavioral profile of developmental dysphasia. Two alternative hypotheses
      regarding the neurophysiological basis of the multimodal temporal processing
      disorder include: dysfunction in specifc cellular systems which subserve rapid,
      transient processing; and abnormal gating of sensory relay by intralaminar and
      reticular thalamic nuclei.

TI  - Evidence for major gene transmission of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1527-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: --There is strong evidence that developmental dyslexia is both
      familial and heritable, but the mode of genetic transmission has remained
      unclear. In this article, we examine specific genetic hypotheses about the mode
      of transmission of developmental dyslexia by performing complex segregation
      analyses. DESIGN: --A family study method was applied, whereby the relatives of
      dyslexic probands were examined for dyslexia. The families studied represent four
      independently ascertained samples. SETTING: --The four samples of families were
      primarily from rural and suburban communities of Colorado, Washington State, and 
      Iowa. PARTICIPANTS: --A total of 204 families and 1698 individuals in the four
      samples combined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: --The complex segregation program,
      POINTER, was used to test competing genetic hypotheses of how a categorical trait
      (dyslexia) is transmitted in families. RESULTS: --The results were consistent
      with major locus transmission in three of four samples and with polygenic
      transmission in the fourth. In these three samples, the estimates of penetrance
      for the AA, Aa, and aa genotypes (where A is the abnormal allele) were,
      respectively, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.001 to 0.039 in males, and 0.560 to 1.000,
      0.550 to 0.897, and 0.000 in females. The estimated gene frequency of the major
      locus was between 3% and 5%. CONCLUSIONS: --Sex-influenced, additive, or dominant
      transmission occurs in a significant proportion of dyslexic families. Other
      evidence indicates, however, that dyslexia is etiologically heterogeneous and
      that there is genetic heterogeneity even among families selected for apparent
      dominant transmission. Thus, while no single major locus may account for all of
      dyslexia, it is important to pursue potential major loci for dyslexia using
      linkage techniques.

TI  - Physiological and anatomical evidence for a magnocellular defect in developmental
      dyslexia.
PG  - 7943-7
AB  - Several behavioral studies have shown that developmental dyslexics do poorly in
      tests requiring rapid visual processing. In primates fast, low-contrast visual
      information is carried by the magnocellular subdivision of the visual pathway,
      and slow, high-contrast information is carried by the parvocellular division. In 
      this study, we found that dyslexic subjects showed diminished visually evoked
      potentials to rapid, low-contrast stimuli but normal responses to slow or
      high-contrast stimuli. The abnormalities in the dyslexic subjects' evoked
      potentials were consistent with a defect in the magnocellular pathway at the
      level of visual area 1 or earlier. We then compared the lateral geniculate nuclei
      from five dyslexic brains to five control brains and found abnormalities in the
      magnocellular, but not the parvocellular, layers. Studies using auditory and
      somatosensory tests have shown that dyslexics do poorly in these modalities only 
      when the tests require rapid discriminations. We therefore hypothesize that many 
      cortical systems are similarly divided into a fast and a slow subdivision and
      that dyslexia specifically affects the fast subdivisions.

AB  - Dyslexic persons have developmental abnormalities in reading, writing, speech, or
      more than one area. To study differences in personality characteristics 25 each
      dyslexic and nondyslexic men and women, ranging in age from 21 to 73 years,
      completed the 300-word Adjective Check List. Analysis indicated significant
      differences between the two groups on 15 of 37 adjectives. Dyslexic men scored
      significantly lower than nondyslexic men on the Favorable Adjectives checked,
      Achievement, Dominance, Intraception, Heterosexuality, Self-confidence, Personal 
      Adjustment, Ideal Self, and Military Leadership scales, and they scored
      significantly higher than nondyslexic men on the Adapted Child scale. Nondyslexic
      women scored significantly higher than dyslexic women on the Counseling Readiness
      and the High Origence/High Intellectence scales and significantly lower on the
      Nurturance, Nurturing Parent, and Feminine Attributes scales.

TI  - Phenotypic profiles of language-impaired children based on genetic/family
      history.
PG  - 81-95
AB  - Although etiological influences in developmental language impairment (dysphasia) 
      are not well defined, a significant increase of family aggregation for the
      disorder has been reported. We report data from a large cohort of
      language-impaired (LI) children participating in the San Diego longitudinal study
      in which we examined whether children with or without positive family histories
      show different phenotypic profiles. Due to the longitudinal design of the study, 
      questions pertaining to change over time are also addressed. Second, a subgroup
      of the most impaired children were reevaluated to obtain additional information
      pertaining to family history and phenotypic outcome. Approximately 70% of the LI 
      children met criteria for inclusion as family history positive, with fathers
      reporting a history of language or learning problems one and a half to two times 
      as frequently as mothers. LI children with or without a positive family history
      were not significantly different on language skills or IQ. However, subjects
      having a positive family history for developmental language/learning problems
      were significantly lower in socioeconomic status and were rated by parents and
      teachers as having more attention-related behavior problems than their family
      history negative counterparts. Similarly, family history positive LI children
      performed more poorly on standardized academic tests as well as on tests of
      auditory processing and attention.

TI  - Positron emission tomographic studies during serial word-reading by normal and

PG  - 531-44
AB  - Positron-emission tomography (PET) was used to study regional cerebral metabolic 
      activity during oral reading in right-handed adult males with, and without a
      childhood and family history of developmental dyslexia. Significant group
      differences in normalized regional metabolic values were revealed in prefrontal
      cortex and in the lingual (inferior) region of the occipital lobe. Lingual values
      were bilaterally higher for dyslexic than normal readers. In contrast to the
      asymmetry observed in prefrontal and lingual regions in nondyslexic subjects
      during reading, the dyslexic pattern was more symmetric. These results
      demonstrate that individuals who suffered from familial developmental dyslexia as
      children, activate different brain regions during reading as adults, as compared 
      to individuals without such childhood history.

      approaches with standardized testing procedures we used a model that is based on 
      the steps in the development of specific skills. This method can be helpful in
      determining what kinds of intervention would be most appropriate. Both children
      with mixed disorders of scholastic skills also had psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Word identification in isolation and in context by college dyslexic students.
PG  - 471-90
AB  - College dyslexic students (DYS) were compared to chronological age (CA)-matched
      and to reading age (RA)-matched control groups on tasks assessing naming of words
      and nonwords, regular and irregular words, and the use of context in word
      identification. The DYS group had the slowest naming latency for words in all
      tasks. In addition, they had extreme difficulty in naming nonwords, which in
      terms of the dual-route model for word recognition indicates impairment in the
      indirect route to the lexicon. However, they displayed a regularity effect in
      reading regular and irregular words and thus apparently utilized the indirect
      route in reading words. Correlational data supported the conclusion that the data
      are in conflict with the traditional dual-route model, and an alternative
      conceptualization is suggested. The use of context is discussed in terms of the
      interactive-compensatory model (Stanovich, 1980) and findings were generally
      supportive of the model. The DYS subjects of the present study appeared to be
      different from the RA controls and their performance did not support a
      developmental-lag model for explaining their reading problems.

TI  - Understanding of relational time terms before and after in Parkinsonian patients.
PG  - 444-58
AB  - The role of the relational time terms before and after in language comprehension 
      was investigated using patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal controls
      (NC) in Greek. Results lead to the following four conclusions: (a) Comprehension 
      by PD patients of before and after constructions displaying syntactic, semantic, 
      and cognitive constraints equivalent to those of English is significantly
      different from that of NC matched on chronological age, sex, education, and
      socioeconomic status. (b) Before is better understood than after. (c) Syntactic
      variables, when semantic effects are partialed out, do not affect performance.
      The same is true of semantic effects when syntactic variables are partialed out. 
      (d) Order of mention of events is a predominant source of errors when syntax and 
      semantics are controlled. The data are discussed in relation both to findings
      with aphasics and to developmental results on the same time terms.

TI  - Familial aggregation of a developmental language disorder.
PG  - 1-50
AB  - This paper investigates the etiology of developmental dysphasia and its
      linguistic properties. Data are presented that suggest that at least some cases
      of dysphasia are associated with an abnormality in a single dominant gene. The
      results of a series of tests on a large three-generation family, in which half of
      the members have dysphasia, are reported. These results show that abstract
      morphology is impaired in these subjects. It is argued further that the data are 
      consistent with the hypothesis that the dysphasics learn the feature-marked
      lexical items of language as unanalyzed lexical items. They do not have the
      underlying capacity to learn language by constructing paradigms.

      microgyria.
PG  - 145-60
AB  - Cerebrocortical microgyri were induced by placing a freezing probe on the skull
      of P0 and P1 rat pups. Freezing lesions resulted in laminar necrosis of the
      infragranular layers and the subsequent migration of supragranular neurons
      through the region of damage. The result was most often a region of four-layered 
      microgyric cortex consisting of a molecular layer, a thickened layer ii, a lamina
      dissecans (corresponding to the necrotized layers IV, V, and VIa), and a neuronal
      layer iv which corresponded to layer VIb of the intact cortex. Immunocytochemical
      investigation of the microgyric cortex with antibodies to neurofilament, glial
      fibrillary acidic protein and glutamate showed more widespread disruption of
      neocortical architecture than could be seen from Nissl preparations. In contrast,
      vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing neuronal bodies appeared to be
      distributed normally in the microgyric region although their processes were
      sometimes distorted. These results are considered in the light of previous
      research on induced microgyria, and possible implications for the behavioral
      consequences of focal, developmental neuropathologic lesions are discussed.

TI  - The continuum of linguistic dysfunction from pervasive developmental disorders to
      dyslexia.
PG  - 95-111
AB  - This article examines speech and language impairment in relation to several
      common childhood psychiatric disorders. Similarities among disorders can be found
      in the associated language impairments, family histories, and certain language
      outcomes. The article describes prevalence surveys of speech and language
      disorders and the correlates of language impairment, such as IQ, socioeconomic
      status, and birth order. The association between language impairment and
      childhood psychiatric disorders (i.e., hyperactivity, autism) is investigated,
      and the outcomes of language impairment are discussed. Finally, the hypothesis
      that a common underlying neurolinguistic diathesis may be present for certain
      subgroups of psychiatrically disordered children is presented. In some groups,
      psychiatric disorder (i.e., hyperactivity) and linguistic impairment may develop 
      in parallel as a function of an underlying neurodevelopmental immaturity. The
      relation between the linguistic impairment and neurodevelopmental immaturity
      requires clarification so as to disentangle their specific associations with the 
      various disorders discussed.

TI  - Word-finding ability and design fluency in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 47-60
AB  - Certain oral as well as visual language disorders now appear characteristic of
      the developmental dyslexia syndrome. Recent research has revealed word-finding
      difficulties in dyslexic children but has left unanswered questions about
      specificity and causality. Verbal and non-verbal fluency in dyslexics and
      non-dyslexic CA- and RA-matched controls were measured by means of cued lexical
      retrieval and stick design tasks. Evidence for dyslexia-related difficulties was 
      found only at the word form level of access. At the semantic level, dyslexics'
      word finding was superior. Non-verbal (design) fluency was normal. Such findings 
      implicate long-term linguistic memory processes in dyslexia and are consistent
      with neurocognitive models that emphasize diffuse left hemisphere dysfunction.

TI  - The sex ratios of probands and of secondary cases in conditions of multifactorial
      inheritance where liability varies with sex.
PG  - 41-3
AB  - Some pathological conditions affect one sex more often than the other. A curious 
      feature of some of these conditions (dyslexia, congenital dislocation of the hip,
      pyloric stenosis, otosclerosis, lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis) is
      that the sex ratio (proportion of males) of randomly ascertained probands is more
      extreme than that of their affected relatives. In all these conditions,
      multifactorial inheritance has been suspected. A simple model is offered here of 
      multifactorial inheritance with liability varying by sex. Under the model, such a
      disparity between sex ratios would be expected.

AB  - The temporal organization of symmetric and asymmetric bimanual coordination tasks
      was compared between dyslexic adults and normally reading controls by means of a 
      dynamical systems research strategy. Both groups demonstrated the influence of
      the intrinsic dynamics of rhythmic motor behavior on the performance of
      asymmetric bimanual tasks. In normal readers, manual asymmetries of motor control
      had a significant effect on the relative phasing of finger movements; no such
      effects were observed in dyslexic subjects. Group differences are discussed in
      terms of the interaction between neurological constraints and dynamic principles 
      of spontaneous pattern formation.

      retarded children was compared with CA and RA controls on the classification of
      pseudo-words, either by common phoneme or by overall phonetic similarity. The
      retarded readers made fewer classifications based on common phoneme than both
      control groups, while there was no difference between the groups in
      classifications based on overall phonetic similarity. In Experiment 3, adult
      developmental dyslexics were compared with normal adults in the tasks of
      Experiments 1 and 2. The dyslexics made fewer classifications based on a common
      phoneme than the normals, while no difference was found in classifications based 
      on overall phonetic similarity.

TI  - Hormonal influences in developmental learning disabilities.
PG  - 203-11
AB  - Developmental language and learning disabilities in children can take many
      different forms and can result from a variety of causes. Research to date has
      focused primarily on specific disabilities in learning, which are characterized
      by a significant delay or disorder in one aspect of learning against a background
      of otherwise normal development. Learning disabilities affecting language and/or 
      reading acquisition (developmental dysphasia and dyslexia) have been studied most
      thoroughly. Verbal learning disabilities occur more frequently in boys than in
      girls, and there is a higher than expected incidence of left-handedness among
      affected children. Although there are many reasons why a child may have delayed
      or disordered language development, differential diagnosis of specific
      developmental language or reading disorders calls for ruling out mental
      retardation, peripheral auditory or visual dysfunction, autism, frank
      neurological impairments such as hemiplegia or seizure disorder, and severe
      social deprivation or lack of educational opportunity. The typical profile of a
      developmentally dysphasic or dyslexic child is one who shows a marked discrepancy
      between nonverbal (performance) IQ and verbal IQ, with a history of delayed or
      disordered speech, language and/or reading development. Such a child usually
      performs quite normally on visual spatial tasks, while demonstrating severe
      deficits in tasks of auditory temporal processing, motor sequencing, phonological
      processing and memory, language, reading and spelling. This characteristic
      neuropsychological profile may suggest left hemisphere dysfunction or a failure
      to develop normal cerebral lateralization. The etiology of these developmental
      learning disorders is unknown, but there is evidence of familial aggregation,
      indicating a potential genetic basis. Although these children respond to
      remediation, longitudinal studies have shown that the symptoms often persist into
      adulthood (see Tallal, 1988, for a more detailed discussion).

TI  - Developmental dyslexia in women: neuropathological findings in three patients.
PG  - 727-38
AB  - Brains from male cases with dyslexia show symmetry of the planum temporale and
      predominantly left-sided cerebrocortical microdysgenesis. We now report on three 
      women with dyslexia. In all brains, the planum temporale was again symmetrical.
      Also, in two of the brains, multiple foci of cerebrocortical glial scarring were 
      present. In both women, many of the scars were myelinated, suggesting origination
      during late intrauterine or early postnatal life. In one, scars were mainly left 
      perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal
      cortex. In the other, scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of
      the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically. All three
      cases showed to a variable extent brain warts, molecular layer ectopias, and
      focal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases. Two
      women had primary brain neoplasms, an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade
      astrocytoma, respectively, and two women showed small angiomas. Reexamination of 
      previously reported male cases disclosed one with myelinated glial scars. Two
      control brains with asymmetrical plana temporale showed myelinated glial scars as
      well. The significance of the anatomical findings is discussed, and possible
      etiological factors are considered with known effects of autoimmune diseases on
      the nervous system.

PG  - 556-75
AB  - The rate variable in rapid automatized naming (RAN) was investigated in 50
      adolescent and 40 adult students with developmental dyslexia, in matched normal
      controls, and in learning-disabled students without reading difficulties. Visual 
      stimuli depicting familiar colors and common objects were presented in isolation 
      at three film speeds and three exposure times. Film speed and exposure time
      contributed as independent variables to error rate; and dyslexic subjects of both
      age groups made significantly more naming errors than controls. Dyslexic subjects
      also responded with longer naming latencies than controls when the same RAN
      stimuli were presented in a continuous sequential mode as a matrix of rows and
      columns. Naming latencies in the sequential presentation were highly correlated
      with naming errors in the film version. The implications of reduced naming rates 
      for nongraphological stimuli in developmental dyslexia are discussed.

TI  - MASA syndrome: new clinical features and linkage analysis using DNA probes.
PG  - 688-92
AB  - We describe a two generation family in which two males have the X linked
      recessive MASA syndrome (mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, and
      adducted thumbs). A third male in this family died at the age of 15 years from
      congenital hydrocephalus. In the present family cerebral abnormalities are
      reported for the first time. Linkage analysis confirms the chromosome
      localisation at Xq28. A crossover between the coagulation factor VIII locus (F8C)
      and MASA syndrome, but not with DXS52 and DXS305, locates the gene on the same
      side of F8C as DXS52 and DXS305. The possible relationship between MASA syndrome 
      and X linked hydrocephalus is discussed.

AB  - Routine cell stains disclose abnormal, usually single, nests of ectopic neurons
      in neocortical layer I of New Zealand Black (NZB) and BXSB autoimmune mice. We
      have suggested that these anomalies represent only the most visible part of more 
      widespread cortical disorganization. In an attempt to determine the true
      magnitude of cellular and fiber disruption associated with the presence of
      ectopias, we stained cortical sections containing ectopias in layer I from NZB
      and BXSB mice with an antibody directed against the 68 kDa subunit of
      neurofilament protein. The neurofilament-stained sections revealed substantial
      disruption of the cortical layers underlying the ectopic neurons. This resulted
      primarily from the existence of dense, radially oriented fiber bundles spanning
      the thickness of the cortex underlying the ectopias. In some instances these
      fiber bundles could be seen to join the corpus callosum. Even in a small ectopia,
      where standard stains show no associated cortical dysplasia, dense neurofilament 
      staining was present in layers II and III. It was concluded that the brains of
      autoimmune mice have severe developmental cortical disorganization, which could
      account for the behavioral differences displayed by these animals.

PG  - 1337-45
AB  - A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory 
      from an early age. In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in
      learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and
      songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of
      the year. His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times. A battery
      of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, 
      whereas spatial memory was preserved. Other cognitive functions were intact,
      except for a mild reading disability. No evidence of brain pathology was provided
      by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning.

AB  - Handedness inventory data are peculiarly prone to be used to classify subjects in
      a post hoc fashion. Data from a computer simulation are used to show that if this
      procedure is adopted, significance levels can be seriously misleading: under
      certain conditions the odds of obtaining "significant" results by chance are as
      high as 2:3. Specification of cutoffs after inspection of the data is probably
      the most important source of spurious associations between handedness and
      disorder.

AB  - This study examined the specificity of deviations in patterns of normal brain
      asymmetry on the magnetic resonance imaging scans of 10 dyslexic, 10 attention
      deficit disorder/hyperactivity (ADD/H), and 10 normal age- and sex-matched
      control children. Reliabilities of region of interest measurements for left and
      right anterior and posterior width and area, length of the bilateral insular
      region, and length of the bilateral planum temporale were excellent. Both the
      dyslexic and ADD/H children had significantly smaller right anterior-width
      measurements than did normal subjects. The dyslexics also had a bilaterally
      smaller insular region and significantly smaller left planum temporale than did
      the normal subjects. Seventy percent of the normal and ADD/H children had the
      expected left greater than right pattern of plana asymmetry, while only 10% of
      the dyslexic children did. The very significant increase in the incidence of
      plana symmetry or reversed asymmetry seems unique to dyslexia and may be related 
      to deviations in normal patterns of corticogenesis. Although significantly more
      dyslexic children were left-handed than were the normal and ADD/H children, no
      significant relationship emerged between left-handedness, incidence of allergies 
      or familial autoimmune disease, and variability in indexes of brain morphologic
      findings.

AB  - MRI technique was used to examine the size and symmetry of the plana temporale in
      19 dyslexic students in grade 8 and in carefully matched control subjects. The
      results demonstrated a high frequency of planum symmetry among the dyslexics
      (70%) whereas symmetry was observed in only 30% of the control subjects. It was
      not possible to demonstrate any clear association between symmetry/asymmetry of
      planum temporale and handedness. Word-reading strategies among the dyslexics and 
      control subjects were investigated with computerized tasks where accuracy and
      naming latency were recorded. All subjects with pure phonological deficits in
      reading had symmetrical plana temporale indicating a possible neuroanatomical
      basis for a characteristic symptom of linguistic processing deficiency in
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Reading in callosal agenesis.
PG  - 235-53
AB  - It has been suggested that deficits in explicit phonological processing are
      causal in developmental dyslexia. Deficits in such skills have been reported in
      developmental phonological dyslexia, though not in developmental surface
      dyslexia. The reading performance of two children with callosal agenesis, who
      have been previously shown to have impairments on rhyming tasks, are reported.
      Neither child is dyslexic in the traditional sense, since word reading levels are
      appropriate for age. However, both children have impaired development of the
      phonological reading route despite normal lexical skills. The pattern of their
      reading is therefore comparable to developmental phonological dyslexia. Problems 
      in explicit phonological processing may be causal in the failure to establish an 
      efficient phonological reading route but this is insufficient to create
      difficulty with word recognition itself. The corpus callosum may be essential for
      the normal development of a phonological reading route.

TI  - A developmental, interactive activation model of the word superiority effect.
PG  - 448-87
AB  - Parallel distributed processing (PDP) models of reading developed out of an
      appreciation of the role that context plays in letter and word perception. Adult 
      readers can more accurately identify letters in a word than alone or in other
      random display contexts, a phenomenon known as the Word Superiority Effect (WSE).
      We examined the effects of orthographic context on the letter recognition skills 
      of dyslexic children, comparing their performance to adults, and chronological-
      and reading-age matched groups. Consistent with previous studies, results showed 
      adults better able to identify letters in the context of words and pseudowords
      than in random letter strings. Young normal readers demonstrated the WSE, but
      their pseudoword advantage was less than adults. The dyslexic children showed no 
      WSE at all. PDP computer simulations for the experimental data using the
      Interactive Activation model (IA) suggested that the orthographic components of
      the lexical system of normal children are interactive and distributed as they are
      in adults but provide less bottom-up activation. In addition, top-down processing
      increases with age and reading skill, but may be absent for dyslexic readers.

      neuropsychophysiological analysis.
PG  - 375-85
AB  - The aim of this paper is to compare the motor performances and the
      movement-related macropotentials of 8 male children aged 10 years with
      developmental reading disorders with those of 9 nondisabled male children of the 
      same age. The task employed consisted of initiating the sweep of an oscilloscope 
      with a self-paced movement and terminating it within 50 +/- 10 msec. The children
      with reading disorders were slower, less accurate, and achieved a smaller number 
      of target performances. Their brain macropotentials associated with motor
      programming, processing of sensory information, and evaluation of the results
      were altered in amplitude and latency. In the children with reading disorders,
      the systems involved in planning strategies and processing of sensory information
      are inadequate and those involved in the correction of errors are less efficient.
      Therefore, reading disorders could express defective integration and dysfunction 
      of numerous processes occurring at different levels and times.

PG  - 281-9
AB  - The temporal organization of motor speech was examined in dyslexic adolescents
      and adults without overt speech difficulties, matched normal readers, and
      learning disabled adolescents without reading difficulties. Subjects were asked
      to repeat nonsense two- and three-syllable strings in time to each of four
      metronome speeds. Speech samples were analyzed for repetition rates, time
      coherence between prescribed and actual performance, and serial ordering of
      three-syllable strings. Dyslexic subjects deviated more from the prescribed rate,
      repeated syllables too slowly at all metronome speeds, and made more speech
      sequencing errors than normal or learning disabled controls. Repetition rate and 
      syllable sequencing contributed as independent variables to the temporal
      organization of motor speech. The relevance of motor speech deficits for reading 
      impairment in dyslexia is discussed.

TI  - How good is general practice developmental screening?
PG  - 1177-80
AB  - All developmental screening in Somerset is performed by general practitioners and
      health visitors. A retrospective review of a cohort of 1504 7 year old children
      living in semirural Somerset found that the development assessment by a health
      visitor at age 3 1/2 years had a sensitivity of 45% for identifying the 103
      children with special educational needs, whereas the sensitivity of the preschool
      examination by a general practitioner was 56%. There was no relation between
      results of preschool developmental assessment and later reading ability. Of the
      23 children in special schools, 22 had been identified independently of the
      developmental screening programme before starting school. Intervention was
      started at a mean age of 1 year 5 months (range 2 months to 3 years) for children
      with severe learning difficulties, and 3 years 9 months (2 years 3 months to 6
      years 6 months) for children with moderate learning difficulties. The preschool
      medical examination revealed fairly minor medical problems: 29 of 81 children
      referred for specialist opinions were shown to be medically normal, and for only 
      seven of the medically abnormal children was information about their conditions
      given to their teachers. In Somerset screening the development of all children at
      predetermined ages has not been very useful.

TI  - Abstract letter identities and developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 227-63
AB  - Four experiments, first used by Bigsby (1988a), were presented to three groups of
      competent readers of varying reading ages and to nine developmentally dyslexic
      children. As in the initial study, competent reader data were analysed using
      group statistical analysis techniques together with some discussion of individual
      experimental effects and error levels. Competent reader data were also analysed, 
      as were data from the dyslexic subjects, at a cognitive functional level and
      individual processing descriptions were obtained. Results from the group analysis
      confirmed earlier findings that nominal matches engage an abstract letter
      identity (ALI) code which has a similar capacity to the visual code and that,
      when the ALI code of a reversible letter (b, d, p, q) is accessed, an extra
      processing step is probably involved. Individual processing descriptions revealed
      that several of the dyslexic subjects displayed major impairments in ALI coding
      while some of the competent readers showed mild inefficiencies. A developmental
      trend towards greater processing efficiency was noted, using both methods of
      analysis, for the competent reader sample. It is concluded that results are
      consistent with those models of word recognition which depict ALI coding as a
      necessary prerequisite to word recognition.

TI  - The ontogeny of hemispheric specialization: some old hypotheses revisited.
PG  - 596-614
AB  - This paper re-examines two hypotheses on the ontogeny of hemispheric
      specialization that long ago fell into disfavor in neuropsychology. It is argued 
      that these hypotheses, equipotentiality and progressive lateralization, may have 
      suffered from misinterpretation that fostered premature acceptance of the
      developmental invariance view of hemispheric specialization. An alternative view 
      is presented that incorporates both hypotheses within a neurodevelopmental
      context using anatomical (postmortem) and childhood aphasia data.

TI  - Event-related potentials to visual and language stimuli in normal and dyslexic
      children.
PG  - 318-27
AB  - Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 31 normal and 21 dyslexic
      children, the latter with visual processing impairment, in three visual
      reading-related tasks: a nonalphabetic, an alphabetic, and a lexical decision
      task (two levels of difficulty in each). ERPs were recorded from fifteen active
      electrodes for 1.5 s following stimulus presentation; analyses were done on
      difference waves. N2 and P3 components were usually longer in latency and P3 was 
      lower in amplitude in the dyslexic than in the normal children. The P3 had a
      flatter, broader distribution in the dyslexics than in the controls, which was
      very similar to the effect of difficulty in the two easier tasks. The lack of
      Group X Age interactions is inconsistent with either a maturational lag between
      the groups of children, or with the dyslexic children catching up to normals in
      terms of their speed of processing. Thus, the dyslexic children required more
      time to process the visual information across tasks (with only their letter
      classification being equal to that of the normal controls) and approved to have a
      different developmental pattern in their ERPs from that of the normal children.

TI  - The midsagittal area of the corpus callosum and total neocortical volume differ
      in three inbred strains of mice.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - Differences in the midsagittal area of the corpus callosum have been reported
      between human males and females, between handled and nonhandled rats, and both
      within and between various strains of mice. This measure has, in addition, been
      related to handedness in humans and "pawedness" in certain strains of mice. The
      present study investigated the between- and within-strain differences in three
      inbred strains of mice, two with autoimmune disorders and spontaneously occurring
      developmental neuropathology, in the midsagittal area of the corpus callosum, the
      total neocortical volume, and the asymmetry of the neocortex. These morphometric 
      measures were obtained from coronally sectioned celloidin-embedded material from 
      New Zealand Black (NZB/BINJ), BXSB/MpJ, and DBA/2J mouse strains. NZB mice had a 
      total neocortical volume larger than that of either the BXSB or DBA strains,
      whereas the BSXB mice had a midsagittal area of the corpus callosum larger than
      that of either of the other two strains. In addition, there was a positive
      correlation between these two measures. There was no correlation between total
      neocortical asymmetry and midsagittal area of the corpus callosum in any of the
      three strains. Finally, there were no differences in any morphometric measure
      between animals with or without developmental neuropathology in any given strain.

TI  - Precursors of reading delay: neurodevelopmental milestones.
PG  - 416-20
AB  - The relationship between current reading ability and the achievement of early
      language and motor developmental milestones was evaluated in 240 children, aged 7
      1/2 years, whose language and motor achievement had been charted at each well
      baby visit during the first 2 years of life. Those children whose composite
      reading score was 6 months behind their chronologic age on the Woodcock-Johnson
      Psychoeducational Battery were classified as having reading delay. Relationships 
      to reading outcome were assessed for individual infant milestones, for critical
      screening values, and by statistical techniques that characterized the
      developmental process rather than single milestones. Significant differences (P
      less than .05) were noted between children with and without reading delays for
      the following milestones: 4 to 6 words, 7 to 20 words, 50 words, 2-word
      sentences, and 5 and 8 body parts. The positive predictive value of slower
      milestone achievement ranged from 0% to 50%. Techniques that focused on the
      developmental process during the first 2 years (either rate of achievement of
      neurodevelopmental milestones or order of milestone acquisition) were better able
      to classify children with reading delay (sensitivity = .73, specificity = .78).
      Although the language milestone measures did not classify children sufficiently
      well to be diagnostic, the data served to determine whether a child would be at
      high risk based on performance rather than historical factors.

AB  - In the present study children with dycalculia were described and compared with
      children with specific reading and spelling disabilities and children without
      clinical diagnosis. All children were referred to a child psychiatric outpatient 
      and inpatient department. The comparison was carried out over clinical data drawn
      from the general data documentation and from written case reports including
      diagnostical, anamnestical, symptomatological and developmental neurological
      data. More than 50% of the dyscalculic children displayed other child psychiatric
      disorders, especially emotional disorders. It is questioned in the light of
      developmental psychological understanding if the developmental neurological
      deficits of the dyscalculic children can be seen as etiological significant in
      the sense of basical disorders concerning the deficient development of stable
      conceptions of an inner number space.

PG  - 555-71
AB  - Developments in the field of quantified electroencephalography have enhanced
      visualization of brain function in the learning disabilities. Optimal utilization
      of these techniques requires that populations under study be unambiguously
      defined. Evidence from the literature demonstrates that brain electrical activity
      of children with reading disability is more extensive and differs from that seen 
      in children with "dyslexia-pure". Preliminary data are presented demonstrating
      that electrophysiological change seen in children with dyslexia-plus (dyslexia
      and attentional deficit disorder) could not be predicted by knowledge of
      electrophysiologic change in children with dyslexia-pure alone and attentional
      deficit disorder alone. Data from our laboratory are summarized to show that
      within dyslexia-pure the anomic, dysphonemic and global Denckla subtypes differ
      electrophysiologically from one another. Of particular interest is the
      demonstration that regions of electrophysiological difference among these
      subtypes may reflect compensatory mechanisms rather than pathological change.
      Finally, a case study is presented demonstrating advantageous effects of
      remediation upon brain electrical function. As both spontaneous and
      environmentally induced change in brain function can be documented, developmental
      dyslexia in its broadest terms appears to represent a more dynamic or plastic
      process than previously appreciated.

      laterality and implications to function.
PG  - 529-46
AB  - The human brain and the brains of most mammals studied for this purpose
      demonstrate hemispheric asymmetry of gross anatomical landmarks and/or
      architectonic cortical subdivisions. The magnitude as well as the direction of
      these cortical asymmetries vary among individuals, and in some species there
      exist significant population directional biases. The magnitude, if not the
      direction, of cortical asymmetry is found to predict for relative numbers of
      neurons comprising a given pair of hemispheric architectonic homologues such that
      the more asymmetric the region is, the smaller the number of neurons. Similarly, 
      the more asymmetric a region is, the smaller the density of interhemispheric
      connections and (probably) the greater the density of intrahemispheric
      connections. Developmentally, the decrease in the number of neurons
      characterizing the more asymmetrical regions appears to reflect mainly increased 
      unilateral ontogenetic cell loss, and diminished callosal connectivity might
      signify increased developmental axonal pruning. These relationships between cell 
      numbers, callosal connections, and presumed intrahemispheric relationships can be
      entertained to explain variability in anatomo-clinical correlations for language 
      function and aphasia between left- and right-handers and men and women.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging--a method of studying the size and asymmetry of the
      planum temporale.
PG  - 438-43
AB  - The planum temporale is a triangular region on the upper surface of the temporal 
      lobe. This area of the brain is important for language processing and shows a
      left-right asymmetry of size in most brains. Particular interest has been focused
      on the size and asymmetry of the planum temporale in brains of individuals with
      developmental dyslexia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a method that
      produces excellent morphological details of organic structures. We have developed
      an MRI method of studying the size and asymmetry of the planum temporale in human
      brains. Because of considerable variation of anatomical landmarks in this
      cortical region of the brain, an evaluation of asymmetry is not possible in all
      brains. Furthermore, our experience with this method indicates that any indirect 
      imaging technique of studying asymmetry of the planum temporale must be evaluated
      with caution. With this in mind, however, MRI may give valuable anatomical
      information about the planum temporale in individuals with anomalous language
      function.

      twins.
PG  - 643-55
AB  - This report presents findings for a set of dizygotic twins at age 4 years 9
      months. The male was diagnosed as specifically language impaired. For both
      children, the left-right perisylvian configuration was atypical. Only the male's 
      configuration was symmetrical, a finding in line with autopsy data reported for
      subjects with "developmental dyslexia" who also may have had a form of language
      impairment. In addition, the male had an atypical (L greater than R)
      configuration of the cerebral hemispheres, a finding not seen in his twin, or in 
      a series of volunteers without a history of developmental language impairment.
      The in utero effects of gonadal hormones that may account for these findings are 
      discussed.

TI  - Reduced vergence response velocities in dyslexics: a preliminary report.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - Dyslexia is a developmental disorder characterized by a reduced ability to
      recognize or comprehend written or printed words. Two clinically diagnosed
      dyslexics and two normals served as subjects. Both dyslexic subjects showed
      reduced static accommodative and vergence ranges compared with normals and
      numerous regressions and fixation pauses during reading and target tracking
      tasks. The subjects were then presented with convergent and divergent ramp
      disparity stimuli ranging in speed from 1.33 to 32.0 deg/s and steps of either 2 
      or 4 degrees amplitude. The dyslexic subjects showed reduced vergence velocities 
      and fewer step-ramp and multiple step responses than normals. These preliminary
      findings suggest that certain vergence control functions may be diminished or
      absent in dyslexics. However, the vergence deficit may parallel dyslexia and may 
      not be a causative factor. Thus vergence eye movement measurements may be used to
      provide additional insight into the components of the central deficits associated
      with dyslexia.

TI  - A distributed, developmental model of word recognition and naming.
PG  - 523-68
AB  - A parallel distributed processing model of visual word recognition and
      pronunciation is described. The model consists of sets of orthographic and
      phonological units and an interlevel of hidden units. Weights on connections
      between units were modified during a training phase using the back-propagation
      learning algorithm. The model simulates many aspects of human performance,
      including (a) differences between words in terms of processing difficulty, (b)
      pronunciation of novel items, (c) differences between readers in terms of word
      recognition skill, (d) transitions from beginning to skilled reading, and (e)
      differences in performance on lexical decision and naming tasks. The model's
      behavior early in the learning phase corresponds to that of children acquiring
      word recognition skills. Training with a smaller number of hidden units produces 
      output characteristic of many dyslexic readers. Naming is simulated without
      pronunciation rules, and lexical decisions are simulated without accessing
      word-level representations. The performance of the model is largely determined by
      three factors: the nature of the input, a significant fragment of written
      English; the learning rule, which encodes the implicit structure of the
      orthography in the weights on connections; and the architecture of the system,
      which influences the scope of what can be learned.

TI  - Infantile autism: a syndrome of multiple primary deficits?
PG  - 409-24
AB  - Attempts to explain infantile autism in terms of just one underlying neurological
      or psychological deficit may be misguided. As in the case of many neurological
      syndromes, autism may involve multiple functional deficits due to multiple
      coexistent neurological deficits. Comparison with Asperger's syndrome and the
      developmental dysphasias suggests that the autistic syndrome results from the
      coexistence of at least two distinct constellations of functional impairments:
      deficits in mechanical language skills, as in the developmental dysphasias; and
      deficits in social relatedness, play, and nonverbal communication, as in
      Asperger's syndrome. Possible neurological underpinnings are considered,
      including the relative contribution of the two cerebral hemispheres. Implications
      for etiology and research are discussed.

PG  - 871-5
AB  - Steady-state auditory evoked responses to frequency-modulated tones were obtained
      from normal children and two groups of children with developmental language
      disorders (developmental dysphasia). Children with predominantly expressive
      language impairment produced responses not different from normal children, while 
      children with primary receptive language impairment produced responses that were 
      markedly diminished, even absent. This occurred in recordings from either
      cerebral hemisphere and at mean frequency-modulation depths ranging from +/- 20
      to +/- 100 Hz. Pathophysiology of auditory mechanisms concerned with
      frequency-modulation analysis are particularly associated with receptive
      developmental language impairment and may underlie associated difficulties in
      speech perception.

TI  - Autism, Asperger's syndrome and semantic-pragmatic disorder: where are the
      boundaries?
PG  - 107-21
AB  - The diagnostic criteria for autism have been refined and made more objective
      since Kanner first described the syndrome, so there is now reasonable consistency
      in how this diagnosis is applied. However, many children do not meet these
      criteria, yet show some of the features of autism. Where language development is 
      impaired, such children tend to be classed as cases of developmental dysphasia
      (or specific language impairment) whereas those who learn to talk at the normal
      age may be diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome. It is argued that rather than
      thinking in terms of rigid diagnostic categories, we should recognise that the
      core syndrome of autism shades into other milder forms of disorder in which
      language or non-verbal behaviour may be disproportionately impaired.

AB  - We report a case of a 35-year-old teacher, Louise, with a history of learning
      difficulties and current evidence of developmental phonological dyslexia and
      dysgraphia. Her reading, spelling, and remembering of novel stimuli written in
      conventional alphabetic script was poor, but she performed significantly better
      when the same items were written in the International Phonetic Alphabet, a system
      that she learned when studying linguistics. Her impaired performance in tasks of 
      phonemic segmentation and short-term memory, which are generally associated with 
      impaired reading and spelling of unfamiliar material, could not account for her
      specific difficulty with alphabetic stimuli. Instead, her problems appear to
      result from a lexical strategy, which we have called "lexical capture".

      are likely related to midgestation, the period of neuronal migration from the

AB  - Phonological coding, measured by the oral reading of nonwords, and orthographic
      coding, measured by the discrimination of words from homophonic nonwords (e.g.,
      rane, rain), were compared for pairs of older children with reading disabilities 
      (RD) and younger nondisabled readers matched on word recognition. Phonological
      coding was substantially lower for most children with RD, indicating a unique
      developmental deficit in phonological coding rather than an equal developmental
      lag across all component reading skills. Data from identical and fraternal twins 
      indicated that the phonological coding deficit of the children with RD was highly
      heritable and accounted for most of the heritable variance in their word
      recognition deficits. The deficits of the twins with RD in segmental language
      skills (rhyming and phoneme segmentation) were related to the heritable variance 
      in their phonological coding deficits. Orthographic coding was not significantly 
      heritable, and it accounted for much of the environmental variance in word
      recognition deficits. Implications of the results for the remediation of reading 
      disability are discussed.

AB  - An anatomic pattern of (1) temporal lobe symmetry and (2) left more than right
      frontosylvian cortical anomalies has been documented in a small number of
      children with developmental disorders of reading. These alterations occur during 
      embryogenesis and are the direct result of neither genetic factors nor perinatal 
      stress. Underperformance in reading, writing, and other linguistic skills as well
      as visuo-spatial excellence may result from these changes. Related brain
      mechanisms may influence disorders affecting attention, arithmetic, and nonverbal
      learning. The suspected association between depressed mood and certain learning
      disorders raises the possibility of joint cause. Future work in learning
      disorders must define affective state precisely, specifically characterize
      learning disorder, and wisely apply technology to reveal anatomic, physiological,
      and metabolic correlates.

TI  - The effect of developmental neuropathology on neocortical asymmetry in New
      Zealand black mice.
PG  - 247-54
AB  - Cerebral asymmetry can be considered along two continua-one based on direction
      (i.e., left or right) and another based on magnitude (i.e., symmetrical or
      asymmetrical). The possibility exists that these continua operate independently
      (Collins, 1981). To examine this possibility, the brains of 21 New Zealand Black 
      (NZB) mice with molecular layer neuronal ectopias and 19 NZB mice without
      ectopias were studied. In NZB mice without ectopias, the magnitude of cerebral
      cortical asymmetry was negatively correlated to total cerebral cortical volume, a
      finding previously reported in both humans (Galaburda, Corsiglia, Rosen and
      Sherman, 1987) and rats (Galaburda, Aboitiz, Rosen and Sherman, 1986). NZB mice
      with ectopias showed no such relationship. However, both groups of mice had a
      consistent rightward bias in the direction of neocortical asymmetry, replicating 
      previous results in rodents (Diamond, Johnson and Ingham, 1975; Diamond, Dowling 
      and Johnson, 1981; Kolb, Sutherland, Nonneman and Whishaw, 1982; Ward and

      cerebral cortical asymmetry differ from those underlying the direction of this
      asymmetry.

TI  - Dyslexia and neurodevelopmental pathology: relationships to cognition,
      intelligence, and reading skill acquisition.
PG  - 204-16, 220
AB  - This article addresses the neuroimaging (CT/MRI), electrophysiological (ERP/EEG),
      and postmortem evidence as to the neurological basis of dyslexia and discusses
      why these sources of evidence yield what appear to be inconsistent findings. It
      is concluded that what appear to be inconsistencies may relate in part to
      limitations of these investigative technologies. Then, important correlates of
      reading ability and disability are discussed in a
      developmental-neuropsychological context, and recommendations are made for
      research serving to further integrate cognitive and neurological paradigms. Of
      particular importance, inconsistencies between the results revealed through
      neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and postmortem studies, on the one hand, and 
      neurolinguistic theory, on the other, must be addressed. Articulating the
      neurometabolic role-and particularly the nature of the behavioral correlates of
      the thalamus, supplementary motor area, and frontal cortex-in regard to
      bihemispheric mechanisms related to reading in developmental dyslexia should be a
      priority in future research.

TI  - Unfixed reference, monocular occlusion, and developmental dyslexia--a critique.
PG  - 209-15
AB  - Stein and Fowler have proposed that poor binocular control of vergence eye
      movements is responsible for reading problems in a subset of dyslexic children,
      and that this subgroup is characterised by unstable performance on Dunlop's
      reference eye test. Four predictions from this hypothesis are evaluated in the
      light of published evidence. First, it is shown that a substantial minority of
      good readers have unfixed reference. Second, the evidence for a raised prevalence
      of unfixed reference in dyslexics is reviewed and contradictory findings are
      discussed. Third, it is argued that there is little support for the view that
      dyslexics with unfixed reference make different types of reading errors from
      those with fixed reference: indeed many dyslexics with unfixed reference have
      non-visual, phonological difficulties. Finally, it is argued that studies which
      claim that monocular occlusion is a successful treatment for 'visual dyslexia'
      are methodologically flawed and do not provide convincing evidence for this view.

TI  - Infantile autism and developmental receptive dysphasia: a comparative follow-up
      into middle childhood.
PG  - 19-31
AB  - An interim follow-up study of a group of "higher functioning" boys with infantile
      autism and control group of boys with severe (receptive) developmental language
      disorder (or dysphasia) is reported. The boys were compared both initially and at
      follow-up for overall functioning in the areas of language, peer relationships,
      stereotyped behaviors, and disruptive public behaviors, as well as for the
      presence of a number of specific symptoms. In some respects, the behaviors that
      differentiated the groups initially did so also at follow-up, although there were
      important differences. Very few of the autistic boys had good language skills at 
      follow-up, whereas nearly half of the dysphasic group were communicating well, a 
      difference that is striking in view of the initial general similarity between the
      groups in terms of poor language functioning. However, some of the dysphasic
      children had developed greater difficulties in peer relationships. The
      implications for concepts of the nature of the deficit in severe receptive
      developmental language disorders are considered.

TI  - Communication skills in an aphasic deaf adult.
PG  - 159-61
AB  - A case study is presented of a 64-year-old, right-handed, congenitally deaf man
      who suffered a single, unilateral, left CVA resulting in a right hemiplegia and
      moderate aphasia. The relationship between his verbal (reading and writing),
      manual, and pantomimic performances is examined in two ways. First, a comparison 
      of the three modes of communication shows whether or not these systems can be
      dissociated by pathology. Second, the extent to which one mode recovers more
      fully than the others indicates whether the three modes function independently.
      Results of testing conducted at six weeks and at 18 months postonset revealed
      that this individual's manual, verbal, and pantomimic communication skills were
      all similarly impaired as a result of his CVA. Furthermore, at 18 months no
      single mode had recovered more rapidly or to a greater extent than any other.
      These results support the notion that aphasia in the deaf and hearing population 
      is similar, and is consistent with the view that aphasia is the result of a
      central symbolic/cognitive process which manifests itself in parallel
      dysfunctions of verbal, manual, and pantomimic communication.

TI  - Cerebrocortical microdysgenesis in neurologically normal subjects: a
      histopathologic study.
PG  - 238-44
AB  - Previous studies showed that few foci of cerebro-cortical microdysgenesis
      (molecular layer neuronal ectopias and focal laminar dysplasia) are present in up
      to 26% of variably processed normal brains; they are more common in the right
      inferior frontal region. Brains of male developmental dyslexics processed in
      serial histologic sections showed 30 to 140 foci of these types of anomalies,
      predominantly in left perisylvian cortex. Here, we present the results of a
      detailed analysis of ten normal brains also processed in serial sections. The
      ages ranged from 3.5 to 87 years, all male. Three brains showed abnormalities
      similar in type to those of the dyslexic, but in far smaller numbers and in
      different locations: two showed a single cingulate focus--one right, one left;
      the third brain showed two right supratemporal foci. We conclude that the present
      form of developmental anomaly is rare in normal brains, and that the findings in 
      the dyslexic brains may be significant.

TI  - IQ and reading progress: a test of the capacity notion of IQ.
PG  - 97-100
AB  - Concepts such as developmental reading disorder and dyslexia have been used to
      refer to children whose actual reading achievement is substantially below that
      predicted by performance on IQ tests. Such diagnostic concepts assume that IQ
      sets a limit on either the level of achievement or the rate of progress of which 
      a child is capable. This assumption was investigated in a longitudinal study of
      an unselected cohort of 741 children whose reading achievement was assessed at
      ages 7, 9, 11, and 13 years. Findings on rates of progress and levels of
      achievement clearly indicate that IQ does not set a limit on reading progress,
      even in extreme low IQ children. Thus, the use of IQ tests to determine
      achievement potential in reading appears unwarranted.

AB  - This paper presents data from three studies (a cross-sectional study of
      school-referred children, a test-retest study of subtypes of reading
      disabilities, and a study of a large, random sample of first graders) that focus 
      on specifying the cognitive deficits associated with reading difficulties and
      separating them from those associated with attentional deficits. The cognitive
      deficits associated with difficulty in reading were consistent across samples,
      developmental levels, definitions, and subtypes of reading disabilities. With IQ,
      age, and sex controlled for, poor readers were significantly impaired on measures
      of naming and phonological awareness. The effects of attentional deficits were
      more variable and complex but were clearly separate from the reading disability
      effects.

PG  - 617-38
AB  - After reviewing the various theories trying to explain the different forms of
      dyslexia, the author attempts to show how studying the different stages in
      learning to read and the processes brought into play at each stage allow for a
      different approach to the problem. Based on work done by Utha Frith, the author
      sets out three main strategies that go together and follow each other in
      developing reading skills: recognizing sigh-symbols, sound units and spelling
      patterns. He analyzes the implied processes and considers six different kinds of 
      dyslexia based on on-going genetic analysis. He suggests that this new approach
      toward dyslexia favors new tools in research and in creating support programs for
      dyslexic children.

TI  - Developmental dyscalculia.
PG  - 555-61
AB  - We conducted a neurobehavioral evaluation on eleven children with developmental
      dyscalculia in order to determine which aspects of arithmetic processes are
      affected in this disorder. Our results indicate that memorization of numerical
      facts in these children was poor or virtually non-existent and the ability to
      solve simple arithmetic exercises impaired. By contrast, comprehension and
      production of number functions were intact. Although all children had been
      referred for evaluation of selective deficits in arithmetic skills, they also
      displayed a mild degree of dyslexia, dysgraphia, anomia, and grapho-motor
      dysfunction. We conclude that cognitive mechanisms underlying arithmetic ability 
      can be dissociated developmentally and suggest that remediation programs be
      designed only after detailed analyses of arithmetic and associated cognitive
      skills.

PG  - 189-98
AB  - Otolaryngologists are in the front line of physicians asked to evaluate children 
      whose language development is lagging. The 4 most prevalent conditions to
      consider in the differential diagnosis are impaired hearing, mental deficiency,
      developmental language disorder or dysphasia, and one of the disorders on the
      autistic spectrum. Guidelines on when to become concerned and what to do about
      such children are provided. Early diagnosis is essential in order to provide
      remedial education at the language learning age when intervention is likely to be
      most efficacious.

PG  - 359-66
AB  - Although there have been no randomized clinical trials of the efficacy of
      antimotion sickness medication treatment of developmental dyslexia, some children
      are treated in this way. We have performed two evaluations of such treatments. In
      Experiment 1, 12 children participated in a double-blind within-subject crossover
      design to test the acute (2-day) administration of four preparations: 10 mg
      methylphenidate, 12.5 mg meclizine, both methylphenidate and meclizine, or
      placebo. Improvements obtained with each drug were scattered across measures of
      reading fluency, balance and coordination, and eye movements, suggesting that a
      chronic trial would be justified. In Experiment 2, six children from Experiment 1
      received 12.5 mg meclizine b.i.d. for 3 months and placebo for 3 months in a
      double-blind within-subject crossover design. Meclizine had no effect on reading,
      but it significantly improved ocular motor stability during steady fixation. This
      study thus failed to support the hypothesis that meclizine is of benefit in
      developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Disorders of higher cerebral function in preschool children. 1.
PG  - 1119-24
AB  - In preschoolers, disorders of higher cerebral function are most likely to present
      as inadequate development of language, while in school-age children, learning
      disabilities and attention deficit predominate. The main considerations in the
      differential diagnosis in preschoolers with inadequate language are hearing loss,
      mental deficiency, dysphasia, and autistic spectrum disorders. Attention to the
      child's ability to engage in symbolic play and communicate meaningfully is the
      key to this often baffling differential diagnosis. With the exception of
      definitive assessment of hearing, classic medical investigations are seldom
      informative because structural brain lesions and metabolic errors are much rarer 
      etiologies than prenatal and genetic influences on brain development. While many 
      children improve with age, the underlying deficit(s) usually persists. The role
      of the physician is to detect the developmental problem, give the parents a
      correct diagnosis, refer the child for appropriate investigation and
      intervention, and provide follow-up and counseling. Early diagnosis is essential 
      for effective remediation.

TI  - Neurophysiological studies of human cognitive development in premature infants:
      an approach to the study of maturational brain processes.
PG  - 299-316
AB  - In normal cerebral development, language function typically becomes lateralized
      in the left hemisphere in most individuals. It is theorized that disturbances in 
      the development of this cerebral asymmetry may result in language dysfunction
      such as dyslexia and dysphasia. Recently, it has been reported that language
      disturbances occur in many children who were born prematurely and who have
      suffered insults such as asphyxia and hyperbilirubinemia. Premature infants have 
      also been shown to have a high incidence of abnormalities associated with
      auditory reception. Thus, it is possible that perinatal insults could lead to
      disturbances in the development of normal central nervous system (CNS) functional
      organization which result in later learning disabilities. The extent to which
      such learning impairments are related to nervous system development and to the
      subsequent limitations placed by neonatal insults upon cognitive capacities, is
      unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among
      neurophysiological indices of CNS function, language development, and general
      infant competence over the first two years of life in order to provide
      information concerning the ontogenesis of higher cognitive functioning in both
      preterm and full term infants. In this report we will present an overview of the 
      relevant issues in the area and focus on some of the neurophysiological data
      obtained to date. The approach discussed might prove useful in the study of any
      group of infants at risk for cognitive and/or developmental disorders related to 
      a variety of perinatal insults.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia and word retrieval deficits.
PG  - 1-23
AB  - Developmental dyslexics, selected on the basis of very slow naming rates on the
      Rapid Automatic Naming Tasks (RAN), were compared to normal readers on oral
      language, picture categorization, and reading tasks. Findings indicated that the 
      dyslexics' word retrieval deficits were one symptom of a more generalized,
      however subtle, oral language deficit which involved both receptive and
      expressive oral language functioning. The dyslexics' word retrieval problem also 
      seemed chiefly related to language processing and not to deficits in semantic
      memory as there were no significant differences between dyslexics and controls on
      a nonverbal semantic memory task (picture categorization). In naming and
      identifying printed words, the dyslexics appeared to rely considerably upon the
      "indirect" or "assembly-of-phonology" route; they were slower in naming
      irregularly spelled words compared to regularly spelled words and on a lexical
      decision task, the dyslexics were slower in making negative decisions for
      "pseudohomophones" (e.g., "braik") than for other matched nonwords. Results are
      discussed in terms of the logogen model with some consideration of a
      developmental model as well.

PG  - 319-24
AB  - Eighty children (34 males, 46 females) with congenital upper limb reduction
      defects who attended a regional amputee clinic between 1956 and 1986 were
      classified as to whether they exhibited learning difficulties in school, as
      indicated by grade failure or by placement in learning disability classrooms.
      Children with right-sided defects were more likely to encounter learning
      difficulties than were children with left-sided defects (Chi-square = 6.8; df =
      1; p less than 0.01). Children with right-limb defects also were more likely than
      children with left-limb defects to experience reading problems (Chi-square = 5.9;
      df = 1; p less than 0.05). These results suggest the need for neuropsychological 
      and neurophysiological study of children with limb reduction defects.

PG  - 281-96
AB  - Simultaneous sign and spoken language training was conducted with young,
      language-disordered children under standardized training and follow-up conditions
      with a stringent learning criterion to determine if language learned was stable
      over time. Twenty-one children between 36 and 86 months with no or nonfunctional 
      language participated in the study. Diagnoses included autism, mental
      retardation, combined autism and mental retardation, and developmental aphasia.
      Children completed a mean of 74 signed speech training sessions. Sessions were
      twice daily, 5 days a week. Follow-up evaluations were made approximately 6
      months after training. Of the 21 children, 17 learned at least one word and 7
      children learned multiple-word phrases during the training. Most language learned
      in training was found to be retained at follow-up approximately 6 months later.
      Gestural imitation, play style, language age, developmental age, and fine motor
      skills had strong correlations with language learning and retention.

PG  - 189-207
AB  - J.R. is a middle-aged man whose developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia have
      persisted in a problematic fashion for the 30 years since he left school. He is a
      phonological dyslexic. Whereas surface dyslexics operate on reading units that
      are too small, Mr. R operates on units that are too large. Spelling exhibits both
      regularity and lexicality effects. These seemingly contradictory results are
      consistent with a two-route model of spelling in which each route is functioning 
      with approximately 50% efficiency. Performance on paralinguistic rhyming tasks is
      poor and shows no recovery in comparison to younger developmental phonological
      dyslexics. Difficulties with higher-order sound segmentation, analysis, or
      organization may underly the lifelong literacy problems.

      profiles consistent with a diagnosis of specific learning disability, and similar
      to cognitive profiles commonly seen in individuals from the general population

PG  - S57-64
AB  - Autism is a severe form of childhood psychopathology first described by Leo
      Kanner in 1943. While over the years there has been substantial controversy about
      many features of the syndrome, there is today some consensus as to the behavioral
      characteristics associated with the diagnosis. These include onset of the
      disorder in the early preschool years, severe and pervasive deficits in social
      behavior and attachments, deficits in speech and language, insistence for the
      preservation of sameness, unusual responsiveness to the sensory environment,
      self-stimulation, self-injurious behavior, isolated skill areas, and
      inappropriate affect. Another associated feature of many cases of autism is
      mental retardation. The present article describes these behavioral features as
      well as the application of the diagnosis and differentiation of autism from other
      disorders including primary mental retardation, childhood schizophrenia,
      developmental aphasia, and pervasive developmental disorder.

TI  - Metamemorial knowledge of good and poor readers: a developmental perspective.
PG  - 415-26
AB  - Torgesen (1977b) suggested that reading-disabled children exhibit passivity in
      learning situations; they fail to employ strategies that enhance learning. Such
      passivity resembles that of young children who lack awareness of the utility of
      strategies that enhance cognitive efficiency in a variety of situations (e.g.,
      listening, reading, and memory tasks). Such awareness is one aspect of
      metamemory, and children with reading problems may lag behind other children with
      regard to this aspect. Good readers (second-, third-, and fifth-graders) and poor
      readers (third- and fifth-graders) were interviewed to determine their level of
      knowledge about a number of variables that affect memory in real-life situations.
      Each child was asked questions concerning his or her memory ability, and then was
      shown pictures depicting manipulations of the variables number, time, category,
      and strategy, as well as two-way combinations of the four variables. Results
      generally failed to support the developmental lag hypothesis. Poor readers did
      not resemble younger children in their awareness of variables that affect memory 
      but exhibited knowledge commensurate with that of good readers in the same grade.

TI  - Blood serotonin levels in adults, autistic and non-autistic children--with a
      comparison of different methodologies.
PG  - 625-34
AB  - Recent interest in conditions associated with increased blood serotonin level has
      highlighted the need for consistency between assay methods to allow for more
      accurate delineation of serotonin variables. To this end, comparison was made
      between a spectrofluorimetric technique frequently used in the past and two
      potentially more specific high performance liquid chromatographic procedures.
      Normal ranges and diurnal variations for blood serotonin in adults, normal,
      autistic children and children with developmental dysphasia were also determined.
      No significant difference was found between serotonin level in blood drawn by
      simultaneous venepuncture and capillary (fingerprick) collection. Whilst there
      was no evidence of circadian rhythm, seasonal variation with mean blood serotonin
      levels significantly lower in summer than in two successive winters was
      suggested. Blood serotonin values in normal children tended to decline with
      increasing age. No similar maturational effect was apparent in autistic children.
      The mean level for autistic children in winter was significantly higher than that
      for normal children in the same season; despite this there was considerable
      overlap of blood serotonin levels between normal and autistic groups. Serotonin
      levels determined by the three different methodologies showed a high correlation 
      but differed significantly: caution should be exercised when comparing blood
      serotonin results where different methods are employed.

TI  - Regional cerebral blood flow in severe developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 1144-50
AB  - Regional cerebral blood flow was measured under three task conditions in 14 men
      with severe developmental dyslexia and their control subjects using a xenon 133
      inhalation technique. No group differences in overall level or in pattern of gray
      matter flow were seen under relatively undemanding cognitive conditions. Despite 
      minimal group differences in performance, the dyslexic group showed an increased 
      hemispheric asymmetry (left greater than right) on a semantic classification task
      and a reduced anteroposterior difference on a line orientation task relative to
      controls. The exaggerated asymmetry suggests the possibility of less efficient
      information processing or inadequate bihemispheric integration. The reduced
      anteroposterior gradient may reflect a deficit in the ability of frontal systems 
      to respond adequately to cognitive demands.

AB  - Although Munchausen's syndrome is well known, its mode of onset and development
      are poorly understood. The authors describe an individual whose developmental
      history was notable for dyslexia and pathological lying from early childhood, and
      who later developed Munchausen's syndrome following an explosive separation from 
      his terminally ill father. The patient's simulated genitourinary problems related
      directly to his father's renal malignancy. The development of his Munchausen
      syndrome is discussed with reference to his traumatic separation from his father 
      as well and to his preexisting character pathology and probable central nervous
      system dysfunction.

TI  - Evidence for a genetic aetiology in reading disability of twins.
PG  - 537-9
AB  - Reading disability (dyslexia) is a major social, educational, and mental health
      problem. Although estimates of prevalence vary, up to 10-15% of school-age
      children have severe reading deficits in spite of average intelligence and
      adequate educational opportunity. That reading disability may have a
      constitutional basis has long been recognized, and results of twin and family
      studies suggest that one or more of its forms may be heritable; however,
      definitive evidence for a genetic aetiology has not been reported. Establishing a
      heritable basis for reading disability could suggest possible causes, give
      improved risk estimates, facilitate early diagnosis, and provide validity tests
      for ostensible subtypes. In this report, we apply a recently developed multiple
      regression analysis to data collected from a sample of 64 pairs of identical
      twins and 55 pairs of fraternal twins, in which at least one member of the pairs 
      is reading disabled, and present evidence for a significant genetic aetiology.

TI  - Comparing ways of measuring constructional praxis in the well elderly.
PG  - 500-4
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore ways of testing three-dimensional
      constructional praxis in the independently living well elderly. The testing
      instruments used were adaptations of the block construction portion of the Boston
      Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, the block construction portion of the Hemiplegic 
      Evaluation, and the Three-Dimensional Constructional Praxis Test. For each
      instrument, three types of test administration were developed: models,
      photographs, and drawings of block constructions. Twenty-four subjects, all more 
      than 70 years old, were tested individually with the 3 three-dimensional
      constructional praxis tests on the three types of test administration. The effect
      of order was controlled by counterbalancing. For all three tests, administration 
      with models resulted in the highest performance scores. Although no difference in
      scores existed between photographs and drawings on the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia 
      Examination and the Three-Dimensional Constructional Praxis Test, performance
      scores for photographs were significantly greater than scores for drawings on the
      Hemiplegic Evaluation. Since constructional praxis ability is an important
      component of many activities of daily living, the findings have strong
      implications for testing and for teaching new skills to both the well elderly and
      those disabled by neurological disorders.

TI  - The use of primary sentence stress by normal, aphasic, and autistic children.
PG  - 255-71
AB  - Primary sentence stress is an important aspect of the English prosodic system.
      Its adequate use is a prerequisite in the development of normal intonation
      patterns. This study examined the use of primary sentence stress in autistic
      children with mean length of utterance (MLU) scores between 1.9 and 4.1
      morphemes. Normal and aphasic subjects at similar MLU levels served as contrast
      groups. The primary sentence task required that the subjects verbally respond to 
      a request for information and provide a description of a play situation. Toy
      manipulation was used to elicit the desired responses. Listener judgment served
      as the basis for analyzing results. Although all subjects were able to perform
      the task, differences were seen in the number of correct responses and in the
      pattern of stress misassignment. These results are at variance with a prediction 
      of stress placement on grammatical grounds. An explanation is offered, based on
      pragmatic considerations and cognitive developmental trends in young children.

      the nature of the relationship.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - Eight-and 11-year-old poor readers of average and below average intelligence
      carried out a visually presented immediate memory task, recalling strings of
      similar- and dissimilar-sounding letters. Task difficulty was adjusted for each
      child by determining memory span for the dissimilar items prior to the memory
      task. All poor reader groups recalled significantly more dissimilar- than
      similar-sounding items, and the magnitude of these effects was comparable to
      those shown by their chronological and reading age controls. A close association 
      was found between memory span and reading age, such that average intelligence
      poor readers had memory spans indistinguishable from those of their reading age
      controls. Furthermore, a highly significant correlation was found between memory 
      span and reading age. However, it was concluded that this relationship could not 
      be primarily due to a substantial immediate memory component in word recognition 
      as the below average intelligence poor readers had poorer memory spans than the
      brighter poor readers, yet they had very similar reading ages. Additionally, a
      weaker association was found between memory span and non-word reading than
      between memory span and word reading. It was hypothesized that recognition
      difficulties may be the primary problem underlying both poor word recognition and
      immediate memory impairments in children with reading disorders.

      in an 11-year-old boy with a complex cyanotic heart defect].
PG  - 166-9
AB  - A Blalock-Taussig-anastomosis was performed at the age of 2 years in a boy with
      transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary
      atresia. Nine years later he developed a transient aphasia. Cranial computed
      tomography (CT-scan) revealed a structure compatible with brain abscess. The boy 
      was conscious and no neurological deficit was found. Initial therapy consisted of
      Ampicillin, Tobramycin, and Metronidazole, 12 days later an acute hemiplegia
      developed. 30 ml of pus were aspirated from the brain abscess, and the boy's
      condition dramatically improved. Streptococcus milleri was found
      bacteriologically and antibiotic therapy was continued over six weeks. Serial
      CT-scans during and after therapy demonstrated disappearance of the brain
      abscess. The presented case shows that after a shunt procedure in cyanotic heart 
      disease right-to-left-shunting and therefore chronic oxygen desaturation and
      polycythemia are still present as facilitating factors for focal
      encephalomalacia, cerebritis, and brain abscess. In case of short duration of
      neurological symptoms and a size of abscess less than 4 cm in diameter antibiotic
      therapy without total excision may eliminate the infection.

PG  - 234-60
AB  - The constructs of accuracy and speed were adopted as performance criteria against
      which to define 2 clinical samples of disabled readers. Accuracy-disabled
      subjects had failed to achieve reliable age-appropriate word recognition skills. 
      Rate-disabled readers were age-appropriate in word recognition accuracy but
      deficient in reading speed. These disabled readers were compared to fluent normal
      children selected to be reading at the same level of accuracy as the
      rate-disabled subjects but at a significantly faster rate. All aspects of the
      accuracy-disabled subjects' reading systems proved deficient, and these children 
      were less able to learn new sound-symbol associations in a task simulating
      initial reading acquisition. The rate-disabled subjects exhibited a basic deficit
      in word recognition speed, compromised accuracy when reading in context, and
      compromised spelling when competing visual patterns were available. A
      multidimensional oral language impairment was found to accompany the accuracy
      disability, while the rate disability appeared restricted to language in its
      visible form and the naming of visual representations. A visual naming speed
      impairment was associated with both profiles of deficient reading skill.

      (MMS) (score less than 24) is likely to be related to delirium, dementia, or
      affective disorders. The mildly retarded or learning disabled should perform
      satisfactorily (greater than 24) on the MMS but may show impairment with
      delirium, dementia, or affective disorders. In the absence of a psychiatric
      disorder, it takes moderate mental retardation (IQ less than 55) or severe
      reading disability with IQ less than 70 to produce an MMS score of less than 24. 
      The MMS should not be considered a screen for mental retardation, because
      retarded individuals can function adequately (greater than 24) on the MMS.

TI  - Defective lateralized attention for non-verbal sounds in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 259-68
AB  - The performance of dyslexic and control children--matched for age, sex,
      handedness and performance IQ--was compared on a dichotic listening task in which
      the stimuli were environmental sounds. Two findings emerged. First, the dyslexic 
      group showed a normal, left ear perceptual advantage for these non-verbal
      materials. Second, the dyslexics were incapable of occluding dichotically
      presented sounds to the left ear when required to deploy attention only to sounds
      entering the right ear. This failure of unilateral selective attention was not
      found in the controls, nor in either group under a condition of left ear only
      attention. The data were interpreted as undermining the bihemispheric non-verbal 
      processing hypothesis of developmental dyslexia. It was argued that the
      dyslexics' apparent inability to override voluntarily the reflexive lateral
      orienting mechanism was most consistent with explanatory models emphasizing
      defective functioning, or even malformation, of the left cerebral hemisphere
      alone.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to compare the ability of language-impaired
      and reading-impaired children to process (i.e., encode and retrieve) phonological
      information. Four measures of phonological awareness and several measures of word
      and sentence repetition abilities were used to evaluate phonological processing
      skills. Two additional measures assessed children's awareness of lexical and
      morphological information. Subjects were 12 language-impaired (LI), 12
      reading-impaired (RI), and 12 normal children between the ages of 6 and 8 years. 
      The findings supported previous claims that children with reading impairments
      have difficulty processing phonological information. To our surprise, however,
      the LI children performed significantly worse than the RI children on only three 
      measures, all involving word and sentence repetition. These findings raise
      questions about the distinctiveness of school-age children with a history of
      language impairment and poor readers with no history of language impairment.

PG  - 1045-6
AB  - The brain anatomy of ten men (aged 18 to 28 years) with persistent, severe
      developmental dyslexia was examined with magnetic resonance imaging to explore
      the possibility of visualizing pathology not seen in previous computed
      tomographic scan studies. Nine of the ten examinations were clinically normal.
      One showed a focal finding thought to be incidental to dyslexia. The volume of
      the temporal lobes was judged to be symmetrical in nine of ten examinations, a
      finding supportive of previous computed tomographic scan and neuropathologic
      reports of unusual symmetries of posterior brain regions. Thus, despite its
      sensitivity, magnetic resonance imaging failed to identify a common focal
      pathology. The choice of imaging planes (particularly coronal) and lack of bone
      artifact may, however, prove useful for studying macroscopic asymmetries in
      dyslexia.

AB  - Developmental dyslexics (DDs) and good readers (GRs) were tested on measures of
      interhemispheric coordination. All subjects (ages 16 to 47) demonstrated normal
      oculomotor control and visual acuity, prior to testing. Subjects were instructed 
      to track three different point-light source patterns (single stimulus in one
      hemifield, dual stimuli in one hemifield and a pair of simultaneous, symmetric,
      bihemifield stimuli [SSBS]), presented in random sequence and arrayed
      horizontally at +/- 5, +/- 10, and +/- 15 degrees of eccentricity. Tested with
      unihemifield stimuli, all subjects showed normal saccadic latencies and
      trajectories. In response to SSBS, all GRs had pronounced directional preference,
      choosing largely to track one side over the other. In contrast, DDs showed
      reduced laterality bias (p less than .025). DDs exhibited also significantly
      longer response latencies to SSBS than to unihemifield stimulation (p less than
      .01) and differed significantly from GRs (p less than .05).

TI  - An ultimate view of reading ability.
PG  - 227-30
AB  - Research on reading and developmental reading disorders has almost exclusively
      questioned the immediate or proximate basis of these skills and deficits. A
      supplementary view is offered that considers reading ability from an evolutionary
      vantage. It is argued that in contrast to language, which has a long natural
      history in man and which has risen from a widespread biological adaptation in our
      species, reading has not, until very recently, exerted ecological pressure on
      humans and therefore no specific biological adaptations have occurred for these
      skills. It follows that developmental reading disorders may be due to genetically
      based, naturally occurring variants in neurological traits and not the result of 
      pathological processes.

TI  - Developmental classification of reading-disabled children.
PG  - 371-92
AB  - The present study developed and used longitudinal cluster analysis, a
      multivariate classification technique, to classify a sample of 200 nonclinical
      normal and reading-disabled males based on their performances on a
      neuropsychological battery at kindergarten, second, and fifth grades. The
      resulting classification was examined against various internal and external
      validation criteria. Using a validation framework, five developmental subtypes of
      children, two normal and three deficit reader groups, were found. Three of these 
      groups could best be described as partitions of a multivariate normal
      distribution; the other two, both containing deficit readers, showed different
      covariance structures, suggesting differing developmental patterns. These groups 
      were shown to differ with respect to the domains of academic achievement,
      parental achievement, neurological status, birth histories, school behaviors, and
      neuropsychological-cognitive development. The results suggest that developmental 
      classifications can be formed by using multivariate classification methods and
      the subtypes support findings from cross-sectional classification research on
      similar populations.

TI  - Paul Broca's less heralded contributions to aphasia research. Historical
      perspective and contemporary relevance.
PG  - 609-12
AB  - In addition to discovering the dominant role of the left hemisphere for language 
      and describing what is now known as Broca's aphasia, Paul Broca made other
      insightful, but less well-recalled, aphasiologic observations. He distinguished
      symptoms of Wernicke's aphasia five years before Carl Wernicke's famous
      monograph, and he was the first to exploit the surgical relevance of language
      localization. Broca investigated the anatomic substrate of language laterality by
      comparing the relative weights of the two hemispheres and the two frontal lobes. 
      He considered language lateralization from a developmental point of view and in
      relation to handedness. A relatively small portion of Broca's prodigious
      scientific career was devoted to the study of aphasia, but his seminal work
      encompasses a number of issues of contemporary concern.

TI  - Segmentation and speech perception in relation to reading skill: a developmental 
      analysis.
PG  - 489-507
AB  - The present paper examines the processing of speech by dyslexic readers and
      compares their performance with that of age-matched (CA) and
      reading-ability-matched (RA) controls. In Experiment 1, subjects repeated
      single-syllable stimuli (words and nonwords) presented either in a favorable
      signal-to-noise ratio or with noise masking. Noise affected all subjects to the
      same extent. Dyslexic children performed as well as controls when repeating
      high-frequency words, but they had difficulty relative to CA-controls with
      low-frequency words and relative to both CA- and RA-controls when repeating
      nonwords. In Experiments 2 and 3, subjects made auditory lexical decisions about 
      the stimuli presented in Experiment 1. Dyslexics performed less well than
      CA-controls, gaining similar scores to RA-controls. Thus, their difficulty in
      repeating low-frequency words could be reinterpreted as a difficulty with nonword
      repetition. Taken together, these results suggest that dyslexics have difficulty 
      with the nonlexical procedures (including phoneme segmentation) involved in
      verbal repetition. One consequence is that they take longer to consolidate "new" 
      words; verbal memory and reading processes are also compromised.

TI  - Effects of piracetam on developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 29-39
AB  - A new class of drugs (nootropics) are viewed from the perspective of their
      neuropsychological effect upon developmental dyslexia. Evidence from both the
      preclinical and clinical work conducted on Piracetam is briefly reviewed. The
      latest research on the effects of Piracetam in dyslexia shows a convergence of
      results. Attempts to replicate these results with dyslexia have only met with
      success in the areas of reading rate. In an attempt to find an independent
      replication of the Chase et al. (1984) finding, the author provides additional
      evidence on the effects of Piracetam on reading Rate X Accuracy in dyslexics.

TI  - Rapid alternating stimulus naming in the developmental dyslexias.
PG  - 360-79
AB  - A rapid, alternating stimulus (RAS) naming measure was designed to study the
      developing ability in dyslexic readers to direct attention to contextual patterns
      while performing a rapid serial naming task. The results from a 3-year
      longitudinal investigation of 98 children indicate three trends. RAS performances
      differentiate both average from impaired readers and dyslexic subgroups from each
      other. The largest, most impaired subgroup can not complete the RAS tasks in
      kindergarten; the smaller subgroups have little name access speed deficits. Early
      RAS performances are highly predictive of later reading, particularly at the
      single-word reading level. Implications for understanding the development of
      automaticity and the relationship between retrieval speed and reading are
      discussed.

TI  - [Biological foundations of dyslexia. A review].
PG  - 57-65
AB  - This is a review that summarizes the work done in our laboratory during the last 
      three years. We have studied four dyslexic brains. They all bear a symmetric
      anatomical pattern in a structure closely related to the language areas (planum
      temporale), which is more commonly asymmetric in normal brains. In addition,
      their microscopic examination shows numerous ectopias and dysplasias in the
      cerebral cortex. The high incidence of immune disease in dyslexics and their
      families suggests a more general developmental problem in developmental dyslexia.
      The hypothesis is raised that fetal effects of testosterone are involved in
      regulating neurological as well as immunological development, whereby abnormally 
      high testosterone activity would produce a twofold deficit. Finally, strains of
      immune-defective mice have been found that bear the same cortical abnormalities
      as seen in the dyslexic brains previously studied. The immune-defective mouse may
      prove to be an excellent model for the study of the neuropathological basis of
      developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 473-82
AB  - Recent studies have provided evidence that dyslexic children tend to show longer 
      visual persistence than control children when presented with
      low-spatial-frequency grating stimuli. The possibility that this phenomenon might
      reflect an impairment of inhibitory Y-cell activity in the visual system of
      dyslexics has been investigated. A flicker masking technique was used to mask
      Y-cell activity selectively in a group of dyslexic boys and a group of
      age-matched controls. There were no overall differences in reaction times to the 
      offsets of grating patterns of various spatial frequencies between the groups,
      and no differences between subgroups defined by age, degree of reading
      impairment, or any other criterion. The results show no evidence of abnormal
      Y-cell function in developmental dyslexia.

TI  - Cross-national comparisons of developmental dyslexia in Italy and the United
      States.
PG  - 1404-17
AB  - This study was designed to examine whether the phonetic regularity of a language 
      can significantly influence the prevalence and pattern of developmental dyslexia.
      Demographically matched samples of fifth-grade children in Italy (N = 448) and
      the United States (N = 1,278) were evaluated to identify children with specific
      reading disabilities. Reading disabled children with average intelligence were
      compared to normal controls on a series of neuropsychological tests to evaluate
      specific cognitive deficits associated with reading disorders in each country.
      The findings suggested that (a) dyslexia is more prevalent in the United States
      than in Italy, (b) reading disabilities are strongly associated with disorders of
      verbal processing in both countries, although some American dyslexics also show
      visual-motor deficits, and (c) there is a greater dissociation between reading
      comprehension and decoding in Italian than in English.

TI  - Phonetic speech perception deficits in dyslexia.
PG  - 480-6
AB  - Adult developmental dyslexics showed deficits in the identification of the vowels
      of English when the sole acoustic cues were steady-state formant frequency
      patterns. Deficits in the identification of place of articulation of the English 
      stop-consonants [b], [d] and [g] in syllable-initial position were also observed.
      The average consonantal error rate was 22%. These error rates are significantly
      different from those of nondyslexic control groups (p less than .01). No single
      deficit characterized the entire group of dyslexic subjects. The pattern of
      errors with respect to place of articulation also varied for different groups of 
      subjects. Three dyslexics have high vowel error rates and low consonantal error
      rates. The data are consistent with the premise that dyslexic subjects may have
      different perceptual deficits rather than a general auditory deficit involving
      the rate at which they can process perceptual information. The clinical histories
      of the present subjects suggest genetic transmission of these speech perception
      deficits. The presence of genetic variation in the biological substrate relevant 
      to the perception of human speech should be further explored.

TI  - The paradoxical relationship between intelligence and reading disability.
PG  - 1251-61
AB  - Specific reading disability or developmental dyslexia is a condition wherein an
      individual with average or superior intelligence does not acquire normal reading 
      skills. This paper provides a tentative explanation of the paradoxical
      relationship between the reading disability and intelligence. Study of 15
      dyslexic college students showed that they were deficient in grapheme-phoneme
      conversion and that the decoding skill could be an autonomous, specific ability
      that is independent of the "g" factor as expressed in terms of IQ. The decoding
      skill appears to be a subroutine and may, in dyslexia, operate as a limiting
      factor that affects reading comprehension.

TI  - The effects of piracetam in children with dyslexia.
PG  - 272-8
AB  - Following previous research which suggests that piracetam improves performance on
      tasks associated with the left hemisphere, a 12-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of developmental dyslexics was conducted. Six study
      sites treated 257 dyslexic boys between the ages of 8 and 13 years who were
      significantly below their potential in reading performance. Children were of at
      least normal intelligence, had normal findings on audiologic, ophthalmologic,
      neurologic, and physical examination, and were neither educationally deprived nor
      emotionally disturbed. Piracetam was found to be well tolerated in this study
      population. Children treated with piracetam showed improvements in reading speed.
      No other effects on reading were observed. In addition, improvement in auditory
      sequential short-term memory was observed in those piracetam-treated patients who
      showed relatively poor memory at baseline. It is suggested that longer term
      treatment with piracetam may result in additional improvements.

TI  - On the development of color naming in young children: data and theory.
PG  - 72-93
AB  - Among the semantics of different common attributes of the environment, consistent
      and correct color naming seems to develop paradoxically late in children, for
      even young infants discriminate and categorize colors well, color is a salient
      feature of the child's world, and children are aware of color as a separate
      domain, know color terms, and respond to color questions with color names.
      Several specific anomalies characterize early linguistic development in this
      domain: Errors in beginning color naming are perseverative or random, there seems
      to be a minimum age for correct and consistent color naming, developmental rate
      shows wide individual differences, and acquisition among girls is generally
      faster than among boys. This essay reviews data that support these observations, 
      and evaluates three traditional explanations for them--including the perceptual
      salience of color for children, experience and learning in the child, and
      cognitive development--against a fourth new possibility. It is hypothesized that 
      appropriate color naming may depend on the maturation and integration of specific
      cortical neurological structures; among several interpretations, the neurological
      one accounts best for diverse characteristics of early color naming.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: four consecutive patients with cortical anomalies.
PG  - 222-33
AB  - We report the neuroanatomical findings in 4 consecutively studied brains of men
      with developmental dyslexia. The patients, who ranged in age between 14 and 32
      years, were diagnosed as dyslexic during life. Nonrighthandedness and several
      autoimmune and atopic illnesses were present in the personal and family
      histories. All brains showed developmental anomalies of the cerebral cortex.
      These consisted of neuronal ectopias and architectonic dysplasias located mainly 
      in perisylvian regions and affecting predominantly the left hemisphere.
      Furthermore, all brains showed a deviation from the standard pattern of cerebral 
      asymmetry characterized by symmetry of the planum temporale. The neuroanatomical 
      findings in these 4 patients are discussed with reference to developmental
      cortical anomalies, cerebral asymmetries, reorganization of the brain after early
      lesions, and the association between learning disorders, left handedness, and
      diseases of the immune system.

TI  - Orthographic and phonetic coding in developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 325-40
AB  - Memory coding in dyslexic readers and reading-age-matched controls was
      investigated using cued recall. In the first phase of the experiment subjects
      made rhyme judgements about pairs of words. In the second phase one member of
      each pair (the cue) was used to cue recall of the other member of the pair (the
      target). Cues and targets were either rhyming and orthographically similar,
      rhyming and orthographically distinct, orthographically similar and not rhyming, 
      or unrelated. Dyslexics were as accurate at detecting rhyme compared to the
      reading-age-matched controls; however, they were slower and were subject to a
      greater orthography effect (Seidenberg & Tanenhaus, 1979). Overall memory
      performance did not differ between the two groups. However, dyslexics were found 
      to make more use of an orthographic code with both visual and auditory
      presentation. They made less use of a phonetic code in the visual but not the
      auditory condition. The results support the view that dyslexics have less easy
      access to a phonological code in memory, but they are able to compensate for this
      by increased use of a visual/orthographic code.

      aged 7-9 years. Among the possible causes they consider changing lateralization
      of extremities, absence of evident predominance of a hemisphere, acquiring of
      this writing by exercise through imitation with the left hand of the writing
      movements performed by the right hand, and the possibility of microtrauma of the 
      central nervous system. It is stressed that the mental development was normal and
      there were on features of developmental dyslexia.

TI  - The effect of syndrome diagnosis on speech remediation.
PG  - 47-68
AB  - On the basis of work reported by colleagues, as well as our own clinical research
      studies of patients with the aforementioned syndromes, there are now some useful 
      guidelines for appropriate remediation based on accurate initial diagnosis.
      Still, there is more to be learned about each of these syndromes. Furthermore,
      they represent but a small sample of a very large total. Recent literature has
      described the speech patterns of many more syndromes, as well as the genetic
      aspects of the more common speech and language disorders such as language delay, 
      dyslexia, autism, and stuttering [72-78]. The most common recognizable birth
      defect is Down syndrome and there is, fortunately, a large body of information
      detailing the varied language, speech, and hearing aspects [79]. Those of us who 
      work with children with Down syndrome have been alerted to the anticipated
      receptive and expressive language delays; the conductive and sometimes mixed
      hearing losses; the hoarse and raucous voices that are probably the result of a
      combination of anatomic, neurologic, and mucosal variations; the interesting
      disfluencies, and the amalgam of developmental and deviant articulatory errors.
      We know that although the tongue protrudes, it is rarely the true macroglossia
      which we would find in Beckwith syndrome, for example, but rather a hypotonic
      posture and a logical adaptation to an airway restricted by enlarged tonsils and 
      adenoids and recurrent rhinitis.

AB  - The relationship between sensory, perceptual and motor abilities and receptive
      language abilities was studied in developmental dysphasic children. The tests
      administered included experimental auditory, visual and cross-modal perceptual
      tests. In addition, a battery of neurodevelopmental "soft sign" sensory,
      perceptual and motor tests were also given. Demographic and case history data
      were collected. Receptive language was derived based upon a battery of
      standardized language tests. Multivariate analyses were employed to examine the
      relationship between receptive language and sensory, perceptual and motor
      abilities. Results demonstrated that auditory perceptual variables, specifically 
      those requiring rapid temporal analysis, were most highly correlated with the
      degree of receptive language deficit of the dysphasic children.

      ability. Significant correlations between symbolic play and expressive language
      ability were found for the mentally retarded children but not for those of normal

TI  - [Effects of classes in "creative movement and pantomime" and "badminton" on
      total-body coordination in older dyslexic boys].
PG  - 148-54
AB  - Reported previously from a U.S. empirical study of 7th grade high-school students
      (102 male and 84 female) where statistically significant results had been found
      relative to total body coordination and body image (Schneider, 1978), the
      effectiveness of a series of classes in "creative movement and pantomime" was
      verified in a 7.5-week longitudinal study of 7th grade male students (N = 20)
      attending remedial education at a special school for dyslexic students in
      Massachusetts, U.S.A. It has been possible to demonstrate that these classes had 
      achieved statistically significant improvements in overall body coordination of
      Ss, measured with the body coordination test KTK - Korper-Koordinationstest fur
      Kinder (Schilling, Kiphart, 1974). Findings obtained from the control group (N = 
      20) who, during that same period, had been taught, and practising, "Badminton" in
      the regular sports classes, elicited the same specific, statistically significant
      gains in overall body coordination. These improvements are considered
      attributable to the additional, specific stimuli for development provided to the 
      dyslexic students by "creative movement and pantomime" classes and the racket
      sport "Badminton" alike. The findings support the thesis that delayed formation
      of hemispheric linkage is present in dyslexic persons, and that specific movement
      programmes provide developmental stimuli that influence overall body
      coordination.

TI  - Children's memory for phonemically confusable and nonconfusable letters: changes 
      with age and reading ability.
PG  - 1845-54
AB  - This experiment focused on differences that occur with age and reading skill in
      the use of phonemic codes in short-term retention tasks where stimuli were
      presented visually. In 1 condition, individuals recalled 6-letter strings
      composed of rhyming and nonrhyming letters after a 15-sec delay under conditions 
      that permitted phonemic coding and rehearsal. 2 other conditions were designed to
      suppress (a) rehearsal of certain types of phonemic codes in the delay interval
      and (b) both phonemic coding at stimulus presentation and rehearsal. Subjects
      were grade 2 average readers matched in reading skill with grade 4 disabled
      readers, grade 4 average matched with grade 6 disabled, and grade 6 average
      matched with grade 4 superior readers. Average readers showed a decrease in
      errors with age in all 3 conditions, although performance was always better in
      the nonsuppression condition. In the latter, memory for nonrhyming letters was
      always better than memory for rhyming letters. Differential use of phonemic codes
      by good and poor readers in grades 4 and 6 was less than that found in previous
      research with younger children. Finally, by comparing the performances of grade 2
      average with grade 4 disabled readers and grade 4 average with grade 6 disabled
      readers, the developmental lag hypothesis of reading disability was examined.
      Problems with testing the hypothesis are discussed.

TI  - Developmental differences in the comprehension and production of narratives by
      reading-disabled and normally achieving children.
PG  - 1727-36
AB  - Reading-disabled children's language skills have long been implicated in their
      poor school performance. This study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal
      examination of the narrative language skills of both reading-disabled and
      normally achieving children in an attempt to understand more clearly the language
      processes involved in these skills and how these processes relate to reading
      achievement over time. Children were read scriptlike narratives and asked to
      demonstrate their knowledge of the story by a nonverbal enactment of the
      narrative. After perfect enactment of the story was assured, the children were
      asked to paraphrase the narratives. Results from both the cross-sectional and
      longitudinal study indicated that reading-disabled children comprehended the
      narratives in a comparable fashion to normal peers, but they performed more
      poorly on a variety of content and complexity measures derived from their
      paraphrases. The study indicates that reading-disabled children's language
      problems are persistent over time in the area of verbally expressing information,
      even when they have demonstrated nonverbal comprehension.

TI  - Development of health risk evaluation data for diagnostic ultrasound: a
      historical perspective.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - The growth of ultrasound applications in diagnostic medicine has helped stimulate
      related biological effects investigations. Current data related to effects
      associated with diagnostic ultrasound indicate the need for additional research
      on cell surface structures, motility and developmental effects. Research on
      biological effects, especially for evaluating in vivo end points analogous to
      those employed by investigators using in vitro systems and simple organisms, are 
      needed. Particular emphasis relative to potential effects on fetal and embroyonic
      development is indicated. Limited data also suggest the need to investigate
      possible effects on the immune response. There is a growing realization of the
      potential importance of nonthermal effects and increasing evidence that the
      temporal peak intensity is potentially related to the production of some effects.
      A number of recent comprehensive reviews have helped identify, analyze and
      evaluate some of the relevant data.

AB  - Seven-, ten-, and thirteen-year-old learning-disabled (LD) and

      30) were less likely to be recalled by the younger children than by the older
      children and by the LDs than by the NORMs. These findings provided support for
      the distinction between automatic and purposive semantic processing. NORMs'
      recall was governed by purposive semantic processing to a greater extent than was
      LDs' recall. However, no group or age differences were observed in automatic
      semantic processing.

TI  - Continuity between childhood dyslexia and adult reading.
PG  - 329-48
AB  - If reading disabilities were the result of developmental lags, disabled readers
      should catch up to their peers in proficiency at maturity. As a test of this
      hypothesis, current literacy skills were assessed for adults who did, and did
      not, have childhood reading disabilities. Contrary to the developmental lag
      hypothesis, most of the former group remained poor readers in adulthood, in many 
      cases reading more than two standard deviations below levels predicted by IQ.
      Both within and between groups, very similar relationships were observed between 
      reading level and: word recognition; phonic analysis; prose comprehension;
      reading speed; spelling ability and error types; and tolerance for visual and
      semantic text transformations. Other purported characteristics of dyslexia
      differentiated disabled from normal adult readers with only limited success. The 
      results have implications for theoretical, methodological, and practical issues
      in the study of dyslexia in childhood as well as adulthood.

TI  - A developmental perspective on reading dysfunction: accuracy and rate criteria in
      the subtyping of dyslexic children.
PG  - 67-91
AB  - Children referred with specific reading dysfunction were subtyped as accuracy
      disabled or rate disabled according to criteria developed from an information
      processing model of reading skill. Multiple measures of oral and written language
      development were compared for two subtyped samples matched on age, sex, and IQ.
      The two samples were comparable in reading fluency, reading comprehension, word
      knowledge, and word retrieval functions. Accuracy disabled readers demonstrated
      inferior decoding and spelling skills. The accuracy disabled sample proved
      deficient in their understanding of oral language structure and in their ability 
      to associate unfamiliar pseudowords and novel symbols in a task designed to
      simulate some of the learning involved in initial reading acquisition. It was
      suggested that these two samples of disabled readers may be best described with
      respect to their relative standing along a theoretical continuum of normal
      reading development.

TI  - Dichotic listening ear asymmetry: patterns of longitudinal development.
PG  - 49-66
AB  - Dichotic listening research with children has continued to be prevalent although 
      numerous authors have described both theoretical and methodological limitations
      with traditional dichotic listening free-recall paradigms. The present research
      adds to this growing skepticism by reanalyzing two major longitudinal studies of 
      children's ear asymmetries. These two studies, based in different countries
      (United States, Holland), utilized highly similar paradigms (free-recall digits),
      subjects (males), and age levels (kindergarten and second and fifth grade). The
      questions of ear advantage development, patterns of ear advantages, and the
      relationship between dichotic listening performance and reading skills are
      addressed from the multiple statistical methodologies represented in the
      literature. From these analyses, support for all of the major hypotheses
      regarding the developmental patterns of dichotic listening performances could be 
      obtained from the same data samples. The use of traditional free-recall dichotic 
      listening paradigms are not recommended for use with children. The implications
      for future research are discussed.

TI  - Developmental changes in the pattern of ear asymmetry as revealed by a dichotic
      listening task.
PG  - 5-17
AB  - Dichotic listening performance in 63 right-handed and 91 left-handed school-age
      children at various age levels were examined. Contrary to most previous research,
      a developmental change in the pattern of ear asymmetry was found most pronounced 
      in right-handers. An increasing proportion of children with right-ear advantage
      was found across age at the same time as the magnitude of this ear asymmetry
      decreased with increasing age. These results, however, were found only when the
      number of correct responses from the left and right ear were treated as
      relational data, and the pattern of ear asymmetry was calculated for each subject
      individually. When calculated as group means for each ear separately, the common 
      finding of no developmental change in the pattern of ear asymmetry was revealed. 
      The results are discussed in relation to research on myelogenetic correlates in
      linguistic development and on research concerned with different subgroups of
      dyslexia, as well as previous studies of developmental aspects of dichotic
      listening. Against this background it is suggested that a two-dimensional theory 
      must be used in interpreting developmental data in dichotic listening.

TI  - Development of phonetic memory in disabled and normal readers.
PG  - 187-206
AB  - The development of phonetic codes in memory of 141 pairs of normal and disabled
      readers from 7.8 to 16.8 years of age was tested with a task adapted from L. S.
      Mark, D. Shankweiler, I. Y. Liberman, and C. A. Fowler (Memory & Cognition, 1977,
      5, 623-629) that measured false-positive errors in recognition memory for foil
      words which rhymed with words in the memory list versus foil words that did not
      rhyme. Our younger subjects replicated Mark et al., showing a larger difference
      between rhyming and nonrhyming false-positive errors for the normal readers. The 
      older disabled readers' phonetic effect was comparable to that of the younger
      normal readers, suggesting a developmental lag in their use of phonetic coding in
      memory. Surprisingly, the normal readers' phonetic effect declined with age in
      the recognition task, but they maintained a significant advantage across age in
      the auditory WISC-R digit span recall test, and a test of phonological nonword
      decoding. The normals' decline with age in rhyming confusion may be due to an
      increase in the precision of their phonetic codes.

TI  - The impact of phonemic processing instruction on the reading achievement of
      reading-disabled children.
PG  - 97-118
AB  - It is hypothesized that a phonemic processing deficit is a primary causal factor 
      in the reading problems of many children with developmental dyslexia. An
      instructional model which emphasizes phonics instruction as a key in the
      treatment of children with reading disorders is presented. Procedures for the
      application of this model in a parent-involvement clinic program are described.
      Results from two typical children from the clinic sample who had received
      treatment for more than a year are presented. One Fourth-Grade child, who began
      the program with a 1 1/2-year reading deficit, was reading grade-appropriate
      material and scoring about 1 year above grade-norms on a standardized test after 
      14 months of clinic treatment. The second child began the treatment program as a 
      Sixth Grader who was virtually a non-reader. After 1 1/2 years of intervention,
      this child had attained a Third-Grade reading level, but was still nearly 4 years
      behind in reading. The pretest error responses to individual words made by both
      children are reviewed to demonstrate the underlying phonetic deficiency--an
      apparent difficulty with vowel sound correspondence. Averaged reading achievement
      results from 13 children who had received 3 months of instruction in an
      experimental study in which the instructional model is being used are presented. 
      Results indicate a dramatic change in the children's rate of reading achievement 
      during treatment. The children were divided into three groups on the basis of a
      measure of the transfer of phonic skills: normal transfer, poor transfer which
      improved dramatically in the first 3 months of treatment, and poor transfer which
      failed to improve. Analysis of the achievement data of these three groups
      indicates that the second group improved more rapidly than did the other two
      groups. It is suggested that further analyses of phonic transfer data may prove
      to be very instructive concerning the causes and treatment of developmental
      dyslexia.

PG  - 111-7
AB  - Longitudinal psychometric test data collected at two different ages (9.4 +/- 1.3 
      and 14.8 +/- 1.2 years) were utilized to compare the developmental rates of 69
      pairs of reading-disabled and matched control children. Results of a two-factor
      (GROUP X TIME), mixed-model, multivariate analysis of variance indicated that
      reading-disabled children manifested deficits on measures of academic
      achievement, symbolic processing speed and spatial reasoning abilities at both
      ages. Although both reading-disabled and control children were found to improve
      significantly between the two testing sessions, the lack of a significant GROUP X
      TIME interaction on measures of academic achievement and spatial reasoning
      abilities indicated that the rate of development was similar for the two groups. 
      For measures of symbolic processing speed, however, differences between
      reading-disabled and control children were somewhat greater at the later age.

AB  - In 19 children with acute infantile hemiplegia an ischemic cerebral infarct was
      found clinically and by serial computertomography. In 11 patients an angiography 
      has been performed in addition. 9 of the children had chronic diseases which are 
      known as predisposing factors for cerebrovascular disease (congenital heart
      disease in 7 and chronic renal failure with hypertension in 2). One child had a
      severe hypernatremic dehydration due to infantile diarrhea and in 1 child
      thrombosis of the internal carotid artery occurred 3 days after a perforating
      trauma of the soft palate. No obvious reason for the ischemic stroke could be
      evaluated in 8 children. The onset of symptoms was either acute or slowly
      progressive. An altered state of consciousness was present in 11 children.
      Hemiparesis was found in 18 patients (13 right, 5 left) accompanied by facial
      palsy in 12 and aphasia in 6. Seizures occurred in 6 patients. One patient with
      incomplete occlusion of a vertebral artery showed acute cerebellar ataxia. In
      children without predisposing factors the prevalence of girls was higher (2 : 6) 
      and there was a history of a preceding acute febrile illness in 5 of 8 patients. 
      Laboratory investigations showed polycythemia in 4 children with cyanotic heart
      disease and additional hypochromia in two. Blood sedimentation rate was increased
      in 6 out of 8 patients without a known predisposing factor. Cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) showed a slight increase of erythrocytes (36-88/cmm) in 4 children, in two 
      others purulent CSF was obtained after the infarct had developed into a brain
      abscess. The etiology of ischemic stroke in childhood and the possibility of an
      inflammatory vascular disease are discussed.

PG  - 344-8
AB  - This report describes an 8-year-old boy with congenital hereditary downbeat
      nystagmus, the youngest person with downbeat nystagmus in the literature to date 
      and the first to have an apparently congenital form. He had tended to keep his
      chin down since birth and had had difficulty reading since starting to attend
      school. His 28-year-old mother manifested a subclinical combined
      rotatory-downbeat nystagmus only in oblique downward gaze. Neither the child nor 
      the mother demonstrated evidence of spinocerebellar degeneration. Homologous
      base-up prisms incorporated into glasses eliminated his chin-down head posture,
      improved his vision in primary position and "cured" his so-called learning
      disability.

PG  - 783-93
AB  - A large sample of Dunedin (New Zealand) children was assessed at three, five and 
      seven years to study the prevalence and stability of language delay, and to
      investigate the association between language delay at each age and low
      intelligence and reading problems at age seven. The prevalence of specific
      comprehension delay, specific expressive delay, and general language delay varied
      from 2.0 to 4.3 per cent. General language delays were the most stable. Every
      type of language delay at each age, particularly earlier, general and stable
      delay was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of low intelligence
      or reading difficulties at age seven than among the total sample.

TI  - Links between literacy skills and accurate spatial relations in representations
      of the face: comparison of preschoolers, school children, dyslexics, and mentally
      retarded.
PG  - 659-66
AB  - A specific link is found between low or absent literacy skills and a specific
      misrepresentation of spatial relations exclusively of the upper part of the human
      face. This misrepresentation, determined by simple measurement, is found in 32%
      of the pictorial representations of 407 preschoolers whose drawings were
      published by various authors as well as in 32% of 44 preschoolers tested here. By
      contrast, after having had instruction in literacy, the proportion of such
      misrepresentations of the face drops to 7.5% and 10%, respectively, although, as 
      expected, not in the drawings by 236 mildly mentally retarded or by 297 dyslexic 
      children, 33% and 39% of whom, respectively, still misrepresent the face. In
      addition to a developmental factor, a further one, as yet undetermined, may be at
      work and related to a specific deficit in representing the spatial relations of
      the face. Data further support the previously suggested existence of a specific
      and general trend for a link between literacy skills and accurate representation 
      of the spatial relations of the pattern of the face also noted previously in
      diverse cultural groups and periods.

TI  - Finger localization and reading ability in three groups of children ages three
      through twelve.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - Developmental norms for eight finger-localization (FL) tasks similar to those
      used by Lindgren are extended to include 140 children ages 3 through 12. The
      strength of the relationship between these scores and two specific reading tasks 
      is explored. Regression analyses reveal statistically significant correlations
      between FL ability and the ability to match spoken with printed words, as well as
      between FL scores and scores for silent reading and retelling of a paragraph.
      Three groups of children are used: children with normal language, those with
      dysphasia, and those with language impairments other than dysphasia. Performance 
      scores of these three groups on other language tasks are compared.

PG  - 967-73
AB  - The authors experienced with four cases of brain abscess, one of which ruptured
      into the lateral ventricle. Two cases were treated conservatively and the
      remaining two were treated surgically. All cases recovered satisfactorily. Case
      1: A 30-year-old man with congenital cyanotic heart disease was admitted on Oct. 
      4, 1979, because of convulsion. Physical examination revealed motor aphasia,
      right hemihypesthesia, cyanosis, clubbed finger and continuous heart murmur. CT
      scan showed a ring-enhance mass lesion in the left temporal lobe. Although
      transient deterioration of the clinical course was observed, he improved
      satisfactorily after medical treatment of 20 days. Case 2: A 54-year-old man with
      left homonymous upper quadrantanopia and systolic heart murmur was admitted on
      Sept. 17, 1979. alpha-streptococcus was detected in the culture of his arterial
      blood. Vegetation near the mitral valve was revealed by ultrasonic cardiogram. CT
      scan showed an irregular and ill-shaped ring-enhanced mass in the left
      temporoparietal region. A saccular aneurysm in the insular portion of the
      posterior parietal artery was seen on the left carotid angiogram. He was also
      treated medically and the abscess was gradually reduced and the aneurysm
      disappeared. Case 3: A 28-year-old man complaining of headache, nausea and
      vomiting was admitted on Dec. 1, 1979. Physical examination revealed nuchal
      stiffness, right homonymous hemianopia and bilateral choked disc.(ABSTRACT

PG  - 463-8
AB  - In 14 patients, we encountered a behavioral syndrome that begins in early life
      and is characterized by emotional and interpersonal difficulties, shyness,
      visuospatial disturbances, and inadequate paralinguistic communicative abilities.
      All 14 patients had at least average intellectual capacity, but each had
      demonstrated some academic failure, particularly in arithmetic. Examination
      revealed neurologic and neuropsychological signs consistent with right-hemisphere
      dysfunction. Most of the patients avoided eye contact and lacked the gestures and
      prosody that normally accompany and accentuate speech. Although many of them
      could not convey their feelings, there was no evidence that they were unable to
      experience affect. Eight of them reported a family history of similar symptoms.
      Just as developmental involvement of the left hemisphere may produce dyslexia,
      damage to the right hemisphere suffered early in life, or inherited, may lead to 
      chronic emotional difficulties, a disturbance of interpersonal skills, and poor
      visuospatial ability.

TI  - The effect of time on the developmental test of visual motor integration.
PG  - 639-42
AB  - Studies have shown that many children with learning problems have difficulties of
      an integrative nature. In addition, these same children often require more time
      for visual information processing. In this study, the Developmental Test of
      Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) was given to children between the ages of 5 and 12
      years, the children being categorized into normal and learning problem groups.
      The forms were administered with and without a time restriction. It was
      hypothesized that the time restriction would result in lower scores for children 
      with visual motor perceptual deficiencies and learning problems than for those
      without. Results of the study showed a significant difference with time
      restrictions for children between ages 5 and 7 years and 9 year-1 month to 12
      years. This suggests that within these age groups, timing the test items of the
      VMI could supply additional information relative to visual motor perceptual
      development. In the middle age group, the test time appears to be too complex for
      children with visual motor perceptual deficiencies to complete.

TI  - Genetic influences on learning disabilities and speech and language disorders.
PG  - 369-87
AB  - This paper is a comprehensive review of known examples of genetically influenced 
      learning disabilities (LDs) and speech and language disorders (SLDs). The review 
      is divided between 2 broad classes of studies: (a) those which begin with an LD
      or SLD phenotype that appears to be familial and attempt to learn more about the 
      specifics of genetic transmission, if any; and (b) those which begin with a group
      of individuals, all of whom share a given documented genetic risk factor, to see 
      if it leads to a specific LD or SLD. Included in the first category are familial 
      dyslexia, stuttering, and other speech and language disorders. In the second
      category are included sex chromosome anomalies, treated PKU, and minor autosomal 
      anomalies. Issues of definition, variability, and developmental changes in the
      cognitive phenotype are discussed throughout. The implications of this work for
      our understanding of cognitive development and its bases in brain development and
      genetics are also discussed.

TI  - EMG and EEG biofeedback training in the treatment of a 10-year-old hyperactive
      boy with a developmental reading disorder.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - The serial application of electromyographic (EMG) and sensorimotor (SMR)
      biofeedback training was attempted with a 10-year-old boy presenting a triad of
      symptoms: an attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity, developmental reading
      disorder, and ocular instability. Symptom elimination was achieved, for all three
      aspects of the triad, following the procedure of first conditioning a decrease in
      EMG-monitored muscle tension and then conditioning increases in the amplitude of 
      sensorimotor rhythm over the Rolandic cortex. The learned reduction of monitored 
      EMG levels was accompanied by a reduction in the child's motoric activity level
      to below that which had been achieved by past administration of Ritalin. In
      addition, the attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity was no longer
      diagnosable following the EMG biofeedback training. The learned increase in the
      amplitude of monitored SMR was accompanied by remediation of the developmental
      reading disorder and the ocular instability. These results remained unchanged, as
      ascertained by follow-ups conducted over a 24-month period subsequent to the
      termination of biofeedback training.

PG  - 1303-10
AB  - About the middle cerebral artery occlusion with moyamoya phenomenon, we have
      reported the clinical and angiographical study of 10 cases. Now we present an
      autopsy case. A 53-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on May, 22, 1978,
      two hours after an apparent subarachnoid hemorrhage. Neurological examination
      revealed drowsiness, nuchal rigidity right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. Left
      carotid angiogram showed an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery at its
      origin with moyamoya phenomenon, but did not demonstrate an occlusion and/or
      stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid artery. Furthermore right carotid
      and bilateral vertebral angiograms were normal. The hospital course was
      progressively uphill, and she did not have any focal neurological deficits at
      discharge. But she committed suicide with a poison (Paraquat) on August, 19,
      1978. Histopathologic examination of the left middle cerebral artery revealed a
      stenosis, with a maximum diameter of 900 microns. In this portion the lumen was
      not be occluded, and arteriosclerotic and inframatric exchanges were not present.
      The elastica interna was reduplicated, frayed and at times discontinuous. The
      tunica media was very thin or disappeared. On the other hand, moyamoya vessels
      were found between distal and peripheral portion of the stenotic middle cerebral 
      artery as a collateral circulation. These findings suggested that the stenotic
      arterial wall of the left middle cerebral artery might be a congenital
      hypoplasia.

      for speech and language is present at the time of language origins (developmental
      invariance) or whether it gradually develops from initial bilaterality
      (developmental progression). Thus controversy is complicated by conflicting
      reports of the incidence of childhood aphasia. The discrepancies are largely due 
      to one early study. When methods for estimating speech organization distributions
      are applied to later studies, the developmental invariance position is supported.

TI  - The assessment of children with specific reading difficulties (dyslexia) using
      the British Ability Scales.
PG  - 461-78
AB  - The use of the British Ability Scales with children having specific reading
      difficulties is described. Eighty-three children aged eight to 16 years were
      given a number of subtests from the British Ability Scales, and their performance
      on each subtest compared to every other subtest. The children were also divided
      into three age groups and developmental differences observed. Based on T scores
      the children scored significantly less well on Speed of Information Processing,
      Immediate and Delayed Visual Recall, Recall of Digits, Basic Arithmetic and Word 
      Reading across all the age ranges, when compared to the other abilities. In
      general subtests involving Speed of Precessing and Short Term Memory were poor,
      whereas tasks involving Reasoning, Spatial Imagery and aspects of the Use of the 
      Retrieval of Knowledge were found to be average or above average. Expected
      reading ages for the children based on other abilities were calculated, and it
      was found that the children's reading abilities were well below the expected
      level. Various forms of intelligence quotient were also computed and it is
      suggested that the four abilities recommended for use in computing an IQ in the
      current BAS Manual are inappropriate for the dyslexic child. The children were
      also divided into auditory-linguistic and visuo-spatial 'subtypes' of dyslexia,
      and significant differences were found between the groups on Speed of Information
      Processing, Recall of Digits, and Block Design Level and Power. The data are
      related to previous work in the area of developmental dyslexia.

PG  - 191-208
AB  - The present paper reviews, outlines, and explores the literature concerned with
      the speech-language disorder of childhood autism. The problems of communication
      of the autistic child are compared and contrasted with those of children with a
      variety of other language disorders (e.g. receptive developmental dysphasia).
      Based upon the review of normal preverbal communicatory and symbolic development,
      it is concluded that childhood autism involves a pervasive language disorder
      encompassing communication in general, as well as certain
      symbolic-representational abilities necessary for language. An overview of the
      attempts to teach speech to autistic children in then undertaken with special
      emphasis on the possible implications of developmental knowledge for these
      training pursuits. Finally, the role of neurologic substrates in the language and
      communication disorder of autism is presented.

AB  - 2 groups of language-disordered children were studied regarding the reading
      levels reached at the end of the first year of school. The first group was
      composed by children with language retardation mainly on phonological level, the 
      second group was composed by children with retardation also on semantic-syntactic
      level. The results confirmed the strong association between reading disability
      and language disorders and yielded significant differences between the two
      groups: the reading achievement seemed to be associated mainly to semantic and
      syntactic competences.

      shorter variation in RT depending on the kind of surrounding material. This
      suggests that the filtering mechanism whereby unnecessary information is avoided 
      becomes more efficient from the first to the second grade of school attendance.

AB  - Nine children suffering from Landau-Kleffner syndrome and 25 children with
      developmental expressive disorder were tested for comprehension of the
      grammatical structure of English in spoken, written and signed (Paget-Gorman)
      language modalities. It is shown that the comprehension problems of children with
      landau-Kleffner syndrome are not restricted to spoken language, but are also
      found when written or signed language is used. Further, in all three language
      modalities these children show deviant patterns of comprehension consistent with 
      the notion that they treat language as having a sequential rather than a
      hierarchical structure. However, similar patterns of performance are found in
      profoundly deaf children, indicating that peripheral auditory deprivation is a
      sufficient condition for these deviant patterns of comprehension to develop.

TI  - [Crossed aphasia in right-handed patients. II. Neuropsychological and
      neurolinguistic study of a case. Evolution over a 2 year period].
PG  - 587-600
AB  - We present an unusual case of crossed aphasia in a doctor who is totally right
      handed, following an infarction which almost completely destroyed his right
      hemisphere. The observations--linguistic and extra linguistic--during a study
      over two years are presented. The aphasia evolved in three stages, taking
      semiological and evolutive aspects not commonly met with. In speech and writing
      there were: 1. an oral agrammatism and a written dyssyntaxia in the initial
      stage; 2. the evolution of a non-fluent speech typically agrammatic leading to a 
      jargonaphasia; 3. a dissociation between oral and written language, characterised
      by phonemic paraphasias in speech and dyssyntaxia in writing. Comprehension was
      good except for a verbal class called "empty signs" of language, in which the
      lexic which refers to the notion of space and time has a primary role. On an
      extra linguistic level some of the usual signs of right hemisphere lesions were
      present indicating disturbances of a spatial type. The patient could no longer
      grasp the concept of numerical value and showed severe difficulties in relation
      to time. On a linguistic level, the discussion is first considered from a
      typological point of view; this allows to compare our patient's disorders with a 
      Broca's then with a conduction aphasia, Secondly, the discussion is considered
      from a semiological point of view, taking into consideration the 10 selected
      cases in the literature and adding our own; a semiological formula of crossed
      aphasia is given: agrammatism and/or dyssyntaxia + phonemic paraphasia and/or
      dysorthographia. A suggestion concerning the role of each hemisphere in the
      language of our patient is proposed: the possible role played by a congenital
      deafness in the right ear (discovered in the patient at the age of 8) to explain 
      this abnormal hemispherical functional specialisation is discussed. Original
      comprehension difficulties concerning the time-space lexic are replaced by a
      perspective of a cognitive type. We conclude that in our patient, there was a
      "breakdown" of time and space which comes close to the "indifferenciation" of
      spatial order and time which Piaget has described in children.

TI  - Communication development and its disorders: a psycholinguistic perspective.
PG  - 279-93
AB  - There is a reciprocal relationship between the study of language disorders and
      research in normal language development. Recent studies in normal acquisition
      have led to a model of language development that includes not only linguistic
      achievements, but the development of social and cognitive abilities that lay the 
      basis for the transition from prelinguistic communication to the use of
      conventional forms. This model has been applied to the study of developmental
      disorders of language learning. Such a model allows the more puzzling disorders
      of language development, such as childhood aphasia and primary autism, to be
      placed in a framework that predicts language disruption when underlying
      perceptual, cognitive, or social abilities are lacking. Assessment procedures
      that can be drawn from the model of language disorders are presented. It is
      argued that the study of these disabilities is important in the building of
      theoretical models of intact language processing that specify more precisely the 
      contribution of underlying skills to overall functioning. Questions for future
      research that serve this reciprocal purpose are discussed.

TI  - Durations of recognition for single letters, with and without visual masking, by 
      dyslexics and normal readers.
PG  - 991-5
AB  - Two sets of letters, i.e., those subject to reversal/rotation such as b, d, p,
      and q, and others, e, i, u, w, x, and o, were tachistoscopically presented singly
      to 15 normal readers (aged 6 to 14 yr.) and 29 dyslexic children (aged 7 to 13
      yr.). Half the presentations were subject to masking by visual noise. Contrary to
      a prediction based on temporal-sequencing deficiency, the dyslexics required a
      significantly longer time than normals for recognition. This occurred under both 
      the masked and non-masked conditions. Reversible/rotational letters gave more
      difficulty than other letters only when masked, for both normals and dyslexics.
      This supports the hypothesis that these letters have no special relation to
      dyslexia. The view that dyslexia is a developmental anomaly was supported by the 
      finding of a significant correlation between recognition-speed and age for the
      normal readers only.

      There were, however, proportionately more symmetric occipital widths than
      expected in comparison with a control sample and previously established norms.
      Differences in verbal or performance IQs were not related to relative cerebral
      size. Language delay was also not associated with brain measurements. The CCT may
      be increasing in use as a tool in the investigation of children with
      developmental dyslexia. We conclude that CCT is not warranted unless an
      underlying disorder associated with significant neurologic signs is discovered by
      examination.

TI  - Infantile autism and the temporal lobe of the brain.
PG  - 317-30
AB  - Studies are reviewed that support the hypothesis that infantile autism results
      from a neuropathology of the temporal lobes of the brain. First, there are
      parallels between symptoms noted in autism and those found in the Kluver-Bucy and
      amnesic syndromes. Second, there is a similarity between developmental dysphasia 
      and autism. Third, the formation of cross-modal associations may be deficient in 
      autistic children, a symptom resembling aspects of Geschwind's disconnection
      syndromes. Finally, a large number of organic factors have been associated with
      the development of autism, some of these having specific implications for
      temporal lobe involvement. It is concluded that the main autistic symptoms are
      most consistent with a neurological model involving bilateral dysfunction of the 
      temporal lobes. Individual differences in the extent of bilateral involvement
      and/or other coexistent neuropathologies could contribute to the heterogeneity of
      the autistic population.

      Mastery Tests were explored for 80 developmentally disabled children. While the
      children's reading skills correlated moderately and significantly with
      intellectual status, abstract reading skills, e.g., word comprehension,
      correlated more highly with Full Scale IQ than did concrete ones, e.g., word
      identification. The development of concrete learning patterns by such children
      was discussed, with an emphasis on the emotional importance of these learning
      styles to the children and their families.

TI  - Developmental language disorders: cognitive processes, semantics, pragmatics,
      phonology, and syntax.
PG  - 57-74
AB  - Five areas of research concerned with language acquisition--cognitive processes, 
      semantics, pragmatics, phonology, and syntax--are reviewed in terms of their
      contribution to understanding language disorders. Two views of cognitive
      processes are discussed. One of these, emphasizing cognitive mechanisms such as
      short-term memory, is seen as providing possible explanations for some types of
      language deficits. The other, a concern with conceptual knowledge, is subjected
      to a critical analysis questioning how complete an explanation it is able to
      offer for some aspects of language acquisition. Problems of definition are also
      discussed when semantic aspects of language are considered. Problems in the
      pragmatic component of language are seen as providing an explanation for
      particular aspects of language disorder in some autistic children. The importance
      of focusing on phonology as a central grammatical process is discussed and linked
      to dyslexia and to spelling disorders. Finally, it is argued that the acquisition
      of syntactic structure is not yet understood. Impairments such as a hierarchical 
      planning order deficit may affect syntactic ability and lead to disordered
      language, as found in some types of developmentally aphasic children. It is
      concluded that it is important to study all five areas of the title, and their
      interrelationships, if various language disorders are to be adequately
      understood.

AB  - A consecutive unselected series of 200 children referred for psychiatric
      consultation to an Italian Child Guidance Center is included in this study. All
      diagnoses were made in accord with the third edition of the "Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM III). Functional enuresis was the
      most common psychiatric disturbance (15 percent), followed by developmental
      reading disorder (14.5 percent) and mild mental retardation (12.5 percent). There
      was no case of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (hyperkinetic
      syndrome). All depressions were consequences of another disorder and remitted
      when the child received attention and care. In 20.5 percent of cases no
      psychiatric diagnosis was made and the child apparently had been referred because
      of emotional problems in the parent.

PG  - 487-503
AB  - A detailed investigation of short-term memory storage, long-term memory storage
      and semantic memory associated with developmental dyslexia is reported. Fifty-one
      dyslexic and 28 control children were tested, and the following deficits were
      found amongst the dyslexic children. Short-term memory functions were impaired
      both with respect to storage capacity and rate of decrement. Long-term memory
      functions for visual material were normal but verbal long-term memory functions
      were impaired. There was evidence of difficulties in incorporating new material
      into semantic memory but the rate of accessing information from within this
      system appeared to be normal. The significance of the memory deficits is
      discussed in relation to the hypothesis that childhood dyslexia is a double
      deficit of the graphemic-phonemic and graphemic-semantic reading routes.

TI  - Central auditory testing and dyslexia.
PG  - 972-84
AB  - A group of dyslexic pupils with normal end organ function was studied by a
      central auditory battery to determine whether a hearing disability existed. The
      clinical features of dyslexia are presented with emphasis on the psychological
      developmental and functional disorders associated with this reading problem. The 
      central battery of Willeford was selected as the test medium and the results of
      the 77 dyslexic students were compared to the normative data. The model proposed 
      by Sparks, et al., is accepted as the mechanism for dichotic audition. Reference 
      is made to the organic basis of reading disorders from lesion in the calcarine
      area to the angular gyrus. The competing sentence test, binaural fusion, rapidly 
      alternating speech perception, and filtered speech are described in detail and
      are organic foundation for the study. The authors indentified a high rate of
      failure in this investigation. Over 50% of the dyslexic students failed two of
      the four tests, and each of the 77 failed at least one component. The most
      sensitive tests were binaural fusion and filtered speech with less variation from
      the norm in the remaining two components. The effect of maturation in central
      audition was measured in each of the four tests. The data suggest: 1. the scores 
      are lower in the early ages in each test; 2. that rapidly alternating speech and 
      competing sentences approach the normal range albeit somewhat delayed; and 3.
      that binaural fusion and filtered speech improve in score somewhat but rather
      moderately and never approach the normal range. Based upon the central auditory
      data and in conjunction with the anatomical pathways of vision, the authors
      suggest the site of lesion to be in the temporo-parietal cortex and the
      association fibers.

      purport to be effective for a wide range of problems. These are generally empiric
      in origin, and the efficacy of most of them cannot be supported by controlled

      group made significant gains in reading as compared to the control group. The
      improvement in basic instructional level of The Informal Reading Inventory
      (Temple University), and the Word Reading and Paragraph Meaning subtests of the
      Stanford Achievement Tests, and the actual classroom reading levels were all
      statistically significant. The Informal Word Recognition Inventory (Daniels) and 
      the Spelling subtest of the Stanford Achievement Tests showed a definite trend
      approaching statistical significance.

PG  - 1-14
AB  - Serum dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity was measured in 44 children with
      psychiatric disorders and 44 controls in order to determine significant variables
      affecting its potential use as a marker for specific molecular pathology in the
      neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood. The assay procedure was reliable and the
      serum enzyme activity for individuals appears to be stable. There is a very broad
      distribution of serum DBH activity in the population, and it is similar in males 
      and females. The genetic determination of serum DBH activity was clear in this
      study, and the enzyme activity increased with age through childhood and
      adolescence. Thyroid hormone had no effect on serum DBH activity in euthyroid
      subjects. No difference in mean serum DBH activity emerged across diagnostic
      groups. When the findings were considered in relation to the results of other
      studies, it was concluded that the wide range of serum DBH activities in normal
      and patient populations, as well as developmental effects on the activity of the 
      enzyme, make comparison of DBH activity among diagnostic groups in childhood
      difficult. Large subject groups, and a consideration of genetic and developmental
      effects, will clarify possible syndrome-related differences in enzyme activity.

PG  - 301-5
AB  - A 32-year-old woman had a history of left temporal and occipital bone defects
      since her infancy and she developed left exophthalmos in the last three years
      following a ormin head injury. The left eye ball was displaced downward and
      rotated nasally, and she was unable to move the left eye voluntarily beyond the
      mid-line. The left eye ball could not be rotated beyond the mid-line even by
      muscle traction. Skull x-rays and carotid angiograms showed various abnormalities
      of skull dysplasia and positional abnormalities of intracranial arteries.
      Pneumoencephalography demonstrated dilatation of the arterior and temoral horns
      of the left lateral ventricle. Cranioplasty was performed and postoperative
      vasospasm occurred in the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries, causing 
      right hemiparesis and aphasia. Congenital vascular abnormality in
      neurofibromatosis was discussed in relation to the cerebral vasospasm.

TI  - Selective attention deficits in poor readers? Dichotic listening, speeded
      classification, and auditory and visual central and incidental learning tasks.
PG  - 1050-61
AB  - Poor readers (PRs) and controls (i.e., normal readers) from the second, fourth,
      and sixth grades were compared on four tasks chosen to measure the development of
      selective attention. The PRs performed more poorly than controls on the central
      but not on the incidental portion of an auditory memory task. The differences on 
      the central task were interpreted as a function of group differences in mnemonic 
      skills rather than selective attention. There were no group differences on either
      central or incidental portions of a visual memory task. In a speeded
      classification task, PRs exhibited a slower rate of information processing,
      measured in bits of information transmitted per second, than controls, but this
      difference in rate was not affected by distraction. On a dichotic listening task,
      PRs performed more poorly than controls under a variety of conditions in which
      the presence of distraction, the rate of information presentation, and attended
      ear were manipulated; the pattern of differences obtained, however, was not
      readily interpretable as a function of greater distractibility on the part of PRs
      than controls. As a whole, the results did not support the hypothesis that PRs
      show deficits in selective attention relative to age-matched normal readers. In
      addition, correlations computed among indices of selectivity (residualized gain
      scores) derived from the four tasks were uniformly low, suggesting that the four 
      tasks did not measure the same cognitive construct. The implications for the
      study of reading disabilities and for the construct of selective attention in
      developmental studies are discussed.

PG  - 1413-8
AB  - Acute right hemiplegia and transient expressive aphasia occurred in a 7-year-old 
      girl a few days after nonspecific constitutional symptoms and the appearance of a
      large right submandibular lymph node. Biopsy of this node and lack of other
      evident cause suggested a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease. Carotid arteriography
      showed a localized arteritis of the supraclinoid part of the left internal
      carotid artery and the left middle cerebral artery, involving also some
      lenticulostriate vessels. Computerized tomography demonstrated infarction in the 
      left internal capsule. The size of this infarct and the angiographic
      abnormalities improved 6 weeks after onset, and coincided with clinical recovery.
      Cat-scratch disease may have caused the localized arteritis.

TI  - On the relationship of hemispheric specialization and developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 471-81
AB  - Hemispheric specialization for linguistic material was compared for normal and
      dyslexic subjects under dichotic listening (Experiment 1) and hemi-retinal
      presentation (Experiment 2) conditions. In both experiments, group data indicated
      that dyslexic subjects were, overall, less accurate in their performance than
      normals but that both groups showed similar right ear/visual field superiority.
      However, examination of individual subjects scores in both experiments indicated 
      that the distribution of lateralization scores for dyslexic subjects was bimodal,
      whereas that for normal subjects was unimodal. These results suggest that the
      dyslexic 'population' is heterogeneous with regard to cerebral lateralization and
      that previous work treating it as homogeneous is most likely misleading. It
      appears important to both carefully examine individual subject data in such
      studies and to consider the consequences of there being different types of
      cerebral lateralization etiologies for what has been typically considered to be a
      homogeneous dyslexic population.

AB  - 100 consecutively referred school-age children were evaluated for learning or

      Operational criteria for childhood depression, specific learning disability,
      developmental hyperactivity, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome were used to
      establish the correct diagnosis in 55 children. 32 children had a single
      diagnosis, while 23 children fulfilled the criteria of two diagnostic categories.
      The diagnostic categorization permitted specific counseling of the child and
      family, development of a proper school program, and correct pharmacotherapy (when
      indicated).

AB  - Rapid progress in the study of learning disabilities requires a common context
      within which investigators and professionals with very diverse backgrounds can
      work towards common goals. Much evidence points to the heterogeneity of origin
      and clinical expression of learning disabilities as well as to many other ways in
      which they resemble such multifactorial conditions as mental retardation, gout
      and hypertension. In these conditions, genetic and epidemiological methods have
      been used to sort out the constitutional and environmental factors which
      precipitate disease in susceptible persons. Such an approach to learning
      disabilities can be expected to be rewarding.

AB  - The classic pathognomic signs of dyslexia, such as reversals and rotations,
      appear to be associated with poor reading, not diagnosed developmental dyslexia. 
      26 8th and 9th grade dyslexia with poor perceptual/attentional ability were
      matched with 19 reading-retarded subjects with age-equivalent
      perceptual/attentional test scores for age, IQ, and degree of reading retardation
      and compared both with each other and with 96 adequate readers for reversals,
      rotations, insertions, substitutions, omissions, poor handwriting and visual
      ability on the Gray test, the WRAT Spelling Test, a writing task, and the
      star-tracing mirror test. On 46 of 49 variables, the dyslexia and retarded
      readers performed comparably. Together they made more classic errors and had
      lower achievement scores than the adequate readers on 44 of 49 variables. Classic
      errors clustered with poor reading but not diagnosed dyslexia. The hypothesis
      that reading acquisition trains perceptual test-taking ability is advanced.

TI  - Reading reversals and developmental dyslexia: a further study.
PG  - 496-510
AB  - The pattern of errors in reading isolated words was studied in two groups of
      children with respect, particularly, to reversals of letter sequence and letter
      orientation. One group (the Institute group) consisted of children 8 to 10 years 
      old who had been diagnosed "dyslexic" according to medical and psychoeducational 
      criteria. The other (the School group) included all the children in a second-year
      elementary school class (see Liberman, Shankweiler, Orlando, Harris and Berti,
      1971) who fell into the lowest third on a standard test of reading achievement.
      Although the Institute children were somewhat poorer in word recognition than the
      backward readers selected purely on psychometric grounds, the groups did not
      differ significantly in the incidence of reversal errors. Also, for both groups, 
      reversals represented a small proportion of the total number of reading errors.
      The performance of the two groups differed in two respects: in relation to
      directional bias in letter reversals and in the presence or absence of a
      significant correlation between letter-reversing and word-reversing tendencies.
      It was concluded from this that directional problems do not loom large in
      importance in most cases of reading backwardness, but may provide an additional
      source of difficulty for some dyslexic children. Other aspects of the error
      pattern were remarkably the same for both groups. The bulk of reading errors made
      by both groups reflect their common difficulties in phonemic segmentation of
      words in the lexicon, in phonetic recoding, and in mastery of the
      orthography--difficulties, in short, with linguistic characteristics of words
      rather than with their properties as visual patterns.

AB  - The developmental, psychological, and educational sequelae of chronic otitis
      media occurring during the first three years of life were investigated in a
      selected group of children with educational difficulties. One group of children
      had a history of chronic and severe otitis media, requiring myringotomy after 3
      years of age. The control group had infrequent and relatively mild episodes of
      otitis media and no surgical intervention. Children with chronic and severe
      otitis media manifested substantial delays in speech and language, auditory
      processing deficits, disturbances in auditory-visual integration, reading
      disorders, and poor spelling skills. Early medical and educational intervention
      for children with a high-risk profile of language delay and severe chronic otitis
      media is suggested as a possible strategy for preventing the development of a
      specific learning disability.

TI  - Dyscalculia and elements of the developmental Gerstmann syndrome in school
      children.
PG  - 197-206
AB  - Fourteen (14) dyscalculic school children were drawn from a larger population of 
      learning-disabled children. The subjects were divided into two groups, those with
      normal-or-better reading ability and those with dyslexia equal in degree to their
      dyscalculia. Both groups showed a variety of behavioral deficits in addition to
      those comprising Gerstmann's syndrome and were notably poor in auditory and
      visual discrimination and motor coordination. Good readers showed
      severely-impaired ability to make right-left discriminations, while the poor
      readers were average in this ability. Poor readers showed marked impairment of
      word fluency and hand writing, while good readers were average in this regard.
      The dyscalculia and reading deficits reported here appear unrelated to
      central-language impairment. Subjects with all four elements of the developmental
      Gerstmann's syndrome did not constitute an homogeneous behavioral group and were 
      found among samples of both good and poor readers. The pattern of behavioral
      deficits shown by these subjects suggests cerebral impairment rather than slow
      maturation as a probable etiology. While the DGS is not useful as a behavioral

TI  - Development of information processing in normal and disabled readers.
PG  - 1047-54
AB  - 8- and 11-yr-old reading-disabled children were compared in two experiments with 
      controls matched on intelligence and age. Exp. 1 measured duration of visual
      information store by means of a separation threshold technique. Exp. II
      determined the rate of transfer from visual information store to short-term
      memory using a backward masking technique. Results from Exp. I showed that at
      each age specific reading-disabled children had significantly longer durations of
      visual information store than controls. The difference between the reading
      ability groups decreased with increasing age. Exp. II demonstrated that rate of
      transfer of information was significantly slower for specific reading-disabled
      children than for controls at both age levels. In contrast to Exp. I, this
      difference increased with increasing age. The results are considered in terms of 
      their possible relevance to developmental lag theories. The evidence indicates
      that the development of visual information processing in reading-disabled
      children is similar to that in controls but occurs at a slower rate.

PG  - 61-9
AB  - A comparative study of nonverbal MA matched groups of five autistic, five
      aphasic, five normal and five retarded children was made on an auditory-visual
      and a visual-visual paired-associate learning task. The results showed that,
      although the autistic and receptive aphasic children were both unable to
      associate sounds with their visual counterparts at the same rate as normal
      children, the aphasic children overcame this deficit at a significantly faster
      rate than autistic children. This study pinpoints one dysfunction that could
      subsume the severe verbal comprehension defect in autistic and aphasic children.

TI  - Developmental disabilities.
PG  - 93-9
AB  - The concept of developmental disabilities as a group of problems with origins in 
      the stages of human development has been broadened by recent legislation to
      include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, dyslexia, and other
      neurological impairments. The debate continues on whether or not specific
      disability categories should be named, but the functional aspects of the problems
      seem to be generally accepted. Potential implications of this legislation for
      occupational therapy are discussed in this paper. Numerous programs supported by 
      a variety of governmental units and private agencies will need qualified
      professionals. This paper concludes with a brief list of six developmental
      disability programs of the University of Michigan University Affiliated Facility 
      and an outline of three models of field placement in developmental disabilities
      for occupational therapy students.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia. Evidence for a subgroup with a reversal of cerebral
      asymmetry.
PG  - 90-2
AB  - The computerized brain tomograms of 24 patients with developmental dyslexia were 
      analyzed for cerebral asymmetry. Ten patients showed a reversal of the pattern of
      asymmetry regularly observed in normal right-handed individuals so that the right
      parietooccipital region was wider than the left. The ten dyslexic patients with
      this reversal of cerebral asymmetry had a lower mean verbal IQ than the other 14 
      dyslexic patients in this study. The reversal of cerebral asymmetry that occurred
      in ten of the dyslexic patients may result in language lateralization to a
      cerebral hemisphere that is structurally less suited to support language function
      and thus act as a risk factor for the development of reading disability.

TI  - Inter- versus intra-hemispheric learning in dyslexic and normal readers.
PG  - 71-80
AB  - The present study investigated the hypothesis that developmental dyslexia is
      attributable to dysfunction in inter-hemispheric transfer. Dyslexic and normal
      readers in second grade (age-range seven to eight years) and sixth grade (11 to
      12 years) were given tachistoscopic presentations of novel visual stimuli
      (Chinese ideographs), randomly presented to the left and right visual fields and 
      to the central fixation point. Each stimulus was paired with a common English
      word (spoken) and the children were asked to associate the two. The transmission 
      deficit hypothesis predicts that poor and normal readers will be differentiated
      in the case of presentations to the right hemisphere (left visual field) but will
      not differ significantly in the case of presentations to the left hemisphere
      (right visual field). This hypothesis was not supported. Normal readers at both
      grade levels performed significantly better than poor readers in both
      visual-field presentations.

PG  - 115-34
AB  - Specific developmental dyslexia, a condition characterized by reduced reading,
      spelling, and writing abilities combined with normal intellectual capacity, has
      challenged geneticists and 'environmentalists.' Although most of the strikingly
      controversial results can be traced to differences concerning diagnostic
      decision-making, there are many hints of a genetic contribution. Twin studies and
      extensive pedigree analysis substantiate this view, but it is too early to infer 
      a definite mode of inheritance from the available data.

PG  - 1-7
AB  - A case of intracranial saccular aneurysm occurring in early childhood and
      presenting with sudden dysphasia and hemiplegia is reported. A review of the
      literature emphasizes the rarity of this lesion. Despite a significant
      preoperative neurological deficit, the patient tolerated aneurysm clipping and
      recovered well. The majority of reported cases involve males under 2 years old.
      Aneurysms in infants have a distribution different from that seen in adults.
      Microscopic examination of these lesions fails to show any evidence of
      inflammation or atherosclerosis. The data suggest that the pathogenesis of these 
      rare childhool lesions differs from that of adult saccular aneurysms.

TI  - Manual asymmetries of motor sequencing in boys with reading disability.
PG  - 343-9
AB  - Boys with reading disability were asked to tap two mechanical keys in time to the
      beat of a metronome, with left and right hand alone, and with alternating hands. 
      On the single hand trials these boys tapped as well as normal boys with both left
      and right hands, but when asked to alternate hands, their tapping stability,
      particularly of the left hand, deteriorated significantly and was worse than that
      of much younger normal boys. It is argued from evidence from patients with
      surgical commissurotomies that the motor deficiency in synchronizing left and
      right hands may be due to a disturbance in interhemishperic cooperation in the
      boys with reading disability, and it is suggested that the reading problems of
      these children may be the consequence of a developmental delay in
      interhemispheric cooperation.

AB  - A psychometric, observational, and interview study was undertaken with 47 boys,
      aged 4 1/2 to 10 years, with nonverbal IQs of 70+ and a severe developmental
      disorder of language comprehension. Separate discriminant function analyses,
      based on behavioral, language, or cognitive features, showed little overlap
      between clinically defined autistic and dysphasic subgroups. Moreover, the
      discrimination could be made as clearly on language or cognitive characteristics 
      as on social or behavioral critera. Language abnormalities and behavioral
      features also intercorrelated within the autistic subgroup. It is concluded that 
      autism and dysphasia differ in important ways and that a cognitive deficit is an 
      essential part of the syndrome of autism.

TI  - Families of autistic and dysphasic children. II. Mothers' speech to the children.
PG  - 313-27
AB  - This paper tests various hypotheses about deviance in the communication of
      mothers to their autistic children. The language of mothers of 13 autistic boys
      is compared to the language of mothers of 13 boys with developmental receptive
      dysphasia. The two groups of boys are of similar age, nonverbal intelligence, and
      language level. The language samples come from hour-long taped interactions
      between the mothers and their children in their homes. Aspects of maternal
      communication that are examined include: the amount of language used, the
      frequency usage of different types of utterances, the syntactic complexity of
      utterances, the grammaticality of utterances, the clarity of communication, and
      the tones of voice used. No differences were found between the two groups of
      mothers in level of language usage, pattern of functional interaction, or in
      overall clarity of communication. In conclusion, the findings of this study
      provide no support for the suggestion that autism is due wholly or in part to
      deviant patterns of mother-child communication.

TI  - Classification of reading problems by the Q-technique of factor analysis.
PG  - 281-94
AB  - The Q-technique of factor analysis was used to define subtypes of reading
      problems in terms of performance on 31 tests of rapid reading skills. Subjects
      included a group of 34 children with learning problems, language problems, and
      mental retardation. Three subgroups were identified within each group by the
      statistical classification procedure. For the reading group, one subgroup was
      characterized by slow oral word reading, a second by slow auditory-visual letter 
      association, and a third by slow auditory-visual association of words and
      syllables. The first and second subgroups for the mixed group were essentially
      the same as the second and third subgroups for the reading group, and the third
      subgroup was characterized by slow visual matching. These results were compared
      with those of previous investigators, none of whom used multivariate
      correlational procedures for classifying reading disabilities. It was concluded
      that the use of statistical classification techniques would greatly facilitate
      the achievement of a consensus regarding the number and the types of
      developmental reading disabilities.

      angiography and disappearance of most neurological signs after the operation
      showed that the chronically ischaemic parts of the brain resumed their functions.

TI  - The determination of speech organization in a patient with an arteriovenous
      malformation.
PG  - 111-3
AB  - A case is reported of an arteriovenous malformation in the left motor speech area
      which was successfully excised without aphasia in a right-handed man.
      Preoperative sodium amobarbital carotid infusion testing demonstrated that the
      patient had right hemisphere dominance for speech. A review of the literature
      suggests that this is not an uncommon occurrence in individuals with congenital
      lesions of the left cerebral hemisphere. Lateralization of speech dominance
      should be established through definitive testing in these cases, especially if
      surgical removal of the malformation is contemplated.

TI  - Developmental dyslexia: two right hemispheres and none left.
PG  - 309-11
AB  - Developmental dyslexia may be associated with (i) bi-hemisphere representation of
      spatial functions, in contrast to the right-hemisphere specialization observed in
      normal children, and (ii) typical left-hemisphere representation of linguistic
      functions, as is observed in normal children. The bilateral neural involvement in
      spatial processing may interfere with the left hemisphere's processing of its own
      specialized functions and result in deficient linguistic, sequential cognitive
      processing and in overuse of the spatial, holistic cognitive mode. This pattern
      of cognitive deficits and biases may lead dyslexics to read predominantly with a 
      spatial-holistic cognitive strategy and neglect the phonetic-sequential strategy.
      Such an approach in learning to read phonetically coded languages, such as
      English, many be inefficient and limited.

      incidental learning.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The performance of poor readers and control children at three grade levels,
      first, third, and fifth grades, was compared on an incidental learning task
      adapted by Hagen (1967). A significant group by task interaction in a repeated
      measures ANOVA indicated that reading ability was differentially related to
      performance on the tasks. Relative to control children at all grade levels, poor 
      readers obtained lower scores on the central task and higher scores on the
      incidental task. The absence of a grade X task X reading ability interaction
      indicated that selective attention follows the same developmental course in poor 
      readers as in control children. The data suggest that the development of
      selective attention as reflected in performance on this task is delayed from 2 to
      4 years in poor readers.

TI  - A neurophysiological basis of developmental dyslexia.
PG  - 47-64
AB  - Recent advances in the understanding of the asymmetrical functions of the
      cerebral hemispheres provide new insight to the mechanisms underlying the
      developmental language disorders. It is probable that learning to read depends in
      part upon the ability to establish an association between a seen object
      (customarily perceived within the right hemisphere) and a verbal symbol (mediated
      by the left). It is possible that as the reading skill develops, verbal symbol
      recognition may also become a left hemisphere function. A complex interaction
      between the two developing hemispheres is involved. A clue to the nature of this 
      problem is that developmental dyslexia is six times more common in boys than in
      girls. Studies defining differences in cerebral dominance in boys and girls will 
      be reviewed in this context.

TI  - Eye movements during reading: case reports.
PG  - 389-95
AB  - Since the time of Javal, it has been well established that normal reading eye
      movement patterns have 3 principal components: (1) small saccades that move the
      eyes from word to word, (2) large saccades that return the eyes to the beginning 
      of the next line, and (3) fixation pauses between each saccade for information
      processing. We discuss the vision analysis results and show the quantitative
      reading eye movement records, measured with the infrared photoelectric method, of
      5 patients examined in the Neuro-optometry Clinic. The reading records showed a
      wide variety of behavior: 1 patient performed normal reading movements, 1 "slow
      reader" manifested an excessive number of fixations as well as extended
      fixational durations, another "slow" reader only exhibited an excessive number of
      fixations, a patient with dyslexia performed backward reading movements, and 1
      patient exhibited nystagmus superimposed upon the reading pattern.

TI  - The syndrome of autism: a critical review.
PG  - 609-21
AB  - The authors review the clinical features and behavioral characteristics of
      autism; differential diagnosis of the syndrome; clinical, neurophysiological, and
      biochemical research; and its medical management and treatment. They conclude
      that autism is a behaviorally defined, specific syndrome that is manifested at
      birth or shortly thereafter. Its symptoms are expressive of an underlying
      neuropathophysiological process that affects developmental rate; modulation of
      perception; language, cognitive, and intellectual development; and the ability to
      relate. The long-term prognosis is guarded; almost all patients manifest severe
      symptomatology throughout their lives. Further basic research into the
      neuropathophysiological process underlying the syndrome is necessary in order to 
      reach the ultimate goal of developing etiologically specific treatment programs.

TI  - Creatine phosphokinase levels in children with severe developmental disturbances.
PG  - 683-6
AB  - Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were studied in individuals: 40
      psychotic children suffering from childhood autism, atypical personality
      development, and childhood schizophrenia; five children with childhood aphasia;
      22 children with severe personality disorders; 29 normal children and normal
      siblings of psychotic children; and 14 normal parents of psychotic children.
      Creatine phosphokinase levels from the entire population of adults and children
      were normally disturbed, and the mean CPK levels for the eight diagnostic groups 
      were within normal limits. Those 22 children with personality disorders had
      significantly higher CPK levels than the other diagnostic groups. This relatively
      higher level of CPK may be related to vulnerability to later development of
      schizophrenic spectrum disorders. There was no apparent relationship between CPK 
      levels and motor activity, nor was there any change in the level of CPK during a 
      trial of psychoactive medication. Creatine phosphokinase levels remained
      relatively stable on test-retest determination.

TI  - Specific language disorders in twins during childhood.
PG  - 366-8
AB  - The delay in the development of the language often found in twins is usually
      interpreted as being strictly connected with the twinning situation and on the
      assumption that a model of verbal, tendentially cryptophasic, communication would
      more easily exist between twins. Two types of language pathology in twins,
      diverging from this classic framework, are presented: (1) Developmental dyslalia 
      (or developmental dysarthria); in these cases no abnormality could be found in
      the modality of verbal communication between the cotwin; (2) developmental
      dysphasia; in these cases not only no tendency toward cryptophasia was observed, 
      but indeed the verbal communication between the twins was markedly reduced. These
      two types of language disorders, as well as the classic one, are discussed in the
      light of a neurolinguistic interpretation.

TI  - Grammatical impairment in developmental aphasia.
PG  - 264-82
AB  - The language production of a 23 year old patient with developmental aphasia
      caused by birth injury was analyzed in detail within the framework of Chomsky's
      generative grammar. It was shown that different stages of grammatical development
      occur simultaneously, without the predominance of those grammatical forms which
      are identical with or close to adult grammar. Thus the language of this patient
      with developmental aphasia is quite comparable to the language of children from 3
      to 6, and shares many features with grammatical impairment well known from
      agrammatism and paragrammatism in adult aphasia. It was suggested that in
      developmental aphasia incomplete linguistic generalizations are related to an
      incomplete maturation of inhibitory functions during language acquisition,
      whereas in adult aphasia comparable forms of less advanced grammars are set free 
      by dissolution of function.

TI  - Perceptual and linguistic factors in the language impairment of developmental
      dysphasics: an experimental investigation with the token test.
PG  - 196-205
AB  - Twelve developmental dysphasics and twelve control children were tested on De
      Renzi and Vignolo's Token Test. The performance of the dysphasics, though
      significantly poorer than that of the controls on Parts 2-5 of the test, seemed
      to follow a similar pattern. Both groups were errorless on the initial parts of
      the test. As the demand on auditory retention increased on subsequent parts of
      the test, the performance of both groups progressively deteriorated. However, the
      addition of grammatical complexity on Part 5, rather than causing even further
      deterioration in performance, actually served to improve the performance of both 
      groups, though not significantly. Although the pattern of errors made by the two 
      groups was similar, the quantity of errors made by the dysphasics, as compared to
      the normal control children, demonstrated the magnitude of the dysphasic
      children's receptive language impairment. Analysis of errors indicated that
      dysphasic children have greater difficulty with auditory retention and verbal
      memory than they do with the grammatical or structural complexity of language. It
      is suggested that the observed gross language impairment of developmentally
      dysphasic children does not result, at least primarily, from a specific inability
      to analyze the linguistic components of language. Rather, the language impairment
      of these children appears to reflect their primary inability to analyze the rapid
      stream of acoustic information which characterizes speech and is essential to
      normal speech perception and language development.

      not differ in any respect from a comparison group of patients with central
      nervous system dysfunction unassociated with the symptom complex of autism. Both 
      groups of patients had a high incidence of low birthweight, complications of
      pregnancy and the neonatal period, seizure disorders, and a variety of specific
      disease entities associated with developmental defects. Follow-up of 40 of the 45
      survivors for a mean of five years showed that none of the patients had had
      treatment directed to their psychotic symptoms. However, three fourths had
      established social responses appropriate to their level of function; those who
      did not generally were over 3 years of age at the time of their first examination
      or had initial DQs of 35 or less. The degree of mental deficiency was as great or
      greater at follow-up than it was initially.

PG  - 93-8
AB  - The comparative performance in the repetition of a set of sentences was
      investigated in 8 children with developmental aphasia, average 5-7 years and 8
      dyslalic ones, average 5-3 years. None presented any hard neurological signs. A
      battery of sentences was devised for repetition purpose and used as stimulus.
      Production proved to be less advanced in the group of children with developmental
      aphasia characterized as follows: highly systematic reduction of the models, lack
      of consistency in the substitutions both on the phonetic and the lexical levels
      ill-formed constructions in certain types of structures, high percentage of
      omission of function words. The dyslalic children's performance however proved to
      be more advanced and the subjects reproduced well-formed sentences in every
      single sentence regardless of the sentence length or type. The test devised might
      turn out to be helpful in practice for the correct diagnosis between patients
      with developmental aphasia and children with multiple and complex dyslalias.

AB  - A taxonomy of error--regarding the visual, grapheme-phoneme, and semantic aspects
      of reading--is proposed; and it is related to data from developmental studies. A 
      preliminary analysis of recovery curves, based on the performance of two patients
      in tests of word-reading and object-naming, is also presented. Finally, the
      problem of extrapolating from test data to functional efficiency is briefly
      discussed.

TI  - Childhood autism. A review of the clinical and experimental literature.
PG  - 21-47
AB  - This review of the literature on childhood autism discusses the clinical
      characteristics, differential diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the autistic 
      behavioral syndrome from a developmental perspective. It includes a discussion of
      the influence of prenatal and perinatal antecedents, genetic and socio-familial
      factors, and epidemiologic considerations. Neurologic, electro-encephalographic
      and experimental neurophysiologic, metabolic, biochemical and hematologic
      investigations are reviewed. Special emphasis has been given to the changing
      clinical manifestations which accompany maturation and to the problems of
      recognition of childhood autism in the very young child.
